            "content": "The Mendocino Presbyterian Church is an historic Carpenter Gothic style Presbyterian church building located at 44831 Main Street, in Mendocino, California. Built of coast redwood, it sits on the Mendocino headlands overlooking the Pacific Ocean; its board and batten exterior walls, tall side-entrance bell tower, steep gabled roof and lancet windows are typical of many Carpenter Gothic churches. Its stained glass windows were made by local stained glass artist Leone McNeil Zimmer.\n\nThe church is California Historical Landmark No. 714 and is also a contributing property in the Mendocino and Headlands Historic District which was added on July 14, 1971, to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was designed by architects S. C. Bugbee & Son of San Francisco and was built between 1867-1868 at a cost of $10,000 by contractor Albert Maxwell. On July 5, 1868, it was formally dedicated. It served as the model for the more elaborate Church of the Good Shepherd, Berkeley that S. C. Bugbee's son Charles L. Bugbee designed in the late 1880s.\nIn 1947 parts of the movie Johnny Belinda, which starred Jane Wyman and Lew Ayres, were filmed on the premises and the church received enough money to buy a new roof.\n\n\n== Current status ==\nToday the church is an active congregation in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and is one of the oldest continuously-used Protestant churches in California. The Rev. Dr. Donald W. McCullough, former president of San Francisco Theological Seminary, is the current pastor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMendocino Presbyterian Church website\nOne of many photos on flickr: Mendocino Presbyterian Church (at sunrise)\nAnother flickr photo",

It is formed from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Qadir. The name means \"servant of the powerful\", Al-Q\u0101dir being one of the names of God in the Qur'an, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.\nThe letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abdal. The second part can be transliterated Qader, Kadir, Qadir,Kader, Gadir or in other ways, and the whole name subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.\nThere is a related but much less common name, Abdul Qadeer (Arabic: \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u06cc\u0631\u200e), with a similar meaning.

            "content": "The Noite com Danilo Gentili (English: Overnight with Danilo Gentili) is a Brazilian television program hosted by the stand-up comedian Danilo Gentili, which is currently produced and broadcast by SBT. Gentili, previously, presented for about three years the Agora \u00c9 Tarde, from March 29, 2011 until December 31, 2013, on Band network. The Band network output and going to the SBT is due to conflicts with the producer of his former show, Eyeworks, and with the restrictions that the network intended to put in the show.\nThe show genre is late-night talk show, a talk show subgenre, that have as some of its features the presence of comedy and the broadcasts in the late night schedule. The show debuted on March 10, 2014, and since then the program will air during the five working days a week around midnight, after the primetime shows. The show is record in the SBT studios located at Osasco, city of Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, location where their production is installed.\nIn addition to having Gentili as host, the also stand-up comedians L\u00e9o Lins and Murilo Couto are cast members of the show, which also includes the announcer Diguinho Coruja, the stage assistant Juliana Oliveira and four members of the show house band, Ultraje a Rigor, being them Roger Moreira (vocal), Mingau (bass), Marcos Kleine (guitar) and Bacalhau (drums). The soundtrack played by Ultraje a Rigor in the show was released as a digital album called Por que Ultraje a Rigor?, Vol. 2.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Creation and debut of Agora \u00c9 Tarde ===\nIn 2008, during one of his presentations of the Clube da Com\u00e9dia, a stand-up comedy show, Danilo Gentili was invited by Diego Barreto to make the segment Rep\u00f3rter Inexperiente in the new Band network show, Custe o Que Custar (CQC). With successful of the segment, Gentili becames an official reporter of the show.\nIn the next year, Gentili presented to the Band network direction a project of late-night talk show created by him and Alex Baldin, at that time was the CQC head of script. In this project, already provided his name, Agora \u00c9 Tarde, Ultraje a Rigor as the house band, and the comedians L\u00e9o Lins and Murilo Couto in the show cast. To put the show on the air, Gentili demanded that the network record a pilot of the show as a condition for his contract renewal. The station only allowed the pilot recording in 2010, and chose the producer Eyeworks, owner of CQC format, to produce the show.\nAgora \u00c9 Tarde premiered on June 29, 2011, initially broadcast two times per week. From the success of the show, which greatly increased the network audience, the broadcast days have been increased, causing the show to be shown four times per week.\n\n\n=== Output of Band ===\nIn December 2013, the Band network was experiencing a financial restructuring, causing a decrease in the show run time, losing a day broadcast for a rerun of the show best moments, also decreasing the Agora \u00c9 Tarde staff as a way to contain costs. When receiving a proposal from SBT, in which remove the limitations that the Band put in show production, the show staff decided to accept it in a consensus decision.\nThe narrator Marcelo Mansfield, regret having promised to go with the Agora \u00c9 Tarde staff to SBT, decided to continue as a Band employee. Mansfield explained that chose to continue in the Band for never broken a contract during his career and he would not join the show cast without all its original formation. Contrary to its justification, Mansfield remained in the show, which has to be hosted by Rafinha Bastos.\nWith the change to SBT, the Band network and producer Eyeworks began to treat them as enemies. Not having a narrator, since Mansfield remains in Band, Gentili chose the radio host Diguinho Coruja to replace Mansfield as the show narrator. With the announcement of their hiring by SBT, Coruja was dismissed from the radio station Band FM, which belongs to the same owners of Band network, the Grupo Bandeirantes de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o. Band filed a lawsuit against Gentili, in which he demanded that the host returned to the station and also trying to prevent the debut of its show in SBT, also defining as the creator of the show format. The process was denied by the justice.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website",

            "content": "Parry Hiram Moon (; 1898\u20131988) was an American electrical engineer, who with Domina Eberle Spencer co-authored eight scientific books and over 200 papers on subjects including electromagnetic field theory, color harmony, nutrition, aesthetic measure, and advanced mathematics. He also developed a theory of holors.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nParry Hiram Moon was born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin to Ossian C. & Eleanor F. (Parry) Moon. He received a BSEE from University of Wisconsin in 1922 and an MSEE from MIT in 1924. Unfulfilled with his work in transformer design at Westinghouse, Moon obtained a position as research assistant at MIT under Vannevar Bush. He was hospitalized for six months after sustaining injuries from experimental work in the laboratory. He later continued his teaching and research as an associate professor in MIT's Electrical Engineering Department. He married Harriet Tiffany, with whom he had a son. In 1961, after the death of his first wife, he married his co-author, collaborator and former student, Domina Eberle Spencer, a professor of mathematics. They have one son. Moon retired from full-time teaching in the 1960s, but continued his research until his death in 1988.\n\n\n== Scientific contributions ==\nMoon\u2019s early career focused in optics applications for engineers. Collaborating with Domina Eberle Spencer, he began researching electromagnetism and Amperian forces. The quantity of papers that followed culminated in Foundations of Electrodynamics, unique for its physical insights, and two field theory books, which became standard references for many years. Much later, Moon and Spencer unified the approach to collections of data (vectors, tensors, etc.), with a concept they coined as \u201cholors\u201d. Through their work, they became disillusioned with Einsteinian relativity and sought neo-classical explanations for various phenomena.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nParry Moon, The Scientific Basis of Illuminating Engineering, McGraw-Hill, 608pp. (1936) (ASIN B000J2QFAI).\nParry Moon, Lighting Design, Addison-Wesley Press, 191pp. (1948) (ASIN B0007DZUFA).\nParry Moon, A Proposed Musical Notation, (1952) (ASIN B0007JY81G).\nParry Moon & Domina Eberle Spencer, Foundations of Electrodynamics, D.

            "content": "The corpus spongiosum is the mass of spongy tissue surrounding the male urethra within the penis. Also called the corpus cavernous urethrae in older texts.\n\n\n== Anatomy ==\nBehind, it is expanded to form the urethral bulb, and lies in apposition with the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, from which it receives a fibrous investment.\nThe urethra enters the bulb nearer to the superior than to the inferior surface. On the latter there is a median sulcus (groove), from which a thin fibrous septum (wall) projects into the substance of the bulb and divides it imperfectly into two lateral lobes or hemispheres.\nThe portion of the corpus spongiosum in front of the bulb lies in a groove on the under surface of the conjoined corpora cavernosa penis. It is cylindrical in form and tapers slightly from behind forward. Its anterior end is expanded in the form of an obtuse cone, flattened from above downward. This expansion, termed the glans penis, is moulded on the rounded ends of the corpus cavernosum penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces.\nAt the summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical opening known as the external urethral orifice, or the urinary meatus.\nThe circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border, the corona of glans penis, overhanging a deep retroglandular sulcus, behind which is the neck of the penis.\n\n\n== Function ==\nThe function of the corpus spongiosum in erection is to prevent the urethra from pinching closed, thereby maintaining the urethra as a viable channel for ejaculation. To do this, the corpus spongiosum remains pliable during erection while the corpora cavernosa penis become engorged with blood.\n\n\n== Additional images ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nCorpus cavernosum penis\nSpongy urethra\nTrabeculae of corpus spongiosum of penis\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThis article incorporates text in the public domain from page 1248 of the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnatomy photo:44:06-0204 at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center - \"The Male Pelvis: The Urethra\"",

            "content": "Column chromatography in chemistry is a chromatography method used to purify individual chemical compounds from mixtures of compounds. It is often used for preparative applications on scales from micrograms up to kilograms. The main advantage of column chromatography is the relatively low cost and disposability of the stationary phase used in the process. The latter prevents cross-contamination and stationary phase degradation due to recycling.\nThe classical preparative chromatography column is a glass tube with a diameter from 5 mm to 50 mm and a height of 5 cm to 1 m with a tap and some kind of a filter (a glass frit or glass wool plug \u2013 to prevent the loss of the stationary phase) at the bottom. Two methods are generally used to prepare a column: the dry method and the wet method.\nFor the dry method, the column is first filled with dry stationary phase powder, followed by the addition of mobile phase, which is flushed through the column until it is completely wet, and from this point is never allowed to run dry.\nFor the wet method, a slurry is prepared of the eluent with the stationary phase powder and then carefully poured into the column. Care must be taken to avoid air bubbles. A solution of the organic material is pipetted on top of the stationary phase. This layer is usually topped with a small layer of sand or with cotton or glass wool to protect the shape of the organic layer from the velocity of newly added eluent. Eluent is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material. Often a spherical eluent reservoir or an eluent-filled and stoppered separating funnel is put on top of the column.\nThe individual components are retained by the stationary phase differently and separate from each other while they are running at different speeds through the column with the eluent. At the end of the column they elute one at a time. During the entire chromatography process the eluent is collected in a series of fractions. Fractions can be collected automatically by means of fraction collectors. The productivity of chromatography can be increased by running several columns at a time. In this case multi stream collectors are used. The composition of the eluent flow can be monitored and each fraction is analyzed for dissolved compounds, e.g. by analytical chromatography, UV absorption spectra, or fluorescence. Colored compounds (or fluorescent compounds with the aid of a UV lamp) can be seen through the glass wall as moving bands.\n\n\n== Stationary phase ==\n\nThe stationary phase or adsorbent in column chromatography is a solid. The most common stationary phase for column chromatography is silica gel, the next most common being alumina. Cellulose powder has often been used in the past. Also possible are ion exchange chromatography, reversed-phase chromatography (RP), affinity chromatography or expanded bed adsorption (EBA). The stationary phases are usually finely ground powders or gels and/or are microporous for an increased surface, though in EBA a fluidized bed is used. There is an important ratio between the stationary phase weight and the dry weight of the analyte mixture that can be applied onto the column. For silica column chromatography, this ratio lies within 20:1 to 100:1, depending on how close to each other the analyte components are being eluted.\n\n\n== Mobile phase (eluent) ==\n\nThe mobile phase or eluent is either a pure solvent or a mixture of different solvents. It is chosen so that the retention factor value of the compound of interest is roughly around 0.2 - 0.3 in order to minimize the time and the amount of eluent to run the chromatography. The eluent has also been chosen so that the different compounds can be separated effectively. The eluent is optimized in small scale pretests, often using thin layer chromatography (TLC) with the same stationary phase.\nThere is an optimum flow rate for each particular separation. A faster flow rate of the eluent minimizes the time required to run a column and thereby minimizes diffusion, resulting in a better separation. However, the maximum flow rate is limited because a finite time is required for the analyte to equilibrate between the stationary phase and mobile phase, see Van Deemter's equation. A simple laboratory column runs by gravity flow. The flow rate of such a column can be increased by extending the fresh eluent filled column above the top of the stationary phase or decreased by the tap controls. Faster flow rates can be achieved by using a pump or by using compressed gas (e.g. air, nitrogen, or argon) to push the solvent through the column (flash column chromatography).\n\nThe particle size of the stationary phase is generally finer in flash column chromatography than in gravity column chromatography. For example, one of the most widely used silica gel grades in the former technique is mesh 230 \u2013 400 (40 \u2013 63 \u00b5m), while the latter technique typically requires mesh 70 \u2013 230 (63 \u2013 200 \u00b5m) silica gel.\nA spreadsheet that assists in the successful development of flash columns has been developed. The spreadsheet estimates the retention volume and band volume of analytes, the fraction numbers expected to contain each analyte, and the resolution between adjacent peaks. This information allows users to select optimal parameters for preparative-scale separations before the flash column itself is attempted.\n\n\n== Automated systems ==\n\nColumn chromatography is an extremely time consuming stage in any lab and can quickly become the bottleneck for any process lab. Therefore, several manufacturers like Biotage, Buchi, Interchim and Teledyne Isco have developed automated flash chromatography systems (typically referred to as LPLC, low pressure liquid chromatography, around 350\u2013525 kPa or 50.8\u201376.1 psi) that minimize human involvement in the purification process. Automated systems will include components normally found on more expensive high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems such as a gradient pump, sample injection ports, a UV detector and a fraction collector to collect the eluent. Typically these automated systems can separate samples from a few milligrams up to an industrial many kilogram scale and offer a much cheaper and quicker solution to doing multiple injections on prep-HPLC systems.\nThe resolution (or the ability to separate a mixture) on an LPLC system will always be lower compared to HPLC, as the packing material in an HPLC column can be much smaller, typically only 5 micrometre thus increasing stationary phase surface area, increasing surface interactions and giving better separation. However, the use of this small packing media causes the high back pressure and is why it is termed high pressure liquid chromatography. The LPLC columns are typically packed with silica of around 50 micrometres, thus reducing back pressure and resolution, but it also removes the need for expensive high pressure pumps. Manufacturers are now starting to move into higher pressure flash chromatography systems and have termed these as medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) systems which operate above 1 MPa (150 psi).\n\n\n== Column chromatogram resolution calculation ==\n\nTypically, column chromatography is set up with peristaltic pumps, flowing buffers and the solution sample through the top of the column. The solutions and buffers pass through the column where a fraction collector at the end of the column setup collects the eluted samples. Prior to the fraction collection, the samples that are eluted from the column pass through a detector such as a spectrophotometer or mass spectrometer so that the concentration of the separated samples in the sample solution mixture can be determined.\nFor example, if you were to separate two different proteins with different binding capacities to the column from a solution sample, a good type of detector would be a spectrophotometer using a wavelength of 280 nm. The higher the concentration of protein that passes through the eluted solution through the column, the higher the absorbance of that wavelength.\nBecause the column chromatography has a constant flow of eluted solution passing through the detector at varying concentrations, the detector must plot the concentration of the eluted sample over a course of time. This plot of sample concentration versus time is called a chromatogram.\nThe ultimate goal of chromatography is to separate different components from a solution mixture. The resolution expresses the extent of separation between the components from the mixture. The higher the resolution of the chromatogram, the better the extent of separation of the samples the column gives. This data is a good way of determining the column\u2019s separation properties of that particular sample. The resolution can be calculated from the chromatogram.\nThe separate curves in the diagram represent different sample elution concentration profiles over time based on their affinity to the column resin. To calculate resolution, the retention time and curve width are required.\nRetention time is the time from the start of signal detection by the detector to the peak height of the elution concentration profile of each different sample.\nCurve width is the width of the concentration profile curve of the different samples in the chromatogram in units of time.\nA simplified method of calculating chromatogram resolution is to use the plate model. The plate model assumes that the column can be divided into a certain number of sections, or plates and the mass balance can be calculated for each individual plate. This approach approximates a typical chromatogram curve as a Gaussian distribution curve. By doing this, the curve width is estimated as 4 times the standard deviation of the curve, 4\u03c3. The retention time is the time from the start of signal detection to the time of the peak height of the Gaussian curve.\nFrom the variables in the figure above, the resolution, plate number, and plate height of the column plate model can be calculated using the equations:\nResolution (Rs)\nRs = 2(tRB \u2013 tRA)/(wB + wA)\nWhere:\ntRB = retention time of solute B\ntRA = retention time of solute A\nwB = Gaussian curve width of solute B\nwA = Gaussian curve width of solute A\nPlate Number (N):\nN = (tR)2/(w/4)2\nPlate Height (H):\nH = L/N\nWhere L is the length of the column.\n\n\n== Column adsorption equilibrium ==\nFor an adsorption column, the column resin (the stationary phase) is composed of microbeads. Even smaller particles such as proteins, carbohydrates, metal ions, or other chemical compounds are conjugated onto the microbeads. Each binding particle that is attached to the microbead can be assumed to bind in a 1:1 ratio with the solute sample sent through the column that needs to be purified or separated.\nBinding between the target molecule to be separated and the binding molecule on the column beads can be modeled using a simple equilibrium reaction Keq = [CS]/([C][S]) where Keq is the equilibrium constant, [C] and [S] are the concentrations of the target molecule and the binding molecule on the column resin, respectively. [CS] is the concentration of the complex of the target molecule bound to the column resin.\nUsing this as a basis, three different isotherms can be used to describe the binding dynamics of a column chromatography: linear, Langmuir, and Freundlich.\nThe linear isotherm occurs when the solute concentration needed to be purified is very small relative to the binding molecule. Thus, the equilibrium can be defined as:\n[CS] = Keq[C].\nFor industrial scale uses, the total binding molecules on the column resin beads must be factored in because unoccupied sites must be taken into account. The Langmuir isotherm and Freundlich isotherm are useful in describing this equilibrium. Langmuir Isotherm:\n[CS] = (KeqStot[C])/(1 + Keq[C]), where Stot is the total binding molecules on the beads.\nFreundlich isotherm:\n[CS] = Keq[C]1/n\nThe Freundlich isotherm is used when the column can bind to many different samples in the solution that needs to be purified. Because the many different samples have different binding constants to the beads, there are many different Keq\u2019s. Therefore, the Langmuir isotherm is not a good model for binding in this case.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for column chromatography using high pressure.\nFast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) for separation of proteins using column chromatography.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlash Column Chromatography Guide (pdf)",

            "content": "Sergio Ferrara (born May 2, 1945) is an Italian physicist working on theoretical physics of elementary particles and mathematical physics. He is renowned for the discovery of theories introducing supersymmetry as a symmetry of elementary particles (super-Yang\u2013Mills theories, together with Bruno Zumino) and of supergravity, the first significant extension of Einstein's general relativity, based on the principle of \"local supersymmetry\" (together with Daniel Z. Freedman, and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen). He is an emeritus staff member at CERN and a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nSergio Ferrara was born on 2 May 1945 in Rome, Italy. He graduated from the University of Rome in 1968. Since then he has worked as a CNEN and INFN researcher at the Frascati National Laboratories; as a CNRS Visiting Scientist at the Laboratoire de Physique Th\u00e9orique, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Paris, and at the Theory Division at CERN, Geneva.\n\n\n== Conformal field theory ==\nIn 1971\u20131975, Sergio Ferrara did pioneering work on Conformal Field Theory and the Conformal bootstrap. In a series of papers written in collaboration with Raoul Gatto, Aurelio Grillo and Giorgio Parisi, he studied constraints imposed by conformal symmetry on the operator dimensions, the form of the correlation functions, the operator product expansion, and the conformal partial wave expansion for the four-point correlation functions of the theory. This work, together with the contemporaneous work by Alexander Polyakov, laid the foundations of Conformal Field Theory.\n\n\n== Supergravity ==\nIn 1976, Sergio Ferrara, Daniel Z. Freedman, and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen discovered Supergravity at Stony Brook University in New York. It was initially proposed as a four-dimensional theory. The theory of supergravity generalizes Einstein's general theory of relativity by incorporating the principles of supersymmetry.\n\n\n== Later years ==\nIn 1980 he was made a full professor of theoretical physics in Italy. He became a staff member of the Theory Division at CERN in 1981. In 1985, he became a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Since 1986 he has been a senior staff member of the Physics Department at CERN. During the years 2010-2014 he has been a Guest Professor at CERN as Principal Investigator of the European Research Council Advanced Grant SUPERFIELDS. He is currently a senior staff member, emeritus, at CERN.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nPrix Scientifique de l'UAP, 1991, Paris.\n\n\"For contributions to Conformal Field Theory and to the discovery of Supergravity\"\n\nDirac Medal, 1993, ICTP, Trieste. (Shared with Daniel Z. Freedman, and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen)\n\n\"For their discovery of supergravity theory in 1976 and their major contributions in the subsequent developments of the theory.

            "content": "Snowmass Peak in the U.S. state of Colorado dominates the view from Snowmass Lake. It is often mistaken for Snowmass Mountain, the thirty-fourth highest mountain peak in the state, as well as for Hagerman Peak. Snowmass Peak is not really a peak but the lower end of Hagerman Peak's east ridge. Natural forced perspective causes the optical illusion that Snowmass Peak is higher than Hagerman Peak though it is actually 221 ft shorter than Hagerman's summit. This illusion combined with its striking rise behind Snowmass Lake justifies it being a named point on USGS topographical maps. It is located in the Elk Mountains, within the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness of the White River National Forest. It lies along the border between Pitkin and Gunnison counties, west of Aspen and southwest of the town of Snowmass Village.\n\n\n== Hiking/climbing ==\nThe route used to climb Snowmass Peak is the Trail Rider Pass trail to Hagerman Peak. This trail can be accessed by Snowmass Creek approach off Divide Road Snowmass Village or the Geneva Lake trail. It is possible to reach the summit by horse between Hagerman Peak and Snowmass Mountain, but is much more difficult.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Colorado mountain ranges\nList of Colorado mountain summits\nList of Colorado fourteeners\nList of Colorado 4000 meter prominent summits\nList of the most prominent summits of Colorado\n\nList of Colorado county high points\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

            "content": "Mohsen Subhi (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0635\u0628\u062d\u064a\u200e, also, Mohsen Subhi Khalil AbdelHamid Ataya) (October 4, 1963 \u2013 August 2, 2009) was a Palestinian composer of classical Arabic music and arranger of modern Palestinian music and folk song.\nA master oud player and percussionist, Subhi was born in Ramallah, Palestine on October 4, 1963, where he established himself as a young musician, composer, performer and teacher. He moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1997 and continued living and working in Palestine, the United States (Boston and San Francisco) and Jordan.\nMohsen composed, arranged, (re)interpreted and performed music for television, plays, films and live audiences. After receiving a grant to record his second classical Arabic music (instrumental) CD, Mohsen Subhi (also known as Abu Kinaan) died as a result of an unfortunate accident on August 2, 2009 in Ramallah. He was buried in Al-Bireh.\n\n\n== Education and training ==\n\nMohsen began teaching himself music at the age of seven, initially as a percussionist and later on adopting the Oud as his main instrument. Master oud player Hatem Al-Afghani was among Mohsen's early music teachers. In the United States, Mohsen attended classes at Berklee in Boston and the Longy School of Music (Cambridge, MA) where he continued developing his unique style.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nMohsen composed, arranged, (re)interpreted and performed music for educational purposes, television, plays, dance troupes, films and live audiences. His unique contributions to Arab classical music and Palestinian folkloric dance brought him wide recognition as a rising musician.\nHe also taught percussion and/or Oud to children and adults through institutions, schools and private lessons in Ramallah and Jerusalem (Palestine) as well as Boston (1997\u20131999) and later on, San Francisco (U.S.)\nAlthough best known as an Oud player, Mohsen also used the Buzuq, and was no less talented as a percussionist playing derbakeh (tabla), taar, mazhar (frame drum), and daf (tambourine) fusing Arab, Persian, Indian and African rhythms.\nRaseef al-Madeena\nMohsen Subhi played buzuk and percussion with the Ramallah-based group, Al-Rahhala including its 1988 \"Raseef al-Madeena\".\n\n\n== Later musical works ==\nZaghareed\nWhile serving as the Music Director of the Palestinian National Music and Dance Troupe (El Funoun) in Palestine, [1] Mohsen composed the music to their popular production \u201cZaghareed\u201d (also Zaghareet) Ululations in 1997. [2]. Mohsen's reinterpretation and rearrangement of traditional Palestinian folkloric wedding songs was choreographed and danced by the internationally recognized Palestinian dabkeh group, El Funoun Dance Troupe and performed starting 1997. Zaghareed could be best described as \"an artistic work that combined authenticity with originality, traditional raw material with more modernistic dance components, and finally a very Palestinian theme with attributes that carry a universal appeal.\".\nMawasem\nIn 2006, the Lebanon-based independent record label Incognito released Mohsen Subhi's instrumental, Mawasem [Seasons], the first compilation of his renowned composition of oud pieces, accompanied by bass, cello and piano (featuring Antoine Lammam - percussions). [3]. In Mawasem, explains Jihad Touma, \"Subhi starts in maqam, in a circle widening with revelation, proceeding to a point where, necessarily, commentary falls short.\" (translated from Arabic from the backcover of Mawasem). Touma continues,\n\nAnd then there is the passage... He proceeds with working the maqam, confounding it, subtly morphing its identity into hybrid, genuine forms, loading every sound with the pangs of yet unborn maqams... Breaks are not expected in the moments and the spaces they span. Breaks are expected in their reflections. The 'oud trembles, groans, lurches, longs... The 'oud listens to its echo. The echo of the 'oud infuses the horizon of the rhythm as homogenous column. And in the end, the maqam settles on the inevitability of its absence.\n\nCommenting on Mawasem, Rabih Z wrote in the June 2006 issue of Time Out Beirut:\n\nMohsen Subhi has a very personal way of playing the oud, due to his previous experience as a percussionist and his subtle assimilation of Indian, African and Mediterranean influences. The album has received popular and critical acclaim in Lebanon: It is difficult not to fall helplessly in love with Mohsen Subhi's bewitching album Mawasem. Subhi's masterful oud playing is akin to a mystical art, making this CD breathtaking listening. (Rabih Z, Time Out Beirut, June 2006).\n\n\n== Film scores ==\nMohsen composed and performed the original soundtrack for a number of films documenting Palestinian life and history. Examples of film scores by Mohsen include:\nThe Presence of Absence in the Ruins of Kafr Bir\u2019im by John Halaka (2007)[4]\nThe Imaginary Village by Sandy Tolan and Melissa Robbins (2004) [5] Melissa Robbins, co-producer (with Sandy Tolan) of \u201cThe Imaginary Village\u201d commented on working with Mohsen and the impact of his music on the documentary\n\nIt was also a thrill for me to work with an original score, by Palestinian-American musician Mohsen Subhi Abdelhamid--to have the extra tool and the extra challenge of music. At some point, the music began to feel like another voice in the piece, with its own message to shape and respect.\n\nThe Inner Tour by Raanan Alexandrowicz (2001). Mohsen (spelled Muhssein Abed Al Hamid in the credits) was one of three artists whose music is used throughout the documentary. He spent the three days in the bus with the group of Palestinians whose stories the documentary attempts to tell and can be seen throughout the movie, often playing his Oud. [6]\nAli wa ashabuhu [Ali and his Friends] by Sobhi Al-Zobaidi (2000) [7]\nHis music was used as additional tracks in other movies. Examples include:\nSalt of this Sea by Annemarie Jacir, (2008) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1090680/\nhttp://www.philistinefilms.org/salt_soundtrack.html\nThis Palestinian Life by Philip Rizk (2008) http://www.thispalestinianlife.org/Makingof.php\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nOn August 2, 2009 Mohsen Subhi died in Ramallah as a result of an unfortunate accident. Mohsen was buried in Al-Bireh (see the daily Al-Quds August 3 through 7th, 2009 and September 10, 2009). His latest (and last) classical Arabic music (instrumental) CD will be released in the near future. The October 2009 issue of This Week in Palestine \"shar[ed] words rushed by his untimely departure\" ([8] pp. 56\u201357)\n\n\"In the act of performance, Mohsen would wrap himself around the belly of his oud \u2013 holding on to it as much as holding it \u2013 close his eyes, and let handplectrum- fingers-string-nerves-fleshwood fuse into a continuum of vibrations, which entrances as it grips the listener in its resonance.\" (p.57).\n\nSee also [9]\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFor samples of Mohsen's music (from Mawasem), visit http://www.menhon.com/singers/albums/277/Mohsen_Subhi/\nFor a glimpse of Mohsen, see the trailer for \"The inner Tour\" where he says: \"Some people, they don't like their lives.

He was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Open Book programme \"British Gothic\" in October 2015.\nThe Loney has been reviewed in The Guardian and The Telegraph. It is set in the area of Morecambe Bay in north west England, described in the text as \"that strange nowhere between the Wyre and the Lune\". Hurley has said that the novel's two starting points were \"to write a kind of dark version of the Nativity [...] and exploring ideas of faith and belief\" and \"various wild, lonely places on the north west coast of Lancashire [...] a sense of imminent menace or dormant power lying just under the sand and the water\". It is the winner of the 2015 Costa Book Awards First Novel Award as well as the British Book Industry award for best debut fiction and book of the year.\nHurley has previously had two volumes of short stories published by the Lime Tree Press (Cages and Other Stories, 2006, ISBN 9781411699021, and The Unusual Death of Julie Christie and Other Stories, 2008, ISBN 9780955981401). He lives in Lancashire, where he teaches English literature and creative writing.\nHis second novel, Devil's Day, will be published on 19 October 2017 by John Murray (ISBN 978-1473619869) and Tartarus Press (ISBN 9781905784981)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"About the author: Andrew Michael Hurley\".

            "content": "Thomas William Osborne (born February 23, 1937) is a former American football player, coach, college athletics administrator, and politician from Nebraska. He served as head football coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers for 25 years, from 1973 to 1997. Osborne was one of the most successful coaches in American college football history, with a career record of 255\u201349\u20133, 13 conference championships, and three national championships. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1999. Osborne was later elected U.S. Representative from Nebraska's 3rd congressional district, as a Republican. He served three terms, from 2001 to 2007. In 2007, he returned to the University of Nebraska as athletic director (AD). He retired as AD in January 2013.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nMade and raised in Hastings, a small town in rural central Nebraska, Tom Osborne was a star athlete at Hastings High School in football and basketball, and won the state discus throw in track. As a senior in 1955, he was awarded the Nebraska High School Athlete of The Year by the Omaha World Herald. He then stayed in town to attend Hastings College, the same college his father and grandfather had attended. During his time at Hastings College, Osborne played football and basketball. He graduated with a B.A. in history in 1959, and was awarded the Nebraska College Athlete of the Year. Osborne was drafted into the National Football League (NFL) by the San Francisco 49ers, for whom he played one season as a wide receiver, before playing two seasons for the Washington Redskins.\nOsborne earned a M.A. in educational psychology from Nebraska in 1963 and a doctorate in educational psychology there in 1965. He also served in the Nebraska Army National Guard from 1960 to 1966.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nHe attended Hastings College, where his grandfather, class of 1901, and father, class of 1930, graduated. He was in the class of 1959, quarterbacked the football team and became the first male athlete in Nebraska to win both the high school (1955) and college (1959) athlete of the year awards by the Omaha World Herald. Osborne played three years of pro football as a wide receiver for Washington and San Francisco.\nSan Francisco 49ers\nTom Osborne began his NFL career in 1959 when the San Francisco 49ers drafted him in the 19th round of the 1959 NFL Draft in Philadelphia with the number 222nd pick. He was eventually released from the 49ers without playing in a regular season game.\nWashington Redskins\nThe Washington Redskins picked up Osborne in 1960. He made his debut on November 6 against the St. Louis Cardinals. Osborne had one reception for 8 yards, however it would be the team's third loss of the season, 44-6. In Tom's second career game, which took place on December 4 against Cleveland Browns, Osborne racked up 36 yards on 6 receptions, even so the Redskins went on to lose 27-16.\nOsborne saw more playing time in 1961, starting play in twelve games that year. His best was arguably on December 3 against the St. Louis Cardinals where he racked up 75 yard on 2 receptions both for 37.5 yards a reception. Osborne never made the playoffs as a player.\n\n\n== Coaching career ==\n\nIn 1964, Osborne joined the Cornhusker coaching staff as an unpaid offensive assistant to head coach Bob Devaney; his only compensation was being able to dine at the athletic training table. After two disappointing 6\u20134 seasons in 1967 and 1968, Devaney named Osborne as offensive coordinator for the 1969 season. Osborne immediately overhauled the offense, switching to a balanced attack operated from the I formation. The revamped offense sparked the 1970 Cornhuskers to the national title. The Huskers defeated LSU, 17\u201312, in the 1971 Orange Bowl and finished first in the post-bowl AP Poll, but third in the final UPI Coaches Poll. Through the 1973 season, the final UPI coaches poll was released before the bowls, making it a \"regular season\" title. The UPI awarded its title to Texas, which lost to Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl. Second-ranked Ohio State also lost, to Stanford in the Rose Bowl. Nebraska was 13\u20130 in 1971 and a consensus national champion, defeating the next three teams in the final AP Poll: Oklahoma, Colorado, and 1971 Alabama.\nDevaney announced he would step down as head coach at age 57 after the 1972 season to concentrate on his duties as athletic director, and named Osborne as his successor. Following a convincing win over Notre Dame in the 1973 Orange Bowl, Nebraska's third straight Orange Bowl victory, Osborne, age 35, took over as head coach. He was head coach for 25 seasons, through the 1997 season, serving for most of that time as his own offensive coordinator.\n\n\n=== Head coach at Nebraska ===\nIn his quarter-century as head coach, Osborne was a model of consistency. His teams never won fewer than nine games in a season, only finished worse than third in conference or division play once, finished in the top 15 of the final AP poll 24 years out of 25 (having finished 24th in 1990), and were ranked in every single weekly AP poll barring one week in 1977 and two in 1981. Osborne's teams won outright national championships in 1994 and 1995, and a share of another in 1997. Osborne's Huskers also won or shared 12 Big Eight Conference titles and one Big 12 Conference title. His 255\u201349\u20133 record gave him the best winning percentage (83.6%) among active NCAA Division I-A coaches at the time of his retirement and the fifth-best of all time. As of 2006, only Joe Paterno of Penn State has reached 200 victories in fewer games. But Osborne, who went on an NCAA record 60\u20133 run over his final five seasons, won 250 games faster than any coach in Division I-A history. Osborne finished his coaching career with a bowl record of 12\u201313.\nOsborne's teams were known for their powerful rushing attack and strong defense (also known as the Blackshirts\u2014referring to the black jerseys that are worn in practice by the defensive starters and certain selected special teams players). Nebraska led the nation in rushing several times in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the efforts of men like Jarvis Redwine, Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier, Calvin Jones, Ahman Green and Lawrence Phillips. After struggling to defend Oklahoma's wishbone option in the 1970s, Osborne switched from a balanced attack to a run-based option offense in 1980 in order to utilize the versatility of dual-threat quarterbacks, such as Jeff Quinn, Turner Gill, Tommie Frazier, and Scott Frost.\nEntering the 1984 Orange Bowl, the 1983 Cornhuskers were 12\u20130 and ranked #1 in the country for the entire season. Nebraska scored a late touchdown against the #5 ranked Miami Hurricanes to narrow the score to 31\u201330. Rather than attempt an extra point to tie, Osborne opted to attempt the two-point conversion and go for the win. However, Gill's pass attempt was tipped away in the end zone, giving hometown Miami the victory and the national championship.\nIn 1993, the Huskers again narrowly lost a national championship. Having gone into the 1994 Orange Bowl as a 17-point underdog to Florida State, Nebraska fought back from a 15\u20137 deficit to take a 16\u201315 lead with less than two minutes remaining in the Orange Bowl. After Florida State drove to retake the lead 18\u201316, Nebraska managed to hit a quick downfield pass in order to get one last field goal attempt as time ran out, which sailed wide. It was the last bowl game Osborne ever lost. The next year, however, Osborne earned his first title as head coach, defeating Miami in the 1995 Orange Bowl. The Huskers, who initially trailed, rallied to win 24\u201317. The next year, the Huskers roared through the regular season, stayed atop the rankings for all but one week, and crushed the Florida Gators, 62\u201324, in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl, earning Osborne his second national championship. The 1995 team was voted as the greatest college football team of all time in an ESPN poll. Osborne announced his retirement as head coach late in the 1997 season, selecting Frank Solich, his longtime running backs coach, to succeed him. In his final five seasons, Osborne's record was a staggering 60\u20133 (.952), at the time the strongest finale to any coaching career in NCAA football history and still a major-college record, though since surpassed by Larry Kehres' record of 72\u20133 (.960) in his final five seasons at Division III Mount Union from 2008 to 2012. His final game as head coach came in the 1998 Orange Bowl with a 42\u201317 victory over Tennessee, also the final NCAA game for Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning.\n\n\n=== Honors ===\nOsborne was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 2000, he received the Jim Thorpe Lifetime Achievement Award. In 1999, ESPN honored Osborne as the coach of the decade for the 1990s. In a 2007 online ESPN poll, Osborne was voted the \"greatest college football coach of all time\".\nIn 1998, Nebraska renamed the playing surface at Memorial Stadium Tom Osborne Field in Osborne's honor. The stadium had almost doubled in size during his three decades on the coaching staff, reflecting Nebraska's increased national prominence in that time.\n\n\n=== Coaching tree ===\nAssistant coaches under Tom Osborne who became NCAA head coaches:\nCraig Bohl: North Dakota State (2003\u20132013), Wyoming (2014\u2013present)\nTurner Gill: Buffalo (2006\u20132009), Kansas (2010\u20132011), Liberty (2012\u2013present)\nFrank Solich: Nebraska (1998\u20132003), Ohio (2005\u2013present)\nScott Frost (GA): UCF (2016\u20132017), Nebraska (2018-present)\nTony Samuel: New Mexico State (1997-2004) Southeast Missouri State (2006-2013)\nIt is worth noting that, while it may seem that few coaches from Osborne's staff became head coaches elsewhere, part of the success of the Nebraska Cornhusker football program under Coach Osborne was the consistency of the coaching staff. Assistant coaches within the Nebraska program stayed, often times despite having offers for head coaching positions at other schools. George Darlington (30 seasons), Milt Tenopir (29 seasons), and Charles McBride (23 seasons) are three examples of coaches who stayed at Nebraska under Osborne, despite having opportunities to go elsewhere to be head coaches. Darlington was the first assistant coach in Division I-A history to be involved in 300 wins at one school.\n\n\n=== Head coaching record ===\n\n\n== Athletic director career ==\nFrom 1979 to 1998, Osborne was assistant athletic director at Nebraska, first under Bob Devaney then under Bill Byrne.\nOsborne and the 1997 national championship team were the guests of honor at the Huskers' 2007 Homecoming game on October 13. Just two days after the resulting 45\u201314 loss to Oklahoma State \u2013 Nebraska's worst home loss since being shut out 31\u20130 by Missouri on November 1, 1958 \u2013 athletic director Steve Pederson was fired. On October 16, 2007, Osborne was announced as the interim athletic director, following Pederson's departure. On November 24, 2007, Osborne fired head coach Bill Callahan following a 5\u20137 season. Osborne appointed himself interim head coach so that he could perform recruiting duties while remaining in compliance with NCAA rules. He served as interim head coach for almost a week until naming Bo Pelini as head coach on December 2. In 2010, Osborne ended Nebraska's long-standing relationship with the Big 12 Conference and accepted an invitation for Nebraska to become the twelfth member of the Big Ten Conference.\nOn December 19, Nebraska removed the interim tag from Osborne's title and announced he would remain as athletic director through June 30, 2010. Osborne was paid $250,000 per year and managed Nebraska's 23-sport program. Osborne later agreed to continue as athletic director after 2010, with his position to be reviewed annually. On September 26, 2012, Osborne announced his retirement as athletic director, effective January 1, 2013. Osborne officially resigned on January 2, 2013, after returning to Lincoln with the Huskers football team following their participation in the Capital One Bowl.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== House of Representatives ===\nEarly in 2000, Osborne announced that he would run in Nebraska's 3rd District as a Republican. He had grown up in Hastings, one of the larger cities in the sprawling district, and claimed a home in Lemoyne, near Ogallala, as his district residence. However, he hadn't lived regularly in what is now the 3rd since at least 1964; for most of that time he'd lived in Lincoln, the heart of the 1st District. Nonetheless, due to his wide popularity in the state, he easily won the Republican primary, which was tantamount to election in what has long been one of the most Republican districts in the nation. He breezed to victory in November with 83 percent of the vote. He was reelected with no major-party opposition in 2002 and against an underfunded Democrat in 2004.\nIn Congress, Osborne's voting record was moderate to conservative. He garnered a lifetime rating of 83 from the American Conservative Union.\nAt one point, Osborne teamed up with Nebraska State Senator Ernie Chambers, normally his political adversary, to oppose efforts to expand gambling in Nebraska.\n\n\n=== 2006 governor's race ===\n\nIn 2006, Osborne ran for Governor of Nebraska, challenging Governor Dave Heineman and Omaha businessman Dave Nabity in the Republican primary.\nOsborne was initially thought to be the favorite in the race, given his tremendous popularity in the state. However, Heineman took 49 percent of the more than 197,000 votes cast while Osborne took 45 percent.\nThe Lincoln Journal Star analyzed the race:\n\nWhile Osborne captured populous Omaha and Lincoln, Heineman sealed his victory in rural counties and key population centers in western and central Nebraska\u2019s critical Republican battleground....\n...it was the political impact of two gubernatorial vetoes that appeared to lift [Heineman ] into a late surge, especially in Osborne\u2019s congressional district.\nHeineman\u2019s opposition to Class I rural school reorganization and the granting of resident college tuition rates to the children of illegal immigrants cut into Osborne\u2019s support.\nOsborne declined to sign referendum petitions seeking voter repeal of the rural school legislation and said he would have signed the resident tuition bill.\" [1]\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of college football coaches with 200 wins\nList of college football coaches with a .750 winning percentage\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nUnited States Congress. \"Tom Osborne (id: O000165)\".

Working later with Bernardo de Dominici, he became a follower of Franz Joachim Beich, and flourished as a landscape painter or vedutista, but died in his mid-thirties. He left di Dominici to work with Gaetano Martoriello. He is said to have died from Mercury treatment of venereal disease. It is unknown if he is a distant relation to Francesco Pagano, a painter of the 15th century in Naples.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMadrazo, Pedro de (1872).

            "content": "Capacitor discharge sintering (CDS)  is an electric current assisted sintering (ECAS) technique. The technique is based on storage of electromagnetic energy in a high voltage capacitor bank, and discharge into the sintering apparatus at low voltage (<30 V) and high current through step-down transformers on a pre-compacted powder compact which is kept under pressure. The sintering mould and Electrodes are similar to those employed in field assisted sintering techniques (FAST) such as spark plasma sintering and single electromagnetic pulse sintering technologies.\nThe method, analogous to resistive sintering, is a direct evolution of a welding technology named Capacitor Discharge Welding (Kondensator-Impulsschwei\u00dfen). CDS seems like an improvement of the less powerful capacitor discharge compaction patented by W.Knoess and M.Schlemmer (EP 0671232, US Patent 5529746).\nAdvantages of the technique are:\nshort sintering time (less than one second)\nno need for a controlled atmosphere even during sintering of highly reactive materials such as titanium\nthe ability to obtain metastable and nanocrystalline materials (see Capacitor discharge sintering of nanocrystalline copper)\n\n\n== Disambiguation ==\nThe technique has been studied by Element Six under the name of electro-discharge sintering. This name has been adopted by many authors in the past to describe a range of different technologies which typically adopt very high voltages and completely different machines. For this reason the technique which employs low voltages and high currents adapted from capacitor discharge welding has been named capacitor discharge sintering. Other authors also refer to this technology as spark plasma compaction (in reference to the well known Spark Plasma Sintering with whom it has in common only the use of electric currents).\n\n\n== Developments ==\nCapacitor discharge sintering is at an experimental/research stage of development in Germany at the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum where a prototype machine is installed.\nIndustrialization and evolution of the technology is ongoing in EPoS srl, a start-up company from Torino. EPoS has patented a CDS based process which is claimed to produce components with improved properties at a competitive production cost. The company active since 2010 is employing solely proprietary technologies based on CDS to develop and produce abrasives, cemented carbide blanks, and a wide range of components produced with metallic alloys, semiconductors and composites.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "A city is a large human settlement. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organizations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process.\nHistorically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanization, roughly half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas - creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centers for employment, entertainment, and edification. However, in a world of intensifying globalization, all cities are in different degree also connected globally beyond these regions.\nThe most populated city proper is Shanghai while the largest metropolitan areas also include the Greater Tokyo Area and Jabodetabek (Jakarta). The cities of Faiyum, Damascus, and Varanasi are among those laying claim to longest continual inhabitation.\n\n\n== Meaning ==\n\nA city is distinguished from other human settlements by its relatively great size, but also by its functions and its special symbolic status, which may be conferred by a central authority. The term can also refer either to the physical streets and buildings of the city or to the collection of people who dwell there, and can be used in a general sense to mean urban rather than rural territory.\nA variety of definitions, invoking population, population density, number of dwellings, economic function, and infrastructure, are used in national censuses to classify populations as urban. Common population definitions for a city range between 1,500 and 50,000 people, with most states using a minimum between 1,500 and 5000 inhabitants. However, some jurisdictions set no such minimums. In others, such as in the United Kingdom, city status is awarded on local criteria. According to the \"functional definition\" a city is not distinguished by size alone, but also by the role it plays within a larger political context. Cities serve as administrative, commercial, religious, and cultural hubs for their larger surrounding areas.\nThe presence of a literate elite is sometimes included in the definition. A typical city has professional administrators, regulations, and some form of taxation (food and other necessities or means to trade for them) to feed the government workers. (This arrangement contrasts with the more typically horizontal relationships in a tribe or village accomplishing common goals through informal agreements between neighbors, or through leadership of a chief.) The governments may be based on heredity, religion, military power, work projects such as canal building, food distribution, land ownership, agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, finance, or a combination of these. Societies that live in cities are often called civilizations.\nThe word city and the related civilization come, via Old French, from the Latin root civitas, originally meaning citizenship or community member and eventually coming to correspond with urbs, meaning city in a more physical sense. The Roman civitas was closely linked with the Greek \"polis\" \u2013 another common root appearing in English words such as metropolis.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nUrban geography deals both with cities in their larger context and with their internal structure.\n\n\n=== Site ===\nTown siting has varied through history according to natural, technological, economic, and military contexts. Access to water has long been a major factor in city placement and growth, and despite exceptions enabled by the advent of rail transport in the nineteenth century, through the present most of the world's urban population lives near the coast or on a river.\nUrban areas as a rule cannot produce their own food and therefore must develop some relationship with a hinterland which sustains them. Only in special cases such as mining towns which play a vital role in long-distance trade, are cities disconnected from the countryside which feeds them. Thus, centrality within a productive region influences siting, as economic forces would in theory favor the creation of market places in optimal mutually reachable locations.\n\n\n=== Center ===\n\nThe vast majority of cities have a central area containing buildings with special economic, political, and religious significance. Archaeologists refer to this area by the Greek term temenos or if fortified as a citadel. These spaces historically reflect and amplify the city's centrality and importance to its wider sphere of influence. Today cities have a city center or downtown, sometimes coincident with a central business district.\n\n\n=== Public space ===\nCities typically have public spaces where anyone can go. These include privately owned spaces open to the public as well as forms of public land such as public domain and the commons. Western philosophy since the time of the Greek agora has considered physical public space as the substrate of the symbolic public sphere. Public art adorns (or disfigures) public spaces. Parks and other natural sites within cities provide residents with relief from the hardness and regularity of typical built environments.\n\n\n=== Internal structure ===\nUrban structure generally follows one or more basic patterns: geomorphic, radial, concentric, rectilinear, and curvilinear. Physical environment generally constrains the form in which a city is built. If located on a mountainside, it may rely on terraces and winding roads. It may be adapted to its means of subsistence (e.g. agriculture or fishing). And it may be set up for optimal defense given the surrounding landscape. Beyond these \"geomorphic\" features, cities can develop internal patterns, due to natural growth or to city planning.\nIn a radial structure, main roads converge on a central point. This form could evolve from successive growth over a long time, with concentric traces of town walls and citadels marking older city boundaries. In more recent history, such forms were supplemented by ring roads moving traffic around the outskirts of a town. Dutch cities such as Amsterdam and Haarlem are structured as a central square surrounded by concentric canals marking every expansion. In cities such as and also Moscow, this pattern is still clearly visible.\nA system of rectilinear city streets and land plots, known as the grid plan, has been used for millennia in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The Indus Valley Civilisation built Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa and other cities on a grid pattern, using ancient principles described by Kautilya, and aligned with the compass points. The ancient Greek city of Priene exemplifies a grid plan with specialized districts used across the Hellenistic Mediterranean.\n\n\n=== Urban areas ===\nUrban-type settlement extends far beyond the traditional boundaries of the city proper in a form of development sometimes described critically as urban sprawl. Decentralization and dispersal of city functions (commercial, industrial, residential, cultural, political) has transformed the very meaning of the term and has challenged geographers seeking to classify territories according to an urban-rural binary.\nMetropolitan areas include suburbs and exurbs organized around the needs of commuters, and sometimes edge cities characterized by a degree of economic and political independence. (In the USA these are grouped into metropolitan statistical areas for purposes of demography and marketing.) Some cities are now part of a continuous urban landscape called urban agglomeration, conurbation, or megalopolis (exemplified by the BosWash corridor of the Northeastern United States.)\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCities, characterized by population density, symbolic function, and urban planning, have existed for thousands of years. In the conventional view, civilization and the city both followed from the development of agriculture, which enabled production of surplus food, and thus a social division of labour (with concomitant social stratification) and trade. Early cities often featured granaries, sometimes within a temple. A minority viewpoint considers that cities may have arisen without agriculture, due to alternate means of subsistence (fishing), to use as communal seasonal shelters, to their value as bases for defensive and offensive military organization, or to their inherent economic function. Cities played a crucial role in the establishment of political power over an area, and ancient leaders such as Alexander the Great founded and created them with zeal.\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\n\nJericho and \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, dated to the eighth millennium BC, are among the earliest proto-cities known to archaeologists.\nIn the fourth and third millennium BC, complex civilizations flourished in the river valleys of Mesopotamia, India, China, and Egypt. Excavations in these areas have found the ruins of cities geared variously towards trade, politics, or religion. Some had large, dense populations, but others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations. Among the early Old World cities, Mohenjo-daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in present-day Pakistan, existing from about 2600 BC, was one of the largest, with a population of 50,000 or more and a sophisticated sanitation system. China's planned cities were constructed according to sacred principles to act as celestial microcosms. The Ancient Egyptian cities known physically by archaeologists are not extensive. They include (known by their Arab names) El Lahun, a workers' town associated with the pyramid of Senusret II, and the religious city Amarna built by Akhenaten and abandoned. These sites appear planned in a highly regimented and stratified fashion, with a minimalistic grid of rooms for the workers and increasingly more elaborate housing available for higher classes.\nIn Mesopotamia, the civilization of Sumer, followed by Assyria and Babylon, gave rise to numerous cities, governed by kings and fostering multiple languages written in cuneiform. The Phoenician trading empire, flourishing around the turn of the first millennium BC, encompassed numerous cities extending from Tyre, Cydon, and Byblos to Carthage and C\u00e1diz.\nIn the following centuries, independent city-states of Greece developed the polis, an association of male landowning citizens who collectively constituted the city. The agora, meaning \"gathering place\" or \"assembly\", was the center of athletic, artistic, spiritual and political life of the polis. Rome's rise to power brought its population to one million. Under the authority of its empire, Rome transformed and founded many cities (coloniae), and with them brought its principles of urban architecture, design, and society.\nIn the ancient Americas, early urban traditions developed in the Andes and Mesoamerica. In the Andes, the first urban centers developed in the Norte Chico civilization, Chavin and Moche cultures, followed by major cities in the Huari, Chimu and Inca cultures. The Norte Chico civilization included as many as 30 major population centers in what is now the Norte Chico region of north-central coastal Peru. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas, flourishing between the 30th century BC and the 18th century BC. Mesoamerica saw the rise of early urbanism in several cultural regions, beginning with the Olmec and spreading to the Preclassic Maya, the Zapotec of Oaxaca, and Teotihuacan in central Mexico. Later cultures such as the Aztec drew on these earlier urban traditions.\nJenn\u00e9-Jeno, located in present-day Mali and dating to the third century BC, lacked monumental architecture and a distinctive elite social class\u2014but nevertheless had specialized production and relations with a hinterland. Pre-Arabic trade contacts probably existed between Jenn\u00e9-Jeno and North Africa. Other early urban centers in sub-Saharan Africa, dated to around 500 AD, include Awdaghust, Kumbi-Saleh the ancient capital of Ghana, and Maranda a center located on a trade route between Egypt and Gao.\nIn the first millennium AD, Angkor in the Khmer Empire grew into one of the most extensive cities in the world and may have supported up to one million people.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn the remnants of the Roman Empire, cities of late antiquity gained independence but soon lost population and importance. The locus of power in the West shifted to Constantinople and to the ascendant Islamic civilization with its major cities Baghdad, Cairo, and C\u00f3rdoba. From the 9th through the end of the 12th century, Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe, with a population approaching 1 million. The Ottoman Empire gradually gained control over many cities in the Mediterranean area, including Constantinople in 1453.\nBy the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, some cities become powerful states, taking surrounding areas under their control or establishing extensive maritime empires. In Italy medieval communes developed into city-states including the Republic of Venice and the Republic of Genoa. In Northern Europe, cities including L\u00fcbeck and Bruges formed the Hanseatic League for collective defense and commerce. Their power was later challenged and eclipsed by the Dutch commercial cities of Ghent, Ypres, and Amsterdam. Similar phenomena existed elsewhere, as in the case of Sakai, which enjoyed a considerable autonomy in late medieval Japan.\n\n\n=== Early modern ===\nIn the West, nation-states became the dominant unit of political organization following the Peace of Westphalia in the seventeenth century. Western Europe's larger capitals (London and Paris) benefited from the growth of commerce following the emergence of an Atlantic trade. However, most towns remained small.\nDuring the Spanish colonization of the Americas the old Roman city concept was extensively used. Cities were founded in the middle of the newly conquered territories, and were bound to several laws regarding administration, finances and urbanism.\n\n\n=== Industrial age ===\nThe growth of modern industry from the late 18th century onward led to massive urbanization and the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions, as new opportunities brought huge numbers of migrants from rural communities into urban areas.\n\nEngland led the way as London became the capital of a world empire and cities across the country grew in locations strategic for manufacturing. In the United States from 1860 to 1910, the introduction of railroads reduced transportation costs, and large manufacturing centers began to emerge, fueling migration from rural to city areas.\nIndustrialized cities became deadly places to live, due to health problems resulting from overcrowding, occupational hazards of industry, contaminated water and air, poor sanitation, and communicable diseases such as typhoid and cholera. Factories and slums emerged as regular features of the urban landscape.\n\n\n=== Post-industrial age ===\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, deindustrialization (or \"economic restructuring\") in the West led to poverty, homelessness, and urban decay in formerly prosperous cities. America's \"Steel Belt\" became a \"Rust Belt\" and cities such as Detroit, Michigan, and Gary, Indiana began to shrink, contrary to the global trend of massive urban expansion. Such cities have shifted with varying success into the service economy and public-private partnerships, with concomitant gentrification, uneven revitalization efforts, and selective cultural development. Under the Great Leap Forward and subsequent five-year plans continuing today, the People's Republic of China has undergone concomitant urbanization and industrialization and to become the world's leading manufacturer.\nAmidst these economic changes, high technology and instantaneous telecommunication enable select cities to become centers of the knowledge economy. A new smart city paradigm, supported by institutions such as the RAND Corporation and IBM, is bringing computerized surveillance, data analysis, and governance to bear on cities and city-dwellers. Some companies are building brand new masterplanned cities from scratch on greenfield sites.\n\n\n== Urbanization ==\n\nUrbanization is the process of migration from rural into urban areas, driven by various political, economic, and cultural factors. Until the 18th century, an equilibrium existed between the rural agricultural population and towns featuring markets and small-scale manufacturing. With the agricultural and industrial revolutions urban population began its unprecedented growth, both through migration and through demographic expansion. In England the proportion of the population living in cities jumped from 17% in 1801 to 72% in 1891. In 1900, 15% of the world population lived in cities. The cultural appeal of cities also plays a role in attracting residents.\nUrbanization rapidly spread across the Europe and the Americas and since the 1950s has taken hold in Asia and Africa as well. The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, reported in 2014 that for the first time more than half of the world population lives in cities.\n\nLatin America is the most urban continent, with four fifths of its population living in cities, including one fifth of the population said to live in shantytowns (favelas, villas miserias, etc.). Batam, Indonesia, Mogadishu, Somalia, Xiamen, China and Niamey, Niger, are considered among the world's fastest-growing cities, with annual growth rates of 5\u20138%. In general, the more developed countries of the \"Global North\" remain more urbanized than the less developed countries of the \"Global South\"\u2014but the difference continues to shrink because urbanization is happening faster in the latter group. Asia is home to by far the greatest absolute number of city-dwellers: over two billion and counting. The UN predicts an additional 2.5 billion citydwellers (and 300 million fewer countrydwellers) worldwide by 2050, with 90% of urban population expansion occurring in Asia and Africa.\nMegacities, cities with population in the multi-millions, have proliferated into the dozens, arising especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Economic globalization fuels the growth of these cities, as new torrents of foreign capital arrange for rapid industrialization, as well as relocation of major businesses from Europe and North America, attracting immigrants from near and far. A deep gulf divides rich and poor in these cities, with usually contain a super-wealthy elite living in gated communities and large masses of people living in substandard housing with inadequate infrastructure and otherwise poor conditions.\nCities around the world have expanded physically as they grow in population, with increases in their surface extent, with the creation of high-rise buildings for residential and commercial use, and with development underground.\nUrbanization can create rapid demand for water resources management, as formerly good sources of freshwater become overused and polluted, and the volume of sewage begins to exceed manageable levels.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nLocal government of cities takes different forms including prominently the municipality (especially in England, in the United States, in India, and in other British colonies; legally, the municipal corporation; municipio in Spain and in Portugal, and, along with municipalidad, in most former parts of the Spanish and Portuguese empires) and the commune (in France and in Chile; or comune in Italy).\nThe chief official of the city has the title of mayor. Whatever their true degree of political authority, the mayor typically acts as the figurehead or personification of their city.\n\nCity governments have authority to make laws governing activity within cities, while its jurisdiction is generally considered subordinate (in ascending order) to state/provincial, national, and perhaps international law. This hierarchy of law is not enforced rigidly in practice\u2014for example in conflicts between municipal regulations and national principles such as constitutional rights and property rights. Legal conflicts and issues arise more frequently in cities than elsewhere due to the bare fact of their greater density. Modern city governments thoroughly regulate everyday life in many dimensions, including public and personal health, transport, burial, resource use and extraction, recreation, and the nature and use of buildings. Technologies, techniques, and laws governing these areas\u2014developed in cities\u2014have become ubiquitous in many areas. Municipal officials may be appointed from a higher level of government or elected locally.\n\n\n=== Municipal services ===\n\nCities typically provide municipal services such as education, through school systems; policing, through police departments; and firefighting, through fire departments; as well as the city's basic infrastructure. These are provided more or less routinely, in a more or less equal fashion. Responsibility for administration usually falls on the city government, though some services may be operated by a higher level of government, while others may be privately run. Armies may assume responsibility for policing cities in states of domestic turmoil such as America's King assassination riots of 1968.\n\n\n=== Finance ===\nThe traditional basis for municipal finance is local property tax levied on real estate within the city. Local government can also collect revenue for services, or by leasing land that it owns. However, financing municipal services, as well as urban renewal and other development projects, is a perennial problem, which cities address through appeals to higher governments, arrangements with the private sector, and techniques such as privatization (selling services to into the private sector), corporatization (formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations), and financialization (packaging city assets into tradable financial instruments and derivatives). This situation has become acute in deindustrialized cities and in cases where businesses and wealthier citizens have moved outside of city limits and therefore beyond the reach of taxation. Cities in search of ready cash increasingly resort to the municipal bond, essentially a loan with interest and a repayment date. City governments have also begun to use tax increment financing, in which a development project is financed by loans based on future tax revenues which it is expected to yield. Under these circumstances, creditors and consequently city governments place a high importance on city credit ratings.\n\n\n=== Governance ===\nGovernance includes government but refers to a wider domain of social control functions implemented by many actors including nongovernmental organizations. The impact of globalization and the role of multinational corporations in local governments worldwide, has led to a shift in perspective on urban governance, away from the \"urban regime theory\" in which a coalition of local interests functionally govern, toward a theory of outside economic control, widely associated in academics with the philosophy of neoliberalism. In the neoliberal model of governance, public utilities are privatized, industry is deregulated, and corporations gain the status of governing actors\u2014as indicated by the power they wield in public-private partnerships and over business improvement districts, and in the expectation of self-regulation through corporate social responsibility. The biggest investors and real estate developers act as the city's de facto urban planners.\nThe related concept of good governance places more emphasis on the state, with the purpose of assessing urban governments for their suitability for development assistance. The concepts of governance and good governance are especially invoked in the emergent megacities, where international organizations consider existing governments inadequate for their large populations.\n\n\n=== Urban planning ===\n\nUrban planning, the application of forethought to city design, involves optimizing land use, transportation, utilities, and other basic systems, in order to achieve certain objectives. Urban planners and scholars have proposed overlapping theories as ideals for how plans should be formed. Planning tools, beyond the original design of the city itself, include public capital investment in infrastructure and land-use controls such as zoning. The continuous process of comprehensive planning involves identifying general objectives as well as collecting data to evaluate progress and inform future decisions.\nGovernment, as the ultimate wielder of force is legally the final authority on planning but in practice the process involves both public and private elements. The legal principle of eminent domain is used by government to divest citizens of their property in cases where its use is required for a project. Planning often involves tradeoffs\u2014decisions in which some stand to gain and some to lose\u2014and thus is closely connected to the prevailing political situation.\nThe history of urban planning dates to some of the earliest known cities, especially in the Indus Valley and Mesoamerican civilizations, which built their cities on grids and apparently zoned different areas for different purposes. The effects of planning, ubiquitous in today's world, can be seen most clearly in the layout of planned communities, fully designed prior to construction, often with consideration for interlocking physical, economic, and cultural systems.\n\n\n== Society ==\n\n\n=== Social structure ===\nUrban society is typically stratified. Spatially, cities are formally or informally segregated along ethnic, economic and racial lines. People living relatively close together may live, work, and play, in separate areas, and associate with different people, forming ethnic or lifestyle enclaves or, in areas of concentrated poverty, ghettoes. While in the USA and elsewhere poverty became associated with the inner city, in France it has become associated with the banlieues, areas of urban development which surround the city proper. Meanwhile, across Europe and North America, the racially white majority is empirically the most segregated group. Suburbs in the west, and, increasingly, gated communities and other forms of \"privatopia\" around the world, allow local elites to self-segregate into secure and exclusive neighborhoods.\nLandless urban workers, contrasted with peasants and known as the proletariat, form a growing stratum of society in the age of urbanization. In Marxist doctrine, the proletariat will inevitably revolt against the bourgeoisie as their ranks swell with disenfranchised and disaffected people lacking all stake in the status quo. The global urban proletariat of today, however, generally lacks the status as factory workers which in the nineteenth century provided access to the means of production.\n\n\n=== Economics ===\nHistorically, cities rely on rural areas for intensive farming to yield surplus crops, in exchange for which they provide money, political administration, manufactured goods, and culture. Urban economics tends to analyze larger agglomerations, stretching beyond city limits, in order to reach a more complete understanding of the local labor market.\n\nAs hubs of trade cities have long been home to retail commerce and consumption through the interface of shopping. In the 20th century, department stores using new techniques of advertising, public relations, decoration, and design, transformed urban shopping areas into fantasy worlds encouraging self-expression and escape through consumerism.\nIn general, the density of cities expedites commerce and facilitates knowledge spillovers, helping people and firms exchange information and generate new ideas. A thicker labor market allows for better skill matching between firms and individuals. Population density enables also sharing of common infrastructure and production facilities, however in very dense cities, increased crowding and waiting times may lead to some negative effects.\nAlthough manufacturing fueled the growth of cities, many now rely on a tertiary or service economy. The services in question range from tourism, hospitality, entertainment, housekeeping and prostitution to grey-collar work in law, finance, and administration.\n\n\n=== Culture and communications ===\nCities are typically hubs for education and the arts, supporting universities, museums, temples, and other cultural institutions. They feature impressive displays of architecture ranging from small to enormous and ornate to brutal; skyscrapers, providing thousands of offices or homes within a small footprint, and visible from miles away, have become iconic urban features. Cultural elites tend to live in cities, bound together by shared cultural capital, and themselves playing some role in governance. By virtue of their status as centers of culture and literacy, cities can be described as the locus of civilization, world history, and social change.\nDensity makes for effective mass communication and transmission of news, through heralds, printed proclamations, newspapers, and digital media. These communication networks, though still using cities as hubs, penetrate extensively into all populated areas. In the age of rapid communication and transportation, commentators have described urban culture as nearly ubiquitous or as no longer meaningful. At the same time hallmarks of rural life may appear in the midst of the city, as in the case of urban agriculture.\nToday, a city's promotion of its cultural activities dovetails with place branding and city marketing, public diplomacy techniques used to inform development strategy; to attract businesses, investors, residents, and tourists; and to create a shared identity and sense of place within the metropolitan area. Physical inscriptions, plaques, and monuments on display physically transmit a historical context for urban places. Some cities, such as Jerusalem, Mecca, and Rome have indelible religious status and for hundreds of years have attracted pilgrims. Patriotic tourists visit Agra to see the Taj Mahal, or New York City to visit the World Trade Center. Elvis lovers visit Memphis to pay their respects at Graceland. Place brands (which include place satisfaction and place loyalty) have great economic value (comparable to the value of commodity brands) because of their influence on the decision-making process of people thinking about doing business in\u2014\"purchasing\" (the brand of)\u2014a city.\nBread and circuses among other forms of cultural appeal, attract and entertain the masses. Sports also play a major role in city branding and local identity formation. Cities go to considerable lengths in competing to host the Olympic Games, which bring global attention and tourism.\n\n\n=== Warfare ===\n\nCities play a crucial strategic role in warfare due to their economic, demographic, symbolic, and political centrality. For the same reasons, they are targets in asymmetric warfare. Many cities throughout history were founded under military auspices, a great many have incorporated fortifications, and military principles continue to influence urban design. Indeed, war may have served as the social rationale and economic basis for the very earliest cities.\nPowers engaged in geopolitical conflict have established fortified settlements as part of military strategies, as in the case of garrison towns, America's Strategic Hamlet Program during the Vietnam War, and Israeli settlements in Palestine. While occupying the Philippines, the US Army ordered local people concentrated into cities and towns, in order to isolate committed insurgents and battle freely against them in the countryside.\nDuring World War II, national governments on occasion declared certain cities open, effectively surrendering them to an advancing enemy in order to avoid damage and bloodshed. Urban warfare proved decisive, however, in the Battle of Stalingrad, where Soviet forces repulsed German occupiers, with extreme casualties and destruction. In an era of low-intensity conflict and rapid urbanization, cities have become sites of long-term conflict waged both by foreign occupiers and by local governments against insurgency. Such warfare, known as counterinsurgency, involves techniques of surveillance and psychological warfare as well as close combat, functionally extends modern urban crime prevention, which already uses concepts such as defensible space.\nAlthough capture is the more common objective, warfare has in some cases spelt complete destruction for a city. Mesopotamian tablets and ruins attest to such destruction, as does the Latin motto Carthago delenda est. Since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and throughout the Cold War, nuclear strategists continued to contemplate the use of \"countervalue\" targeting: crippling an enemy by annihilating its valuable cities, rather than aiming primarily at its military forces.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nUrban infrastructure involves various physical networks and spaces necessary for transportation, water use, energy, recreation, and public functions. Infrastructure carries a high initial cost in fixed capital (pipes, wires, plants, vehicles, etc.) but lower marginal costs and thus positive economies of scale. Because of the higher barriers to entry, these networks have been classified as natural monopolies, meaning that economic logic favors control of each network by a single organization, public or private.\nInfrastructure in general (if not every infrastructure project) plays a vital role in a city's capacity for economic activity and expansion, underpinning the very survival of the city\u2019s inhabitants, as well as technological, commercial, industrial, and social activities. Structurally, many infrastructure systems take the form of networks with redundant links and multiple pathways, so that the system as a whole continue to operate even if parts of it fail. The particulars of a city\u2019s infrastructure systems have historical path dependence because new development must build from what exists already.\nMegaprojects such as the construction of airports, power plants, and railways require large upfront investments and thus tend to require funding from national government or the private sector. Privatization may also extend to all levels of infrastructure construction and maintenance.\nUrban infrastructure ideally serves all residents equally but in practice may prove uneven\u2014with, in some cities, clear first-class and second-class alternatives.\n\n\n=== Utilities ===\nPublic utilities (literally, useful things with general availability) include basic and essential infrastructure networks, chiefly concerned with the supply of water, electricity, and telecommunications capability to the populace.\nSanitation, necessary for good health in crowded conditions, requires water supply and waste management as well as individual hygiene. Urban water systems include principally a water supply network and a network for wastewater including sewage and stormwater. Historically, either local governments or private companies have administered urban water supply, with a tendency toward government water supply in the 20th century and a tendency toward private operation at the turn of the twenty-first. The market for private water services is dominated by two French companies, Veolia Water (formerly Vivendi) and Engie (formerly Suez), said to hold 70% of all water contracts worldwide.\nModern urban life relies heavily on the energy transmitted through electricity for the operation of electric machines (from household appliances to industrial machines to now-ubiquitous electronic systems used in communications, business, and government) and for traffic lights, streetlights and indoor lighting. Cities rely to a lesser extent on hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and natural gas for transportation, heating, and cooking. Telecommunications infrastructure such as telephone lines and coaxial cables also traverse cities, forming dense networks for mass and point-to-point communications.\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nBecause cities rely on specialization and an economic system based on wage labour, their inhabitants must have the ability to regularly travel between home, work, commerce, and entertainment. Citydwellers travel foot or by wheel on roads and walkways, or use special rapid transit systems based on underground, overground, and elevated rail. Cities also rely on long-distance transportation (truck, rail, and airplane) for economic connections with other cities and rural areas.\n\nHistorically, city streets were the domain of horses and their riders and pedestrians, who only sometimes had sidewalks and special walking areas reserved for them. In the west, bicycles or (velocipedes), efficient human-powered machines for short- and medium-distance travel, enjoyed a period of popularity at the beginning of the twentieth century before the rise of automobiles. Soon after, they gained a more lasting foothold in Asian and African cities under European influence. In western cities, industrializing, expanding, and electrifying at this time, public transit systems and especially streetcars enabled urban expansion as new residential neighborhoods sprung up along transit lines and workers rode to and from work downtown.\nSince the mid-twentieth century, cities have relied heavily on motor vehicle transportation, with major implications for their layout, environment, and aesthetics. (This transformation occurred most dramatically in the USA\u2014where corporate and governmental policies favored automobile transport systems\u2014and to a lesser extent in Europe.) The rise of personal cars accompanied the expansion of urban economic areas into much larger metropolises, subsequently creating ubiquitous traffic issues with accompanying construction of new highways, wider streets, and alternative walkways for pedestrians.\n\nHowever, severe traffic jams still occur regularly in cities around the world, as private car ownership and urbanization continue to increase, overwhelming existing urban street networks.\n\nThe urban bus system, the world's most common form of public transport, uses a network of scheduled routes to move people through the city, alongside cars, on the roads. Economic function itself also became more decentralized as concentration became impractical and employers relocated to more car-friendly locations (including edge cities). Some cities have introduced bus rapid transit systems which include exclusive bus lanes and other methods for prioritizing bus traffic over private cars. Many big American cities still operate conventional public transit by rail, as exemplified by the ever-popular New York City Subway system. Rapid transit is widely used in Europe and has increased in Latin America and Asia.\nWalking and cycling (\"non-motorized transport\") enjoy increasing favor (more pedestrian zones and bike lanes) in American and Asian urban transportation planning, under the influence of such trends as the Healthy Cities movement, the drive for sustainable development, and the idea of a carfree city. Techniques such as road space rationing and road use charges have been introduced to limit urban car traffic.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\nHousing of residents presents one of the major challenges every city must face. Adequate housing entails not only physical shelters but also the physical systems necessary to sustain life and economic activity. Home ownership represents status and a modicum of economic security, compared to renting which may consume much of the income of low-wage urban workers. Homelessness, or lack of housing, is a challenged currently faced by millions of people in countries rich and poor.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nUrban ecosystems, influenced as they are by the density of human buildings and activities differ considerably from those of their rural surroundings. Anthropogenic buildings and waste, as well as cultivation in gardens, create physical and chemical environments which have no equivalents in wilderness, in some cases enabling exceptional biodiversity. They provide homes not only for immigrant humans but also for immigrant plants, bringing about interactions between species which never previously encountered each other. They introduce frequent disturbances (construction, walking) to plant and animal habitats, creating opportunities for recolonization and thus favoring young ecosystems with r-selected species dominant. On the whole, urban ecosystems are less complex and productive than others, due to the diminished absolute amount of biological interactions.\nTypical urban fauna include insects (especially ants), rodents (mice, rats), and birds, as well as cats and dogs (domesticated and feral). Large predators are scarce.\n\nCities generate considerable ecological footprints, locally and at longer distances, due to concentrated populations and technological activities. From one perspective, cities are not ecologically sustainable due to their resource needs. From another, proper management may be able to ameliorate a city's ill effects. Air pollution arises from various forms of combustion, including fireplaces, wood or coal-burning stoves, other heating systems, and internal combustion engines. Industrialized cities, and today third-world megacities, are notorious for veils of smog (industrial haze) which envelop them, posing a chronic threat to the health of their millions of inhabitants. Urban soil contains higher concentrations of heavy metals (especially lead, copper, and nickel) and has lower pH than soil in comparable wilderness.\nModern cities are known for creating their own microclimates, due to concrete, asphalt, and other artificial surfaces, which heat up in sunlight and channel rainwater into underground ducts. The temperature in New York City exceeds nearby rural temperatures by an average of 2\u20133 \u00b0C and at times 5\u201310 \u00b0C differences have been recorded. This effect varies nonlinearly with population changes (independently of the city's physical size). Aerial particulates increase rainfall by 5\u201310%. Thus, urban areas experience unique climates, with earlier flowering and later leaf dropping than in nearby country.\nPoor and working-class people face disproportionate exposure to environmental risks (known as environmental racism when intersecting also with racial segregation). For example, within the urban microclimate, less-vegetated poor neighborhoods bear more of the heat (but have fewer means of coping with it).\n\n\n== World city system ==\nAs the world becomes more closely linked through economics, politics, technology, and culture (a process called globalization), cities have come to play a leading role in transnational affairs, exceeding the limitations of international relations conducted by national governments. This phenomenon, resurgent today, can be traced back to the Silk Road, Phoenicia, and the Greek city-states, through the Hanseatic League and other alliances of cities. Today the information economy based on high-speed internet infrastructure enables instantaneous telecommunication around the world, effectively eliminating the distance between cities for the purposes of stock markets and other high-level elements of the world economy, as well as personal communications and mass media.\n\n\n=== Global city ===\n\nA global city, also known as a world city, is a prominent centre of trade, banking, finance, innovation, and markets. Saskia Sassen used the term \"global city\" in 1991 to refer to a city's power, status, and cosmopolitanism, rather than to its size. Following this view of cities, it is possible to rank the world's cities hierarchically. London, New York City, Paris, and Tokyo form the capstone of the global hierarchy, exerting command and control through their economic and political influence. Global cities may have reached their status due to early transition to post-industrialism or through inertia which has enabled them to maintain their dominance from the industrial era. This type of ranking exemplifies an emerging discourse in which cities, considered variations on the same ideal type, must compete with each other globally to achieve prosperity.\nCritics of the notion point to the different realms of power and interchange. The term \"global city\" is heavily influenced by economic factors and, thus, may not account for places that are otherwise significant. Paul James, for example argues that the term is \"reductive and skewed\" in its focus on financial systems.\nMultinational corporations and banks make their headquarters in global cities and conduct much of their business within this context. American firms dominate the international markets for law and engineering and maintain branches in the biggest foreign global cities.\nGlobal cities feature concentrations of extremely wealthy and extremely poor people. Their economies are lubricated by their capacity (limited by the national government's immigration policy, which functionally defines the supply side of the labor market) to recruit low- and high-skilled immigrant workers from poorer areas. More and more cities today draw on this globally available labor force.\n\n\n=== Transnational activity ===\nCities increasingly participate in world political activities independently of their enclosing nation-states. Early examples of this phenomenon are the sister city relationship and the promotion of multi-level governance within the European Union as a technique for European integration. Cities including Hamburg, Prague, Amsterdam, The Hague, and City of London maintain their own embassies to the European Union at Brussels.\nNew urban dwellers may increasingly not simply as immigrants but as transmigrants, keeping one foot each (through telecommunications if not travel) in their old and their new homes.\n\n\n=== Global governance ===\nCities participate in global governance by various means including membership in global networks which transmit norms and regulations. At the general, global level, United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) is a significant umbrella organization for cities; regionally and nationally, Eurocities, Asian Network of Major Cities 21, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities the National League of Cities, and the United States Conference of Mayors play similar roles. UCLG took responsibility for creating Agenda 21 for culture, a program for cultural policies promoting sustainable development, and has organized various conferences and reports for its furtherance.\nNetworks have become especially prevalent in the arena of environmentalism and specifically climate change following the adoption of Agenda 21. Environmental city networks include the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, World Association of Major Metropolises (\"Metropolis\"), the United Nations Global Compact Cities Programme, the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (CNCA), the Covenant of Mayors and the Compact of Mayors, ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability, and the Transition Towns network.\nCities with world political status as meeting places for advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations, lobbyists, educational institutions, intelligence agencies, military contractors, information technology firms, and other groups with a stake in world policymaking. They are consequently also sites for symbolic protest.\n\n\n=== United Nations System ===\nThe United Nations System has been involved in a series of events and declarations dealing with the development of cities during this period of rapid urbanization.\nThe Habitat I conference in 1976 adopted the \"Vancouver Declaration on Human Settlements\" which identifies urban management as a fundamental aspect of development and establishes various principles for maintaining urban habitats.\nCiting the Vancouver Declaration, the UN General Assembly in December 1977 authorized the United Nations Commission Human Settlements and the HABITAT Centre for Human Settlements, intended to coordinate UN activities related to housing and settlements.\nThe 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro resulted in a set of international agreements including Agenda 21 which establishes principles and plans for sustainable development.\n\nThe Habitat II conference in 1996 called for cities to play a leading role in this program, which subsequently advanced the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals.\nIn January 2002 the UN Commission on Human Settlements became an umbrella agency called the United Nations Human Settlements Programme or UN-Habitat, a member of the United Nations Development Group.\nThe Habitat III conference of 2016 focused on implementing these goals under the banner of a \"New Urban Agenda\". The four mechanisms envisio 14ned for effecting the New Urban Agenda are (1) national policies promoting integrated sustainable development, (2) stronger urban governance, (3) long-term integrated urban and territorial planning, and (4) effective financing frameworks. Just before this conference, the European Union concurrently approved an \"Urban Agenda for the European Union\" known as the Pact of Amsterdam.\nUN-Habitat coordinates the UN urban agenda, working with the UN Environmental Programme, the UN Development Programme, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank.\n\nThe World Bank, a United Nations specialized agency, has been a primary force in promoting the Habitat conferences, and since the first Habitat conference has used their declarations as a framework for issuing loans for urban infrastructure. The bank's structural adjustment programs contributed to urbanization in the Third World by creating incentives to move to cities. The World Bank and UN-Habitat in 1999 jointly established the Cities Alliance (based at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C.) to guide policymaking, knowledge sharing, and grant distribution around the issue of urban poverty. (UN-Habitat plays an advisory role in evaluating the quality of a locality's governance.) The Bank's policies have tended to focus on bolstering real estate markets through credit and technical assistance.\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO has increasingly focused on cities as key sites for influencing cultural governance. It has developed various city networks including the International Coalition of Cities against Racism and the Creative Cities Network. UNESCO's capacity to select World Heritage Sites and maintain them through Public/social/private partnerships gives the organization significant influence over cultural capital, tourism, and historic preservation funding.\n\n\n== Representation in culture ==\n\nCities figure prominently in traditional Western culture, appearing in the Bible in both evil and holy forms, symbolized by Babylon and Jerusalem. Cain and Nimrod are the first city builders in the Book of Genesis. In Sumerian mythology Gilgamesh built the walls of Uruk.\nCities can be perceived in terms of extremes or opposites: at once liberating and oppressive, wealthy and poor, organized and chaotic. The name anti-urbanism refers to various types of ideological opposition to cities, whether because of their culture or their political relationship with the country. Such opposition may result from identification of cities with oppression and the ruling elite. This and other political ideologies strongly influence narratives and themes in discourse about cities. In turn, cities symbolize their home societies.\nWriters, painters, and filmmakers have produced innumerable works of art concerning the urban experience. Classical and medieval literature includes a genre of descriptiones which treat of city features and history. Modern authors such as Charles Dickens and James Joyce are famous for evocative descriptions of their home cities. Fritz Lang conceived the idea for his influential 1927 film Metropolis while visiting Times Square and marveling at the nighttime neon lighting. Other early cinematic representations of cities in the twentieth century generally depicted them as technologically efficient spaces with smoothly functioning systems of automobile transport. By the 1960s, however, traffic congestion began to appear in such films as The Fast Lady (1962) and Playtime (1967).\nLiterature, film, and other forms of popular culture have supplied visions of future cities both utopian and dystopian. The prospect of expanding, communicating, and increasingly interdependent world cities has given rise to images such as Nylonkong (NY, London, Hong Kong) and visions of a single world-encompassing ecumenopolis.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\nAbrahamson, Mark (2004).

            "content": "Charles-Genevi\u00e8ve-Louis-Auguste-Andr\u00e9-Timoth\u00e9e d'\u00c9on de Beaumont (5 October 1728 \u2013 21 May 1810), usually known as the Chevalier d'\u00c9on, was a French diplomat, spy, freemason and soldier who fought in the Seven Years' War. D'\u00c9on had androgynous physical characteristics and natural abilities as a mimic, good features for a spy. D'\u00c9on appeared publicly as a man and pursued masculine occupations for 49 years, although during that time d'\u00c9on successfully infiltrated the court of Empress Elizabeth of Russia by presenting as a woman. For 33 years, from 1777, d'\u00c9on dressed as a woman, identifying as female. Doctors who examined d'\u00c9on's body after death discovered \"male organs in every respect perfectly formed\", but also feminine characteristics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\n\nD'\u00c9on was born at the H\u00f4tel d'Uz\u00e8s in Tonnerre, Burgundy, into a poor noble family. D'\u00c9on's father, Louis d'\u00c9on de Beaumont, was an attorney and director of the king's dominions, later mayor of Tonnerre and sub-delegate of the intendant of the g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 of Paris. D'\u00c9on's mother, Fran\u00e7oise de Charanton, was the daughter of a Commissioner General to the armies of the wars of Spain and Italy. Most of what is known about d'\u00c9on's early life comes from a partly ghost-written autobiography, The Interests of the Chevalier d'\u00c9on de Beaumont.\nD'\u00c9on excelled in school, moving from Tonnerre to Paris in 1743, graduating in civil law and canon law from the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin in 1749 at age 21. D'\u00c9on became secretary to Bertier de Sauvigny, intendant of Paris, served as a secretary to the administrator of the fiscal department, and was appointed a royal censor for history and literature by Malesherbes in 1758.\n\n\n== Life as a spy ==\nIn 1756, d'\u00c9on joined the secret network of spies called the Secret du Roi (King's Secret) employed by King Louis XV without the knowledge of the government. It sometimes promoted policies that contradicted official policies and treaties. According to d'\u00c9on's memoirs (although there is no documentary evidence to support that account) the monarch sent d'\u00c9on with the Chevalier Douglas, Alexandre-Pierre de Mackensie-Douglas, baron de Kildin, a Scottish Jacobite in French service, on a secret mission to Russia in order to meet Empress Elizabeth and conspire with the pro-French faction against the Habsburg monarchy. At that time the English and French were at odds, and the English were attempting to deny the French access to the Empress by allowing only women and children to cross the border into Russia. D'\u00c9on had to pass convincingly as a woman or risk being executed by the English upon discovery. In the course of this mission, d'\u00c9on was disguised as the lady Lea de Beaumont, and served as a maid of honour to the Empress. Eventually, Chevalier Douglas became French ambassador to Russia, and d'\u00c9on was secretary to the embassy in Saint Petersburg from 1756 to 1760, serving Douglas and his successor, the marquis de l'H\u00f4pital. D'\u00c9on's career in Russia is the subject of one of Valentin Pikul's novels, Le chevalier d'\u00c9on et la guerre de Sept ans (\u00ab\u041f\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0448\u043f\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439\u00bb).\nD'\u00c9on returned to France in October 1760, and was granted a pension of 2,000 livres as reward for service in Russia. In May 1761, d'\u00c9on became a captain of dragoons under the mar\u00e9chal de Broglie and fought in the later stages of the Seven Years' War. D'\u00c9on served at the Battle of Villinghausen in July 1761, and was wounded at Ultrop. After Empress Elizabeth died in January 1762, d'\u00c9on was considered for further service in Russia, but instead was appointed secretary to the duc de Nivernais, awarded 1,000 livres, and sent to London to draft the peace treaty that formally ended the Seven Years' War. The treaty was signed in Paris on 10 February 1763, and d'\u00c9on was awarded a further 6,000 livres, and received the Order of Saint-Louis on 30 March 1763, becoming the Chevalier d'\u00c9on. The title chevalier, French for knight, is also sometimes used for French noblemen.\nBack in London, d'\u00c9on became charg\u00e9 d'affaires in April 1763, and then plenipotentiary minister \u2013 essentially interim ambassador \u2013 when the duc de Nivernais returned to Paris in July. D'\u00c9on used this position also to spy for the king. D'\u00c9on collected information for a potential invasion \u2013 an unfortunate and clumsy initiative of Louis XV, of which Louis's own ministers were unaware \u2013 assisting a French agent, Louis Fran\u00e7ois Carlet de la Rozi\u00e8re, who was surveying the British coastal defences. D'\u00c9on formed connections with English nobility by sending them the produce of d'\u00c9on's vineyard in France; d'\u00c9on abundantly enjoyed the splendour of this interim embassy.\nUpon the arrival of the new ambassador, the comte de Guerchy in October 1763, d'\u00c9on was demoted to the rank of secretary and humiliated by the count. D'\u00c9on was trapped between two French factions: Guerchy was a supporter of the duc de Choiseul, duc de Praslin and Madame de Pompadour, in opposition to the comte de Broglie and his brother the mar\u00e9chal de Broglie. D'\u00c9on complained, and eventually decided to disobey orders to return to France. In a letter to the king, d'\u00c9on claimed that the new ambassador had tried to drug d'\u00c9on at a dinner at the ambassador's residence in Monmouth House in Soho Square. The British government declined a French request to extradite d'\u00c9on, and the 2,000 livres pension that had been granted in 1760 was stopped in February 1764. In an effort to save d'\u00c9on's station in London, d'\u00c9on published much of the secret diplomatic correspondence about d'\u00c9on's recall under the title Lettres, m\u00e9moires et n\u00e9gociations particuli\u00e8res du chevalier d'\u00c9on in March 1764, disavowing Guerchy and calling him unfit for his job. This breach of diplomatic discretion was scandalous to the point of being unheard of, but d'\u00c9on had not yet published everything (the King's secret invasion documents and those relative to the Secret du Roi were kept back as \"insurance\"), and the French government became very cautious in its dealings with d'\u00c9on, even when d'\u00c9on sued Guerchy for attempted murder. With the invasion documents in hand, d'\u00c9on held the king in check. D'\u00c9on did not offer any defense when Guerchy sued for libel, and d'\u00c9on was declared an outlaw and went into hiding. However, d'\u00c9on secured the sympathy of the British public: the mob jeered Guerchy in public, and threw stones at his residence. D'\u00c9on then wrote a book on public administration, Les loisirs du Chevalier d'\u00c9on, which was published in thirteen volumes in Amsterdam in 1774.\nGuerchy was recalled to France, and in July 1766 Louis XV granted d'\u00c9on a pension (possibly a pay-off for d'\u00c9on's silence) and a 12,000-livre annuity, but refused a demand for over 100,000 livres to clear d'\u00c9on's extensive debts. D'\u00c9on continued to work as a spy, but lived in political exile in London. D'\u00c9on's possession of the king's secret letters provided protection against further actions, but d'\u00c9on could not return to France.\n\n\n== Life as a woman ==\n\nDespite the fact that d'\u00c9on habitually wore a dragoon's uniform, rumours circulated in London that d'\u00c9on was actually a woman. A betting pool was started on the London Stock Exchange about d'\u00c9on's true sex. D'\u00c9on was invited to join, but declined, saying that an examination would be dishonouring, whatever the result. After a year without progress, the wager was abandoned. Following the death of Louis XV in 1774, the secret du roi was abolished, and d'\u00c9on tried to negotiate a return from exile. The writer Pierre de Beaumarchais represented the French government in the negotiations. The resulting twenty-page treaty permitted d'\u00c9on to return to France and retain the ministerial pension, but required that d'\u00c9on turn over the correspondence regarding the secret du roi.\nMadame Campan writes in her memoirs: \"This eccentric being had long solicited permission to return to France; but it was necessary to find a way of sparing the family he had offended the insult they would see in his return; he was therefore made to resume the costume of that sex to which in France everything is pardoned. The desire to see his native land once more determined him to submit to the condition, but he revenged himself by combining the long train of his gown and the three deep ruffles on his sleeves with the attitude and conversation of a grenadier, which made him very disagreeable company.\"\nThe Chevalier d'\u00c9on claimed to have been assigned female at birth, and demanded recognition by the government as such. D'\u00c9on claimed to have been raised as a boy because Louis d'\u00c9on de Beaumont could only inherit from his in-laws if he had a son. King Louis XVI and his court complied with this demand, but required in turn that d'\u00c9on dress appropriately in women's clothing, although d'\u00c9on was allowed to continue to wear the insignia of the Order of Saint-Louis. When the king's offer included funds for a new wardrobe of women's clothes, d'\u00c9on agreed. In 1777, after fourteen months of negotiation, d'\u00c9on returned to France and as punishment was banished to Tonnerre.\n\nWhen France began to help the rebels during the American War of Independence, d'\u00c9on asked to join the French troops in America, but d'\u00c9on's banishment prevented it. In 1779, d'\u00c9on published a book of memoirs: La Vie Militaire, politique, et priv\u00e9e de Mademoiselle d'\u00c9on. They were ghostwritten by a friend named La Fortelle and are probably embellished. D'\u00c9on was allowed to return to England in 1785.\nThe pension that Louis XV had granted was ended by the French Revolution, and d'\u00c9on had to sell personal possessions, including books, jewellery and plate. The family's properties in Tonnerre were confiscated by the revolutionary government. In 1792, d'\u00c9on sent a letter to the French National Assembly offering to lead a division of female soldiers against the Habsburgs, but the offer was rebuffed. D'\u00c9on participated in fencing tournaments until seriously wounded in Southampton in 1796. D'\u00c9on's last years were spent with a widow, Mrs. Cole. In 1804, d'\u00c9on was sent to a debtors' prison for five months, and signed a contract for a biography to be written by Thomas William Plummer, which was never published. D'\u00c9on became paralyzed following a fall, and spent a final four years bedridden, dying in poverty in London on 21 May 1810 at the age of 81.\nThe surgeon who examined d'\u00c9on's body attested in their post-mortem certificate, that the Chevalier had \"male organs in every respect perfectly formed,\" while at the same time displaying feminine characteristics. A couple of characteristics described in the certificate were \"unusual roundness in the formation of limbs,\" as well as \"breast remarkably full.\" D'\u00c9on's body was buried in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church, and d'\u00c9on's remaining possessions were sold by Christie's in 1813. D'\u00c9on's grave is listed on the Burdett-Coutts Memorial there as one of the important graves lost.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nSome of d'\u00c9on's papers are at the Brotherton Library in Leeds, England.\nHavelock Ellis coined the term eonism to describe similar cases of transgender behavior; it is rarely used now. The Beaumont Society, a long-standing organisation for transgender people, is named after d'\u00c9on.\nIn 2012, a painting owned by the Philip Mould Gallery was identified as a portrait of d'\u00c9on and purchased by the National Portrait Gallery, London.\nThe Burdett-Coutts Memorial at St Pancras Gardens in London commemorates d'\u00c9on as well as other people; in 2016 Historic England upgraded it to Grade II*.\n\n\n=== Cultural depictions ===\nThe Chevalier d'\u00c9on has appeared as a character in numerous fictional works over the years.\nThe Chevali\u00e8re d'Eon, by Charles Dupeuty and the Baron de Maldigny (1837), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville\nThe Chevalier d'Eon, a comedy in three acts by Dumanoir and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bayard (1837), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s\nLe chevalier d'Eon, op\u00e9ra-comique in four acts by Rodolphe Berger, libretto by Armand Silvestre and Henri Cain (1908), Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin; Mlle.

In some in-game depictions is shown wearing an outfit supposedly gifted by Marie Antoinette herself.\nSword of the Chevalier by Guy Adams, a Doctor Who audio drama by Big Finish Productions, starring David Tennant and Billie Piper as the Tenth Doctor and Rose Tyler; released in November 2017, it features the Doctor and Rose working with the Chevalier to stop a twisted alien slave trader destroying the human race to make their newly-acquired slaves increase in value on the market.\nD'Eon by Renny Krupinski, will premiere at Hope Mill Theatre in Manchester in February 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDecker, Michel de.

Two high-profile missing persons are Robert 'Bobby' Tennison, a 38-year-old father of four, missing since January 2009 and Garret Rodriquez, a 29-year-old from San Diego, California, who was reported missing on April 25, 2013 by his father. In their last conversation in December 2012, Mr. Rodriguez told his father he was headed to \"Murder Mountain\" to work on a marijuana grow. After he went missing, his truck was found in June 2013. On December 1, 2013 human remains were found in a grave on a private property on Jewitt Ranch Road, one day after private investigators received an anonymous tip to the exact location of a grave believed to be Rodriquez's. On December 17, the remains were identified as Rodriquez and he was confirmed a victim of a homicide. It is suspected that the anonymous tip came from a confession extracted from the man responsible for the murder, who gave up the information after being kidnapped, shot twice and threatened by a group of eight local vigilantes on Thanksgiving Day.\nAcross the valley from Rancho Sequoia on Pratt Mountain, 24-year-old Dirk Dickenson was shot in the back by a federal agent during a military-style federal raid which arrived at his property by helicopter. Dickenson was found blameless by a Federal Department of Justice investigation; charges against his killer were moved to federal court and ultimately dismissed. He was posthumously on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine and is recognized as the first victim of the U.S. war on drugs.\n\n\n== See also ==\n California portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Additional reading ==\nEszterhas, Joe, Death in the Wilderness: The Justice Department's Killer Nark Strike Force, Rolling Stone Magazine, Number 135, May 24, 1973\nRobbins, William, The Talk Of Alderpoint; In a Coast Mountain fastness, peace (and Police helicopters), The New York Times, August 16, 1985, accessed June 28, 2013.",

            "content": "Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) is an aviation flight category that describes weather conditions that require pilots to fly primarily by reference to instruments, and therefore under instrument flight rules (IFR), rather than by outside visual references under visual flight rules (VFR). Typically, this means flying in cloudy or bad weather. Pilots sometimes train to fly in these conditions with the aid of products like Foggles, specialized glasses that restrict outside vision, forcing the student to rely on instrument indications only.\nThe weather conditions required for flight under VFR are known as visual meteorological conditions (VMC). IMC and VMC are mutually exclusive. In fact, instrument meteorological conditions are defined as less than the minima specified for visual meteorological conditions. The boundary criteria between VMC and IMC are known as the VMC minima. There is also a concept of \"marginal VMC\", which are certain conditions above VMC minima, which are fairly close to one or more of the VMC minima.\nWith good visibility, pilots can determine the aircraft attitude by utilising visual cues from outside the aircraft, most significantly the horizon. Without such external visual cues, pilots must use an internal source of the attitude information, which is usually provided by gyroscopically-driven instruments such as the attitude indicator (\"artificial horizon\"). The availability of a good horizon cue is controlled by meteorological visibility, hence minimum visibility limits feature in the VMC minima. Visibility is also important to avoid terrain.\nBecause the basic traffic avoidance principle of flying under visual flight rules (VFR) is to \"see and avoid\", it follows that distance from clouds is an important factor in the VMC minima: as aircraft flying in clouds cannot be seen, a buffer zone from clouds is required (to provide for time to react to an aircraft exiting the clouds).\nICAO recommends the VMC minima internationally; they are defined in national regulations, which rarely significantly vary from ICAO. The main variation is in the units of measurement as different states use different units of measurement in aviation. The minima tend to be stricter in controlled airspace, where there is a lot of traffic therefore greater visibility and cloud clearance is desirable. The degree of separation provided by air traffic control is also a factor. For example, in class A and B airspace where all aircraft are provided with positive separation, the VMC minima feature visibility limits only, whereas in classes C\u2013G airspace where some or all aircraft are not separated from each other by air traffic control, the VMC minima also feature cloud separation criteria.\nIt is important not to confuse IMC with IFR (instrument flight rules) \u2013 IMC describes the actual weather conditions, while IFR describes the rules under which the aircraft is flying. Aircraft can (and often do) fly IFR in clear weather, for operational reasons or when flying in airspace where flight under VFR is not permitted; indeed by far the majority of commercial flights are operated solely under IFR.\nIt is possible to be flying VFR in conditions that are legally considered VMC and have to rely on flight instruments for attitude control because there is no distinct external horizon, for example, on a dark night over water (which may create a so-called black hole effect) or a clear night with lights on the water and stars in the sky looking the same.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBarany chair\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEarly system for night and bad weather flying by mail pilots: Remelin, E.

Full members of the Lancashire County FA, they are currently members of the North West Counties League Division One and play at Crilly Park.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club were established as an under-14 team by Joe Riley in 1956, and were originally named Laburnum Rovers, named after Laburnum Playing Fields where they first played. They joined the Briarcroft Junior League in December that year despite the season already having started, as there was an odd number of teams due to other clubs dropping out; their first competitive fixture was a league cup game against Marsh Players A, which they lost 10\u20130.\nAs the players exceeded the league's age limit, the club applied to join the Farnworth under-17s League. However it folded before the season started, and club applied to join the Leigh & District League instead, a full age competition. In 1961 they joined the Bolton Combination. They won the Division Two and the Division Two Trophy in 1965\u201366, and after moving into a new ground in the summer of 1966, were promoted to Division One for the 1966\u201367 season.\nIn 1980 the club joined Division Two of the Cheshire County League, but had to change their name as league rules required the name of the town to be included; as a result they became Atherton Laburnum Rovers. Two seasons later the league merged with the Lancashire Combination to form the North West Counties League, with Atherton placed in Division Two. In the 1984\u201385 season they won the Bolton Hospital Cup, beating Scotts Park United 3\u20131 in the final.\nDespite finishing second-from-bottom of Division Two in 1986\u201387 the club were promoted to Division One as part of league reorganisation and due to the quality of the facilities at Crilly Park. In 1992\u201393 the club won the Division One title, and after retaining it the following season, were promoted to Division One of the Northern Premier League. The 1993\u201394 season also saw them reach the semi-finals of the FA Vase, in which they lost 2\u20131 to Diss Town in a replay at VS Rugby after the two legs finished 3\u20133 on aggregate; the quarter final match against Aldershot saw the setting of the club's record attendance of 1,856.\nThe club spent three seasons in the Northern Premier League, before finishing bottom of the division in 1996\u201397, resulting in relegation back to Division One of the North West Counties League. In 1998\u201399 they won the Goldline Trophy, beating Atherton Town 3\u20130 in the final Hilton Park in Leigh. In 1999\u20132000 the club were relegated again, this time to Division Two, after finishing bottom of Division One. However, a third-place finish in Division Two the following season saw them promoted back to Division One at the first attempt. They also won the Bolton Hospital Cup for a second time, beating Ramsbottom United 2\u20131 in the final.\nThe 2003\u201304 season saw Atherton win two trophies; the Goldline Trophy was won when Blackrod Town were beaten 4\u20131 at the Reebok Stadium, whilst the Bolton Hospital Cup was won with a 3\u20131 win over Eagley at the same venue. They remained in the division (which was renamed the Premier Division in 2008) until finishing bottom of the table in 2011\u201312, after which they were relegated to Division One.\n\n\n== Ground ==\nThe club play home matches at Crilly Park, which has a capacity of 3,000, of which 250 is seated; three sides of the ground are covered.\nThey originally played at Laburnum Road Playing Fields, from which they took their name, and used a shed in a nearby allotment as a changing room. Two seasons later they moved to Hag Fold two seasons later. In order to progress in the Bolton Combination, the club was required to provide better facilities, so obtained a field where they opened their Greendale ground in 1966.\nIn the early 1980s the ground was renamed Crilly Park in honour of former chairman Jack Crilly who died in 1980. A stand was erected behind one of the goals in 1983, with two more covered areas built in 1986 and further cover in 1991. Floodlights were installed in 1989, with new clubhouse and changing rooms built two years later.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nNorth West Counties Football League\nDivision One champions 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394\nChampionship Trophy winners 1992\u201393, 1993\u201394\n\nBolton Combination\nDivision Two A champions 1965\u201366\nDivision Two Cup winners 1964\u201365, 1965\u201366\n\nGoldline Trophy\nWinners 1998\u201399, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305\n\nBolton Hospital Cup\nWinners 1984\u201385, 2001\u201302, 2003\u201304\n\nWesthoughton Charity Cup\nWinners 1981\u201382\n\n\n== Records ==\nRecord attendance: 1,740 vs Aldershot Town 1993\u201394\nBest FA Cup performance: Third qualifying round, 1996\u201397\nBest FA Trophy performance: First qualifying round, 1994\u201395, 1995\u201396, 1996\u201397\nBest FA Vase performance: Semi-finals, 1993\u201394\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtherton Laburnum Rovers F.C. players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "Geoffrey Eli \"Geoff\" Bodine (born April 18, 1949) is a retired American motorsport driver and bobsled builder. He is the oldest of the three Bodine brothers (with Brett Bodine and Todd Bodine). Bodine currently lives in West Melbourne, Florida.\nBodine's racing career seemed to be on track right from the start as his father and grandfather, Eli Bodine Jr. and Sr. built Chemung Speedrome just a year after he was born. He began learning his racing skills at this track in the micro-midget division when he was only five years old. He had such an itch to race that he disguised himself as a lady and entered a Powderpuff Division Race when he was 15. In 2011, he drove for Tommy Baldwin Racing in the Sprint Cup Series, alternating between the Nos. 35 and 36 teams, with sponsorship from Luke & Associates.\n\n\n== NASCAR Modified driver ==\nBodine was quite an accomplished driver before he hit the big-time in NASCAR's premier division, the Winston Cup series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup series) with his first start in 1979. By this time, Bodine was well known as a Modified driver in the Northeast, racing against popular drivers like Richie Evans, Jerry Cook, Jimmy Spencer, Ron Bouchard, and others. Bodine earned Modified championships at Stafford Speedway, Shangri-La Speedway, Spencer/Williamson Speedway, and Utica-Rome Speedway. He has won many of the big races in Modifieds including the Lancaster 200 (1978, 1981), Race of Champions (1972 - Trenton, 1978 - Pocono), the Stafford 200 (1978), the Trenton Dogleg 200 (1979), the Thompson 300, the Spring Sizzler (1980 - Stafford Speedway), Oswego Classic (1981), Cardinal Classic (1975 - Martinsville Speedway), Oxford 250 (1980, 1981), and other modified events.\nIn 1978, Bodine won more races than any other Modified driver in recorded history. Driving cars owned by Dick Armstrong with Billy Taylor and Ralph Hop Harrington as crew chief, Bodine started 84 feature events and won 55 of them. Among the most prestigious of these victories were the Race of Champions at Pocono, the Spring Sizzler at Stafford, the Budweiser 200 at Oswego, both major events at Martinsville, the Thompson 300, and a sweep of the six-race Yankee All-Star League series. For these fifty-five victories, Bodine is credited in the Guinness Book of World Records with \"Most wins in one season\".\nBodine's racing background also included wins in the Late Model division, Nationwide Series division, and others. He has six Busch Grand National wins to his credit.\n\n\n== NASCAR Winston Cup career ==\nGeoff is best known for his NASCAR Winston Cup (now Monster Energy) career. His first full season in Winston Cup came in 1982 when he earned the Rookie of the Year title. He earned his first Winston Cup pole that year on his 19th start (1982 - Firecracker 400) and scored his first Winston Cup victory two years later on his 69th start at Martinsville in 1984 (This win was also the first win for Hendrick Motorsports, which was the team Bodine was racing for at the time). Geoff's biggest win came at the 1986 Daytona 500 season opener. NASCAR's most prestigious single event. Other career highlights include the 1987 International Race of Champions championship, the 1992 Busch Clash, the 1994 Winston Select (despite a first segment spinout), and the 1994 Busch Pole Award (now Budweiser Pole Award). Geoff's final win in NASCAR's highest division came in the \"Bud At The Glen\" in August 1996 when fortuitous pit stop timing led to Geoff taking the lead in his QVC Thunderbird while the other drivers pitted. Bodine managed to hold off the field the rest of the way beating Terry Labonte to the line by 0.44 seconds to claim the checkers.\n\n\n=== Cup career highlights ===\n\nBodine has driven for some of the best car owners in NASCAR, including Junior Johnson, Bud Moore and Rick Hendrick as well as owning his own cars, which he ran for several seasons after buying the assets of Alan Kulwicki's race team after his death in 1993. He has 565 starts, 37 poles, 18 wins, and nearly $16 million in winnings during his Winston Cup/Nextel Cup career. He was honored as one of \"NASCAR's 50 Greatest Drivers\" during NASCAR's 50th anniversary celebration. Bodine has always been a great innovator and brought many ideas to Winston Cup. He introduced power steering and full-faced helmets to Winston Cup. He was also the last driver to win a race and lap the field, in the fall 1994 race at North Wilkesboro Speedway. He holds the track record at Atlanta Motor Speedway from his polesitting run after the track was repaved in 1997, with a speed of over 197 mph.\n\n\n=== Daytona crash ===\n\nWhile participating the inaugural Daytona 250 Truck Series race at Daytona International Speedway, on February 18, 2000, Bodine was involved in a vicious, fiery accident on the 57th lap of the race while driving the No. 15 Line-X-sponsored Ford F-150 for Billy Ballew. The crash started when rookie Kurt Busch made contact with Rob Morgan on the tri-oval front straightaway. Morgan to swerved into Bodine, sending his truck into the catch fencing at a speed of nearly 190 mph (310 km/h). The force of the impact tore the truck into pieces and ruptured the fuel cell, leaving only the roll cage. As the truck fell apart, it barrel-rolled down the frontstretch and got struck several more times by other trucks before coming to rest on its roof. 13 other trucks were involved, making it one of the largest wrecks in NASCAR Truck Series history. As a result of the collision, Bodine suffered fractures in his right wrist, right cheekbone, a vertebra in his back, and his right ankle as well as suffered a concussion. Nine spectators were also injured in the crash.\nIncredibly, Bodine missed only ten races of the 2000 Winston Cup season while recovering from his injuries, returning at Richmond International Raceway on May 6 and finishing 13th in a 400-lap race. However, Bodine's struggles over the ensuing months led to his dismissal from the team in September. In a feat of great accomplishment, he returned in the 2002 Daytona 500 to finish third behind race winner Ward Burton and second-placer finisher Elliott Sadler. However, including that race, Bodine only managed to make 18 starts in the NASCAR Cup Series between 2001 and 2004, with only one Top 5 and two Top 10's both in 2002. He attempted to qualify for the 2004 Brickyard 400 driving for Gary Trout Autosports, but was unable to and made no more attempts at any other races that year.\n\n\n=== New team ===\nGeoff, brother Todd, and Larry Gunselman started a race team in 2009. Geoff attempted to qualify the No. 64 Toyota for the 2009 Daytona 500. In 2010, Geoff returned to the Camping World Truck Series for the first time since 2004 with Team Gill Racing at Atlanta. He finished 26th with engine problems despite qualifying an impressive 8th.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nIn October 2012, Bodine announced through TheRacingExperts.Com that he was retiring from NASCAR after 27 seasons. Bodine said he wanted to spend time with his family and do charitable deeds.\nIn June 2012 he opened a Honda Power Sports dealership in West Melbourne, Florida, where he currently resides.\nAs of August 2014, Bodine is a Driver Analyst for The Racing Experts, the website that announced his retirement in 2012.\n\n\n== Bo-Dyn bobsleds ==\n\nBodine's creativity and innovation are not just limited to NASCAR racing. Bodine is the co-owner of the Bo-Dyn Bobsled Company. His bobsled interest while watching the 1992 Winter Olympics when the U.S. Bobsled team was having a tough time during competition. Bodine learned that the sleds being used were all imported and not built domestically. He felt that he could help the team win with better technology derived from his race car experience, engineering background, as well as the abundant design and construction resources offered to him through his NASCAR connections. With his interest captured, Bodine took a few runs in a bobsled at Lake Placid to confirm his feelings and to learn more about the sleds.\nBo-Dyn Bobsleds (Bo for Bodine, \"Dyn\" for Chassis Dynamics) was created in 1992 by Bodine and his good friend and chassis builder, Bob Cuneo of Chassis Dynamics. Bodine founded the USA Bobsled Project to help create a winning bobsled for the U.S. teams. The U.S. National Team first used their sleds in 1994. Ten years after Bo-Dyn's inception, the U.S. team won three medals in Bo-Dyn Bobsleds during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, American bobsledder Steven Holcomb piloted a Bo-Dyn Bobsled named \"Night Train\" to gold. Every January from 2006 to 2010 at the Lake Placid, New York track, a charity run is held with the US bobsled team and NASCAR drivers to raise money for the sled project. Participants have included Todd Bodine (one of Bodine's brothers) and Tony Stewart.\n\n\n== Motorsports career results ==\n\n\n=== NASCAR ===\n(key) (Bold \u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

It is located inside Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park.\nThe area is used as a base for those climbing Ixtacc\u00edhuatl. It also is recognizable for its large television tower, used by Televisa for the transmission of analog television to Puebla and Cuernavaca.\nThe Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico also maintains an atmospheric observatory on the mountain.\n\n\n== Television ==\nThree digital television stations are based on the same tower. While each of them primarily serves Puebla, Cuernavaca and the state of Tlaxcala, they are licensed to Altzomoni:\nXEX-TDT (channel 42)\nXHTM-TDT (channel 36)\nXHATZ-TDT (channel 47)\nEach of these stations has digital facilities which are on Televisa's tower in Puebla.\n\n\n== References ==",

From January 2014 the cathedral underwent a process of internal and external renovation with works planned to finish in 2015. Therefore during that period of work the faithful had to carry out their religious activities in the nearby church of Our Lady Queen of the Angels (Nossa Senhora Rainha dos Anjos) .\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoman Catholicism in Brazil\nSacred Heart Cathedral\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Crush Pinball is a series of pinball video games developed by Compile and distributed by Naxat Soft and later Hudson Soft. A common theme amongst all installments in the series that sets them apart from other pinball games is the presence of sci-fi, fantasy or occult themes.\nThe series started in 1988 when Alien Crush was released for the Turbografx-16, which featured a sci-fi atmosphere reminiscent of the film Alien. It was then followed 2 years later by Devil's Crush, also for the Turbografx-16 which featured an occult theme with skulls, skeletons, and demons. A third game was later developed for the Super Famicom called Jaki Crush that contained a Japanese demon/ogre mythology theme, although the game was never released outside Japan. The series was revived in 2008 when Hudson Soft published a sequel/remake to Alien Crush called Alien Crush Returns for WiiWare.\nWhile Jaki Crush became largely obscure, Alien Crush and Devil's Crush were well received and have both been re-released on the Virtual Console.\n\n\n== Games ==\nAlien Crush - 1988 - TG16\nDevil's Crush - 1990 - TG16\nJaki Crush - 1992 - Super Famicom\nDragon's Revenge - 1993 - Mega Drive (sequel to Mega Drive port; by Tengen)\nAlien Crush Returns - 2008 - WiiWare\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHard Core Gaming 101 - Crush Pinball",

            "content": "Cynthia Ann Stephanie \"Cyndi\" Lauper (born June 22, 1953) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and LGBT rights activist. Her career has spanned over 30 years. Her debut solo album She's So Unusual (1983) was the first debut female album to chart four top-five hits on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\", \"Time After Time\", \"She Bop\", and \"All Through the Night\"\u2014and earned Lauper the Best New Artist award at the 27th Grammy Awards in 1985. Her success continued with the soundtrack for the motion picture The Goonies and her second record True Colors (1986). This album included the number one single \"True Colors\" and \"Change of Heart\", which peaked at number three.\nSince 1989, Lauper has released nine studio albums and participated in many other projects. In 2010, Memphis Blues, became Billboard's most successful blues album of the year, remaining at number one on the Billboard Blues Albums chart for 13 consecutive weeks. In 2013, Lauper won the Tony Award for best original score for composing the Broadway musical Kinky Boots, making her the first woman to win the category by herself. The musical was awarded five other Tonys including Tony Award for Best New Musical. In 2014, Lauper was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album for the cast recording. In 2016, the West End production won Best New Musical at the Olivier Awards \nLauper has established herself as a pop culture icon selling over 50 million records and 20 million singles. She has won awards at the Grammys, Emmys, Tonys, the New York's Outer Critics Circle, MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), Billboard Awards, and American Music Awards (AMAs). An inductee into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Lauper is one of the few singers to win three of the four major American entertainment awards (EGOT). Lauper won the inaugural Best Female Video prize at the 1984 VMAs for Girls Just Want To Have Fun. This music video is recognized by MTV, VH1 and Rolling Stone Magazine as one of the greatest ever music videos of the era. She is featured in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum's Women Who Rock exhibit. Her debut album is included in Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, while Time After Time is included in Vh1's list of the 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 years. VH1 has ranked Lauper No. 58 of the 100 Greatest Women of Rock & Roll.\nLauper is known for both her distinctive image featuring a variety of hair colors, eccentric clothing and is particularly known for her powerful and distinctive four-octave singing range.\nLauper has been celebrated for her humanitarian work, particularly as an advocate for LGBT rights in the United States. Her charitable efforts were acknowledged in 2013 when the singer was invited as a special guest to attend U.S. President Barack Obama's second-term inauguration.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== 1953\u20131979: Early life ===\nLauper was born at Boulevard Hospital in Astoria, Queens, New York City, to a Catholic family. Her father, Fred, was of German and Swiss descent. Her mother, Catrine (n\u00e9e Gallo), is Italian American (from Sicily). Lauper's siblings are younger brother Fred (nicknamed Butch), and older sister, Ellen. Lauper's parents divorced when she was five. Her mother remarried and divorced again.\nLauper grew up in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens and, as a child, listened to such artists as The Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. At age 12, she began writing songs and playing an acoustic guitar given to her by her sister.\nLauper expressed herself with a variety of hair colors, eccentric clothing and even took a friend's advice to spell her name as \"Cyndi\" rather than \"Cindy\".\nLauper went to Richmond Hill High School, but was expelled, although she later earned her GED. She left home at 17, to escape her abusive stepfather, intending to study art. Her journey took her to Canada, where she spent two weeks in the woods with her dog Sparkle, trying to find herself. She eventually traveled to Vermont, where she took art classes at Johnson State College and supported herself working odd jobs.\nIn the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as Janis Joplin. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing covers. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing. She was told by doctors that she would never sing again, but regained her voice with the help of vocal coach Katie Agresta.\n\n\n=== 1980\u20131982: Blue Angel ===\n\nIn 1978, Lauper met saxophone player John Turi through her manager Ted Rosenblatt. Turi and Lauper formed a band named Blue Angel and recorded a demo tape of original music. Steve Massarsky, manager of The Allman Brothers Band, heard the tape and liked Lauper's voice. He bought Blue Angel's contract for $5,000 and became their manager.\nLauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by Polydor Records and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like Big Bird, but Rolling Stone magazine later included it as one of the 100 best new wave album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (\"It went lead\", as Lauper later joked) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling-out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy. After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord.\nAfter Blue Angel broke up, Lauper spent time, due to her financial problems, working in retail stores, waitressing at IHOP (which she quit after being demoted to hostess when the manager made a pass at her), and singing in local clubs. Her most frequent gigs were at El Sombrero. Music critics who saw Lauper perform with Blue Angel believed she had star potential due to her four-octave singing range. In 1981, while singing in a local New York bar, Lauper met David Wolff, who took over as her manager and had her sign a recording contract with Portrait Records, a subsidiary of Epic Records.\n\n\n=== 1983\u20131985: She's So Unusual ===\n\nOn October 14, 1983, Lauper released her first solo album, She's So Unusual. The album peaked at No. 4 in the US, and became a worldwide hit. The primary studio musicians were Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman (of The Hooters), Rick Chertoff, Richard Termini and Peter Wood. Lauper became popular with teenagers and critics, in part due to her hybrid punk image, which was crafted by stylist Patrick Lucas.\nLauper was interested in writing her own songs, but the record company provided her with songs to record that were written by other writers. Lauper sometimes changed the lyrics in the material she was given by the record company; such is the case with \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\". Lauper found the original lyrics to be misogynistic, so she rewrote the song as an anthem for young women.\nThe album's second single \"Time After Time\" was co-written by Lauper and Rob Hyman. \"Time After Time\" hit No. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. The song would earn Lauper an RIAA Gold certification for record sales that reached 500,000 copies, and was later covered by Miles Davis on his album \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest\u201d. It became a staple of Davis\u2019 live shows at the time, featuring on the live album \u201cLive around the world\u201d.\nThe other Billboard Hot 100 singles on She's So Unusual were \"She Bop\" (No. 3), \"All Through the Night\" (No. 5), written by Jules Shear, and \"Money Changes Everything\" (No.27).\nThe album includes five cover songs, including The Brains' new wave track \"Money Changes Everything\" (No. 27 on the Billboard Hot 100) and Prince's \"When You Were Mine\". The album made Lauper the first female to have four consecutive Billboard Hot 100 top five hits from one album. The LP stayed in the Top 200 charts for more than 65 weeks, and since has sold 16 million copies worldwide.\nLauper won Best New Artist at the 1985 Grammy Awards. She's So Unusual also received nominations for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (for \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\"), and Song of the Year (for \"Time After Time\"). It also won the Grammy for Best Album Package, which went to the art director, Janet Perr.\nThe video for \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\" won the inaugural award for Best Female Video at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards, and made Lauper an MTV staple. The video featured professional wrestling manager \"Captain\" Lou Albano as Lauper's father, and her real-life mother, Catrine, as her mother, and also featured her attorney, her manager, her brother Butch, and her dog Sparkle. In 1984\u201385, Lauper appeared on the covers of Rolling Stone magazine, Time, and Newsweek. She appeared twice on the cover of People, and was named a Ms. magazine Woman of the Year in 1985.\nIn 1985, Lauper participated in USA for Africa's famine-relief fund-raising single \"We Are the World\", which sold more than 20 million copies since then.\nLauper appeared with professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, who played her \"bodyguard\" and would also later make many appearances as herself in a number of the World Wrestling Federation's \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\" events, and played Wendi Richter's manager in the inaugural WrestleMania event. Dave Wolff, Lauper's boyfriend and manager at the time, was a wrestling fan as a boy, and engineered the rock and wrestling connection.\nIn 1985, Lauper released the single \"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\", from the soundtrack to the movie The Goonies, and an accompanying video which featured several wrestling stars. The song reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n\n=== 1986\u20131988: True Colors and Vibes ===\nLauper received two nominations at the 1986 Grammy Awards: Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for \"What a Thrill\" and Best Long Form Music Video for Cyndi Lauper in Paris.\nLauper released her second album, True Colors, on September 18, 1986. It reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and sold 2 million copies in the US.

As in Hat Full of Stars, some of the songs in Sisters of Avalon addressed dark themes. The song \"Ballad of Cleo and Joe\" addressed the complications of a drag queen's double life. The song \"Say a Prayer\" was written for a friend of hers who had died from AIDS. \"Unhook the Stars\" was used in the movie of the same name.

Sheila Moeschen argued that the song 'embodied a different kind of feminine aesthetic that ran counter to the raw sensuality and edginess of her contemporaries like Madonna or veteran rockers Joan Jett and Pat Benatar' that introduced 'a nation of women to a new kind of female role model, one that celebrated difference and encouraged playfulness in self-expression'. John Rockwell wrote that the song was \"a giddily upbeat attestation to female pleasure that simultaneously made a feminist statement, fulfilled male fantasies and\u2014especially in its often-played video version\u2014evoked the warmth of family and friends.\" The video for \"Girls\" won the first-ever Best Female Video prize at the 1984 VMAs. It featured a multicultural cast of women with teased, sideways hair and neon eye shadow, singing alongside Lauper. She was the first woman to have four Top 5 hits from a debut album, the first woman to win the composing category solo during the 2013 Tony Awards and one of only four women to have won competitive Grammy, Emmy and Tony awards.\nLauper's song \"Time After Time\" has been covered by over 100 artists and was ranked at #22 on Rolling Stone's 100 Best Songs of the Past 25 Years and at #19 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of the 80s.\n\"She Bop\", the third single from She's So Unusual made history as the first and only top ten song to directly mention a gay porn magazine. The single was included in the PMRC's \"Filthy Fifteen\" list that led to the parental advisory sticker that marked recordings thought to be unsuitable for young listeners. In their 1984 retrospective Rolling Stone listed She Bop as the 36th best song of that year, praising it for its unusual playfulness regarding sexuality.\nHer song \"True Colors\" is recognized by many as an LGBT anthem. Her many projects supporting LGBT rights made her a gay icon.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nShe's So Unusual (1983)\nTrue Colors (1986)\nA Night to Remember (1989)\nHat Full of Stars (1993)\nSisters of Avalon (1996)\nMerry Christmas ...

The term was used for the first time by Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 in 1816 to differentiate liturgical books written in the Serbian recension from those written in the Russian recension, which gradually replaced srbulje at the beginning of the 19th century.\nUntil the end of the 15th century srbulje were only written books. Since 1494 (Cetinje Octoechos) until 1570 several printing houses printed srbulje.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe oldest mention of the term is in a letter to Jernej Kopitar by Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 on 1 August 1816. One of the reasons for designating a particular name for old printed or written Serbian language books was to differentiate them from the Russian language liturgical books.\n\n\n== History ==\nSrbulje were published in printed form in the 15th and 16th centuries. The history of printing of early Serbian language books is connected with historical situation on the territory populated by Serbs. When printing press was invented significant part of this territory was captured by Ottoman Empire which subjected Christian population to process of islamization. The printing of Serbian language books had a mission to resist to the islamization of the Serbs and to preserve their identity as internal enemies of the Ottoman Empire. Faced with danger from the Ottoman Empire, Venice and Vatican tollerated to certain extent activities of Serbian diaspora and printing of srbulje.\nThe first book printed on Serbian language is Cetinje Octoechos (Serbian: \u041e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0445) which is of exceptional importance as the first book printed on Serbian language. It was printed by Hieromonk Makarije in the Crnojevi\u0107 printing house, established \u0110ura\u0111 Crnojevi\u0107 in Zeta.\nDuring 16th century srbulje were printed in many other printing shops, including Serbian Venetian Printing House, Gora\u017ede printing house, Rujno Monastery printing house and many other. Most of printing houses were established in churches and monasteries, which was by some scholars perceived as an evidence that Serbian Orthodox Church still received significant income, although Serbia was under Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans were opposed to the printing of the books generally, and especially to Christian liturgical books. According to some authors, printing houses were deliberately established in remote churches and monasteries like in case of Mrk\u0161ina crkva printing house, Rujno Monastery printing house and Gora\u017ede printing house, to hide their activities from the Ottomans.\nJerolim Zagurovi\u0107 and Vi\u0107enco Vukovi\u0107 were the last printers of printed srbulje. There was only one book printed in 1638 in Venice by Bartholomew Ginami, but that was only a reprint of psalter with book of hours published by Zagurovi\u0107 in 1569.\n\n\n== Early 19th century collecting ==\nAt the beginning of the 19th century collectionaries from many different countries, including Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107, collected srbulje. In Montenegro and Herzegovina this task was performed by Vuk Popovi\u0107 (priest from Kotor) and Vuk Vr\u010devi\u0107, on behalf of Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107.  Vuk Popovi\u0107 received from Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 new liturgical books printed on Serbian language and exchanged them for srbulje. Three Vuks (Karad\u017ei\u0107, Popovi\u0107 and Vr\u010devi\u0107) with support of Russian scholars collected almost all remaining srbulje from Montenegro. Besides from Montenegro, Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 also received srbulje from Dalmatia, Zadar, Osijek, Sombor, etc... Every time he travelled to Serbia Karad\u017ei\u0107 would use the opportunity to visit monasteries and prepare lists of their old liturgical books. This activities were not always welcomed by the people in service of knjaz Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 in Kragujevac.\n\n\n== Replacing with Russian books ==\nThe influence of Russian language liturgical books began back in 1726 when Russian graduate teachers from Kyiv Mohyla Academy arrived at Sremski Karlovci's newly-established Slavonic-Latin-Greek schools. Based on the monastic rules of Vikentije Jovanovi\u0107 (Metropolitan of Karlovci) liturgical books had to be written in Russian. At the beginning of 19th century srbulje became scarce so churches had to import and use Russian language liturgical books. During 1830s srbulje were replaced with books written in Russian language.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

It is the second of six elevated stations when travelling towards the terminus of San Isidro.\nThe station is located in the district of the same name, in one of the city's more important industrial zones. It is the least used station on the network, carrying 1% of the network's passengers at peak times. In June 2016, the station was used by 1,679 people per day on average, in contrast to the stations before and after it on the line, 12 de Octubre and San Miguelito, which were used by over 34,000 people daily. Architect \u00c1lvaro Uribe justified the station's creation on the basis that it would encourage future development in the area.\n\n\n== References ==",

The name is derived from their yellow top and black body.\nThe Singapore Taxi Transport Association (STTA) is a union catering to those private taxi drivers. The Association mainly takes care of administrative matters, such as the purchasing/selling of licenses and new vehicles.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1933, Wearnes introduced the first private Yellow-Top taxis. These cabs were the first of their kind in colonial Singapore.\nThe number of taxis in the group has declined significantly due to competition from Uber and Grab.\n\n\n=== Vehicles used ===\nIn the late 1960s the first Yellow-Top taxis were the Mercedes Benz 220S Ponton, followed by the Austin Cambridge A60. In the 1970s the Cambridge A60 still continued until the early 1980s followed by the Opel Rekord D, Peugeot 504, Morris Marina and the Russian GAZ Volga 24. The static Nissan Cedric and Toyota Crown has been there for decades from 1980s. The Nissan Cedric taxis were scrapped in 2008 and Toyota Crown taxis were scrapped in 2012.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTaxicabs of Singapore\nTransport in Singapore\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Bali (Balinese: \u1b29\u1b2e\u1b36, Indonesian: Pulau Bali, Provinsi Bali) is an island and province of Indonesia. The province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan. It is located at the westernmost end of the Lesser Sunda Islands, with Java to the west and Lombok to the east. Its capital, Denpasar, is located in the southern part of the island.\nWith a population of 3,890,757 in the 2010 census, and 4,225,000 as of January 2014, the island is home to most of Indonesia's Hindu minority. According to the 2010 Census, 83.5% of Bali's population adhered to Balinese Hinduism, followed by 13.4% Muslim, Christianity at 2.5% and Buddhism 0.5%.\nBali is a popular tourist destination, which has seen a significant rise in tourists since the 1980s. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy. It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award.\nBali is part of the Coral Triangle, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species. In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about 7 times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Most recently, Bali was the host of the 2011 ASEAN Summit, 2013 APEC and Miss World 2013. Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, where each house rules a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they have been operational since their establishment prior to Dutch colonisation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient ===\nBali was inhabited around 2000 BC by Austronesian people who migrated originally from Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast Asia. Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines and Oceania. Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.\nIn ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Waisnawa, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.\nInscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where Buddhism and Sivaism were practiced simultaneously. Mpu Sindok's great-granddaughter, Mahendradatta (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king Udayana Warmadewa (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to Airlangga around 1001. This marriage also brought more Hinduism and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.\nBalinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly Hindu culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name Bali dwipa (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914 AD and mentioning Walidwipa. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system subak to grow rice in wet-field cultivation. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\nThe Hindu Majapahit Empire (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of Hayam Wuruk is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386. A mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the Majapahit Empire fell in 1520. Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.\n\n\n=== Portuguese contacts ===\nThe first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serr\u00e3o sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition. In 1585, a ship foundered off the Bukit Peninsula and left a few Portuguese in the service of Dewa Agung.\n\n\n=== Dutch East Indies ===\n\nIn 1597, the Dutch explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived at Bali, and the Dutch East India Company was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see Dutch East Indies). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other. In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his Wallace Line theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and Lombok. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir The Malay Archipelago, Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the unique Balinese irrigation methods:\n\nI was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about ten or twelve miles (16 or 19 kilometres) inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of coconut palms, tamarind and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe.\n\nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (puputan) to avoid the humiliation of surrender. Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender. In the Dutch intervention in Bali, a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in Klungkung. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and Maluku.\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, artists Miguel Covarrubias and Walter Spies, and musicologist Colin McPhee all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature.\" Western tourists began to visit the island. The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary Virgins of Bali about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene \"bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies\". Under the looser version of the Haynes code that existed up to 1934, nudity involving \"civilised\" (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with \"uncivilised\" (i.e. all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of Virgins of Bali. The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handedly made Bali into a popular spot for tourists.\n\nImperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on Borneo were inoperative due to heavy rains, the Imperial Japanese Army decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps Prajoda (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur]. The island was quickly captured.\nDuring the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch colonial rulers.\n\n\n=== Independence from the Dutch ===\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno and Hatta. Bali was included in the \"Republic of the United States of Indonesia\" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949. The first governor of Bali, Anak Agung Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.\n\n\n=== Contemporary ===\nThe 1963 eruption of Mount Agung killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be transmigrated to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional caste system, and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs. An attempted coup in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.\nThe army became the dominant power as it instigated a violent anti-communist purge, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population. With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.\nAs a result of the 1965-66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno out of the presidency. His \"New Order\" government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as \"paradise\" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country. A bombing in 2002 by militant Islamists in the tourist area of Kuta killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and another in 2005, severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship to the island.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe island of Bali lies 3.2 km (2 mi) east of Java, and is approximately 8 degrees south of the equator. Bali and Java are separated by the Bali Strait. East to west, the island is approximately 153 km (95 mi) wide and spans approximately 112 km (69 mi) north to south; administratively it covers 5,780 km2, or 5,577 km2 without Nusa Penida District, its population density is roughly 750 people/km2.\nBali's central mountains include several peaks over 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation and active volcanoes such as Mount Batur. The highest is Mount Agung (3,031 m (9,944 ft)), known as the \"mother mountain\" which is an active volcano rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years. As of late 2017 Mount Agung has started erupting and large numbers of people have been evacuated, the airport in Bali has been closed. The extent of the eruption is as of November 2017 impossible to predict. See Mount Agung, 2017 seismic activity and eruption. Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, Ayung River, flows approximately 75 km (see List of rivers of Bali).\nThe island is surrounded by coral reefs. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have black sand. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small sampan boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of Tanah Lot, they are not yet used for significant tourism.\n\nThe largest city is the provincial capital, Denpasar, near the southern coast. Its population is around 491,500 (2002). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, Singaraja, which is located on the north coast and is home to around 100,000 people. Other important cities include the beach resort, Kuta, which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and Ubud, situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.\nThree small islands lie to the immediate south east and all are administratively part of the Klungkung regency of Bali: Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.\nTo the east, the Lombok Strait separates Bali from Lombok and marks the biogeographical division between the fauna of the Indomalayan ecozone and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The transition is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major biomes. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, Bali was connected to Java and Sumatra and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nBeing just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around 30\u00b0C with a humidity level of about 85%.\nDay time temperatures at low elevations vary between 20\u201333\u00b0C (68\u201391\u00b0F), but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.\nThe west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During rainy season there is comparatively less tourists seen at Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays the weather is very unpredictable.\nOutside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nBali lies just to the west of the Wallace Line, and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok. An exception is the yellow-crested cockatoo, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered Bali myna, which is endemic. Others include barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, Java sparrow, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, milky stork, Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, sacred kingfisher, sea eagle, woodswallow, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, yellow-vented bulbul and great egret.\nUntil the early 20th century, Bali was home to several large mammals: the wild banteng, leopard and the endemic Bali tiger. The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.\n\nSquirrels are quite commonly encountered, less often is the Asian palm civet, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce Kopi Luwak. Bats are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of monkey occur. The crab-eating macaque, known locally as \"kera\", is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three \"monkey forest\" temples, such as the popular one in the Ubud area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the Javan langur, locally known as \"lutung\". They occur in few places apart from the Bali Barat National Park. They are born an orange colour, though by their first year they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration. In Java however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the leopard cat, Sunda pangolin and black giant squirrel.\nSnakes include the king cobra and reticulated python. The water monitor can grow to at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length and 50 kg (110 lb) and can move quickly.\nThe rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as Tulamben, Amed, Menjangan or neighbouring Nusa Penida, host a wide range of marine life, for instance hawksbill turtle, giant sunfish, giant manta ray, giant moray eel, bumphead parrotfish, hammerhead shark, reef shark, barracuda, and sea snakes. Dolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near Singaraja and Lovina.\n\nA team of scientists conducted a survey from 29 April 2011 to 11 May 2011 at 33 sea sites around Bali. They discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, Nusa Dua, Tulamben and Candidasa, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at Padangbai and between Padangbai and Amed. The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in Raja Ampat and Halmahera by 29% or in Fakfak and Kaimana by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang and Gili Mimpang in Candidasa, Karangasem regency.\nAmong the larger trees the most common are: banyan trees, jackfruit, coconuts, bamboo species, acacia trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: hibiscus, frangipani, bougainvillea, poinsettia, oleander, jasmine, water lily, lotus, roses, begonias, orchids and hydrangeas exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around Kintamani, certain species of fern trees, mushrooms and even pine trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: salak, mangosteen, corn, kintamani orange, coffee and water spinach.\n\n\n== Environment ==\n\nSome of the worst erosion has occurred in Lebih Beach, where up to seven metres (23 feet) of land is lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to Masceti Beach.\nFrom ranked third in previous review, in 2010 Bali got score 99.65 of Indonesia's environmental quality index and the highest of all the 33 provinces. The score measured three water quality parameters: the level of total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO) and chemical oxygen demand (COD).\nBecause of over-exploitation by the tourist industry which covers a massive land area, 200 out of 400 rivers on the island have dried up and based on research, the southern part of Bali would face a water shortage up to 2,500 litres of clean water per second by 2015. To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nThe province is divided into eight regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota). These are:\n\n\n== Economy ==\nIn 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment. Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related. By end of June 2011, non-performing loan of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan (about 5%). The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the Islamists terrorist bombings 2002 and 2005. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAlthough tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer. Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its artisans who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including batik and ikat cloth and clothing, wooden carvings, stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.\nThe Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near Mount Batur. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes. Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of \"Tri Hita Karana\". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic coffee production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a geographical indication.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nIn 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur was built by Sukarno, and boosted tourism in Bali. Prior to it, only three hotels existed on the island. Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased on Bali after the Ngurah Rai International Airport opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\nThe tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while significant in the other parts of the island as well. The main tourist locations are the town of Kuta (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and Seminyak (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of Sanur (once the only tourist hub), Ubud towards the center of the island, to the south of the Ngurah Rai International Airport, Jimbaran, and the newer developments of Nusa Dua and Pecatu.\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012 because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning. Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015 due to new terrorist threats.\n\nAn offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Million dollar villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic (many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active) investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors value for their currencies. Visitor arrivals for 2009 were forecast to drop 8% (which would be higher than 2007 levels), mainly due to the worldwide economic crisis which has also affected the global tourist industry.\nBali's tourism economy survived the Islamists terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has in fact slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels, although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.\nBali received the Best Island award from Travel and Leisure in 2010. Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after Santorini, Greece.\nIn August 2010, the film Eat Pray Love was released in theatres. The movie was based on Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling memoir Eat, Pray, Love. It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach at Bali. The 2006 book, which spent 57 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the New York Times paperback nonfiction best-seller list, had already fuelled a boom in Eat, Pray, Love-related tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist center that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance through traditional spirituality and healing that leads to love.\nIn January 2016, after music icon David Bowie died, it was revealed that in his will, Bowie asked for his ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to Buddhist rituals. He had visited and performed in a number of Southeast Asian cities early in his career, including Bangkok and Singapore.\nSince 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list. Chinese tourists increased by 17% from last year due to the impact of ACFTA and new direct flights to Bali. In January 2012, Chinese tourists year on year (yoy) increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% yoy.\nBali reported that it welcomed 2.88 million foreign tourists and 5 million domestic tourists in 2012, marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8 million foreign tourists.\nBased on a Bank Indonesia survey in May 2013, 34.39 percent of tourists are upper-middle class, spending between $1,286 to $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, France, China, Germany and the US. Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 percent of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 to $1,285. In 2017 it is expected that Chinese tourists will surpass Australian tourists as the most visited in Bali.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe Ngurah Rai International Airport is located near Jimbaran, on the isthmus at the southernmost part of the island. Lt.Col. Wisnu Airfield is found in north-west Bali.\nA coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching to 1,750m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines.\nIn December 2010 the Government of Indonesia invited investors to build a new Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at Karangasem, Bali with a projected worth of $30 million. On 17 July 2011 the first cruise ship (Sun Princess) anchored about 400 metres (1,300 feet) away from the wharf of Tanah Ampo harbour. The current pier is only 154 metres (505 feet) but will eventually be extended to 300 to 350 metres (980\u20131,150 feet) to accommodate international cruise ships. The harbour here is safer than the existing facility at Benoa and has a scenic backdrop of east Bali mountains and green rice fields. The tender for improvement was subject to delays, and as of July 2013 the situation remained unclear with cruise line operators complaining and even refusing to use the existing facility at Tanah Ampo.\nA Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by two ministers, Bali's Governor and Indonesian Train Company to build 565 kilometres (351 miles) of railway along the coast around the island. As of July 2015, no details of this proposed railways have been released.\nOn 16 March 2011 (Tanjung) Benoa port received the \"Best Port Welcome 2010\" award from London's \"Dream World Cruise Destination\" magazine. Government plans to expand the role of Benoa port as export-import port to boost Bali's trade and industry sector. The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry has confirmed that 306 cruise liners are heading for Indonesia in 2013 \u2013 an increase of 43 percent compared to the previous year.\nIn May 2011, an integrated Aerial Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at four crossing points: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all traffic lights, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other ASEAN countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.\n\nOn 21 December 2011 construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-Ngurah Rai International Airport toll road which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the 9.91-kilometre-long (6.16-mile) toll road (totally 12.7 kilometres (7.89 miles) with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49 trillion ($273.9 million). The project goes through 2 kilometres (1 mile) of mangrove forest and through 2.3 kilometres (1.4 miles) of beach, both within 5.4 hectares (13 acres) area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars which occupied 2 hectares of mangroves forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21 December 2011 the Dewa Ruci 450-metre (1,480-foot) underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136 billion ($14.9 million) from the state budget. On 23 September 2013, the Bali Mandara Toll Road was opened, with the Dewa Ruci Junction (Simpang Siur) underpass being opened previously.\nTo solve chronic traffic problems, the province will also build a toll road connecting Serangan with Tohpati, a toll road connecting Kuta, Denpasar and Tohpati and a flyover connecting Kuta and Ngurah Rai Airport.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe population of Bali was 3,890,757 as of the 2010 Census; the latest estimate (for January 2014) is 4,225,384. There are an estimated 30,000 expatriates living in Bali.\n\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\nA DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al. found that 12% of Balinese Y-chromosomes are of likely Indian origin, while 84% are of likely Austronesian origin, and 2% of likely Melanesian origin. The study does not correlate the DNA samples to the Balinese caste system.\n\n\n=== Caste system ===\n\nPre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a \"very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence\". The four castes have been classified as Soedra (Shudra), Wesia (Vaishyas), Satrias (Kshatriyas) and Brahmana (Brahmin).\nThe 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that Balinese caste had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the \"received understandings concerning its Indian origins\". In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelled Soedra) have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes. In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite meweda (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nUnlike most of Muslim-majority Indonesia, about 83.5% of Bali's population adheres to Balinese Hinduism, formed as a combination of existing local beliefs and Hindu influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include Islam (13.37%), Christianity (2.47%), and Buddhism (0.5%).\nThe general beliefs and practices of Agama Hindu Dharma are a mixture of ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of panca sila. Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray. However, officially, Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national ideology. Indonesian school text books describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam. Scholars contest whether these Indonesian government recognised and assigned beliefs reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.\nBalinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, that arrived through Java. Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century. Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to 78 AD. Stories from the Mahabharata Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in southeast Indian peninsular region (now Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka Andhra Pradesh).\nThe Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.\nApart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist Chinese immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's odalan. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nBalinese and Indonesian are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are bilingual or trilingual. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from Java, Lombok, Sumatra, and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the Balinese caste system and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. Kawi and Sanskrit are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\nEnglish and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the tourism industry, as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as Japanese, Korean, French, Russian or German are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. Balinese cuisine is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as gamelan, is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous Balinese dances include pendet, legong, baris, topeng, barong, gong keybar, and kecak (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.\n\n\n=== Festivals ===\n\nThroughout the year, there are a number of festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.\nThe Hindu New Year, Nyepi, is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ogoh-ogoh monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese pawukon calendrical system.\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or odalan (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of d\u00e9sa kala patra, which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context. Many of the ceremonial art forms such as wayang kulit and topeng are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation. Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ram\u00e9, is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more gamelan ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ram\u00e9.\n\nKaja and kelod are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (kaja), and the sea (kelod). In addition to spatial orientation, kaja and kelod have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest kaja. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as wali, the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where bebali ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called bali-balihan. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of tourism is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the barong dance have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a barong mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied. Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as customary law sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"kasepekang\", or shunning) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents Bali Arts Festival to showcase Bali\u2019s performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a year, from second week of June until end of July.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nBali is a major world surfing destination with popular breaks dotted across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan.\nAs part of the Coral Triangle, Bali, including Nusa Penida, offers a wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs, and tropical aquatic life.\nBali was the host of 2008 Asian Beach Games. It was the second time Indonesia hosted an Asia-level multi-sport event, after Jakarta held the 1962 Asian Games.\nIn football, Bali is home to the football club Bali United, which plays in the Liga 1. The team was relocated from Samarinda, East Kalimantan to Gianyar, Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he did the name change and moved the homebase to Bali because there were no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia. Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda prefer to support Pusamania Borneo F.C. more than Persisam.\n\n\n== Heritage sites ==\nIn June 2012, Subak, the irrigation system for paddy fields in Jatiluwih, central Bali was enlisted as a Natural UNESCO world heritage site.\n\n\n== Beauty pageant ==\nBali was the host of Miss World 2013 (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant.\n\n\n== International partnerships ==\n Penang, Malaysia\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBalinese Hinduism\nBalinese architecture\nBalinese temple\nBalinese dance\nTourism in Indonesia\nCulture of Indonesia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHaer, Debbie Guthrie; Morillot, Juliette & Toh, Irene (2001).

            "content": "The Coordinating Council on Jerusalem was a lobbying group launched on October 23 2007, in order to unite American Jewish organizations on behalf of a secure and unified Jerusalem. The creation of political strategist Jeff Ballabon, it was founded to provide a united public front of Jewish American organizations towards the principle of keeping Jerusalem united. Initial funding was provided by Rabbi Pesach Lerner, Executive Vice President of the National Council of Young Israel. It has been endorsed by hundreds of Jewish leaders in the Diaspora and Israel.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn preparation for the Annapolis Peace summit with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, ministers of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert\u2019s government put forth their view that Jerusalem was negotiable and opened the door to concessions of parts of Jerusalem, including the Temple Mount, which is considered by many to be Judaism\u2019s holiest site. Following his ministers\u2019 remarks, Olmert himself questioned the value of maintaining Jewish sovereignty over certain Jerusalem neighborhoods. As a result, many Jewish leaders around the world who held to a policy of not publicly challenging decisions of Israel's government, have chosen to coalesce around the position: opposing Israeli negotiations which include any discussion of ceding sovereignty over part or all of Jerusalem.\nThrough his reading of the significance of negotiating on Jerusalem, Rabbi Lerner asked Jeffrey Ballabon, a nationally experienced strategist with expertise in issue campaigns, crisis management and government relations to recommend and execute a broad-based international strategy to ensure continued Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem. As a first step, the two called for the creation of a body to coordinate and leverage efforts in Israel and the Diaspora to secure Jewish interests in Jerusalem\u2019s future.\nThe formation of the Coordinating Council for Jerusalem marks the first time since the establishment of the State of Israel that a significant group of American Jewish organizations have created a broad united front to pursue a policy directly involving Israel that is based on an explicit principle that supersedes deference to the sitting Israeli government. Notably, many of the organizations on the Coordinating Council are among the State of Israel\u2019s most loyal and active supporters.\nWithin hours of the announcement of their intent to create the Coordinating Council, Lerner and Ballabon were contacted by many groups, within the U.S. and Israel, which also had decided to coordinate their efforts against any Jerusalem negotiations.\nIn coordination with CCJ's efforts, a majority of the Israeli Knesset signed on to a letter declaring that they would not support any division of Jerusalem. Subsequently, the Knesset passed a law requiring a two-thirds supermajority of Knesset in order to make any changes to the borders or status of Jerusalem.\nCCJ also announced from the outset that it would be working closely and coordinating efforts with major Christian Zionist organizations and leaders.\nCCJ and CCJ member organizations have held meetings to put forward their position with U.S. national leaders, including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President George W. Bush's National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and former Deputy National Security Advisor Elliott Abrams, to inform them of the opposition to any negotiations that would cede any part of Jerusalem. Olmert has stated that American Jews and Jewish groups have no right or place to interfere with Israel's government matters.\nThe Coordinating Council on Jerusalem includes Americans for a Safe Israel, Association for Jewish Outreach Programs, Emunah of America, Hineni, Jerusalem Reclamation Project, National Conference of Synagogue Youth, National Council of Young Israel, One Israel Fund, Poalei Agudath Israel of America, Rabbinic Alliance to Save Jerusalem, Rabbinical Alliance of America, Rabbinical Council of America, Religious Zionists of America, Russian Jewish Community Foundation, Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations (OU), Unity Coalition for Israel, Young Israel Council of Rabbis, and Zionist Organization of America.\nIn January 2008, Coordinating Council on Jerusalem publicly announced a strategic alliance with Natan Sharansky's One Jerusalem.\n\n\n=== Opposition to CCJ ===\nWhile there is a steady group of supporters for the CCJ and its position, groups affiliated with the traditional Jewish left have stated opposition to CCJ and support for Olmert's position. Olmert himself was critical of CCJ and publicly denounced the involvement of Diaspora Jews within a few days of the announcement of the formation of CCJ. He subsequently backtracked on that position.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIsrael lobby in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Boerdijk, is a linear stacking of regular tetrahedra, arranged so that the edges of the complex that belong to only one tetrahedron form three intertwined helices. There are two chiral forms, with either clockwise or counterclockwise windings. Contrary to any other stacking of Platonic solids, the Boerdijk\u2013Coxeter helix is not rotationally repetitive. Even in an infinite string of stacked tetrahedra, no two tetrahedra will have the same orientation. This is because the helical pitch per cell is not a rational fraction of the circle.\nBuckminster Fuller named it a tetrahelix and considered them with regular and irregular tetrahedral elements.\n\n\n== Geometry ==\nThe coordinates of vertices of Boerdijk\u2013Coxeter helix composed of tetrahedrons with unit edge length can be written in the form\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        r\n        cos\n        \u2061\n        n\n        \u03b8\n        ,\n        r\n        sin\n        \u2061\n        n\n        \u03b8\n        ,\n        n\n        h\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (r\\cos n\\theta ,r\\sin n\\theta ,nh)}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        3\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        10\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r=3{\\sqrt {3}}/10}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b8\n        =\n        \u00b1\n        \n          cos\n          \n            \u2212\n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        (\n        \u2212\n        3\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta =\\pm \\cos ^{-1}(-3/2)}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        =\n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          \n            10\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h=1/{\\sqrt {10}}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   is an arbitrary integer.

When superimposed onto the 3-sphere curvature it becomes periodic, with a period of ten vertices, encompassing all 30 cells. The collective of such helices in the 600-cell represent a discrete Hopf fibration. While in 3 dimensions the edges are helices, in the imposed 3-sphere topology they are geodesics and have no torsion. They spiral around each other naturally due to the Hopf fibration.\nIn addition, the 16-cell partitions into two 8-tetrahedron rings, four edges long, and the 5-cell partitions into a single degenerate 5-tetrahedron ring.\n\n\n== Related polyhedral helixes ==\nEquilateral square pyramids can also be chained together as a helix, with two vertex configurations, 3.4.3.4 and 3.3.4.3.3.4.

The castle was built in 1353 as a boundary fortification of the earldom Mark.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe castle was built in 1353 by Gerhard of Plettenberg, a vassal of earl Engelbrecht III of the Mark. Levold of Northof (1279-1359?), the chronicler of earl Engelbrecht, wrote\nIn denseluen jair, als die vurs. Greue Engelbrecht auer Meer reysden, beghan Gerit van Plettenbrecht in afwesen des Greuen dat Slot ind Stat to nyenraide in Suderlande to tymmeren ind oick Slot ten Cluysensteyn.\nwhich translates to\nIn the year when Earl Engelbrecht was traveling beyond the sea, Gerit of Plettenberg in the absence of his earl began to build the castle and town of Neuenrade in the Sauerland, as well as the castle of Klusenstein.\nThe castle formed the boundary fortification of the earldom Mark to the bishopric state of Cologne and the earldom Arnsberg. All three territories met at the H\u00f6nne river valley, the castle was also overlooking an old road crossing the valley. During the feud between earl Engelbert and Gottfried IV of Arnsberg, the castle was under siege in 1366, but did not fall.\nWhen the last earl of Arnsberg, Gottfried IV, sold the earldom to the bishop of Cologne, the castle lost its importance. Until the 17th century the family of Werminghausen owned the castle. During the 30 years war (1618-48) both Swedish and Hessian troops stayed in the castle. In 1695 the Brabeck family bought the castle, and was sold in 1812 to the L\u00f6bbecke family. In 1904 it was sold to the Hoesch company, and now belongs to the company Rheinkalk.\nFor the 650th anniversary in 2003 the castle and the adjoining buildings were renovated.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe origin of the name Klusenstein isn't fully known. While the second part stein simply means rock, the word Kluse may either refer to a rift in the rock, or alternatively from the dialect word for or hermitage.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe castle is located on a 60m high cliff over the H\u00f6nne river valley, at around the narrowest part of the valley. At the bottom of the rock is a small cave in total 51m long. One corridor bends upward, but about 30m below the plateau it is blocked by stones. There were legends about a secret escapeway of the castle, in 2003 the top entrance to the cave was found below the eastern palais destroyed in 1840.\nBelow the castle is a mill, however though named Klusenstein mill it did not belong to castle. Since 1912 the railway connecting Balve and Menden runs directly below the castle.\n\n\n== References ==\n650 Jahre Burg Klusenstein. Heimatbund M\u00e4rkischer Kreis. ISBN 3-926890-26-6",

            "content": "The Uniform Debt-Management Services Act was promulgated in 2005 by the Uniform Law Commissioners. It provides the states with a comprehensive act governing national administration of debt counseling and management in a fair and effective way.\nConsumer debt counseling and management services have been available to individuals with serious credit problems going back to the 1950s. There are generally two kinds of services that have been available. Some of these services have provided counseling coupled with assisting debtors in establishing programs to pay off debts over an extended time. Others have provided consolidation and management services, in which agreements are reached with creditors to settle on a percentage of debt. Most of these services have collected a periodic amount from the debtors from which payment to creditors has been made. The general objective of these services has been debt satisfaction without resort to bankruptcy.\nThe history of debt counseling and management services is checkered. There have been numerous abuses and efforts to counter abuses statutorily in many states. These services have been criticized for their efforts to steer debtors away from bankruptcy when it may have been more advantageous and less costly to debtors to file. Many states prohibit for-profit debt management services while permitting nonprofit debt counseling services. One of the continuing controversies is whether for profit services should be allowed even if regulated.\nHowever, federal bankruptcy reform effective in 2005 has changed the perspective on such services. For an individual to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, that individual will in most cases have to show that consumer debt counseling/management has been sought and attempted. This shifts a highly significant burden upon private services to perform honestly and effectively. Because the new bankruptcy rules are federal and apply in every state, regulating the counseling and management services in every state must be uniform in character for the new bankruptcy rules to be effective and for consumers to be protected.\nIn 2005, just in time for consideration in the state legislatures, the Uniform Law Commissioners promulgated the Uniform Debt-Management Services Act (UDMSA). It provides the states with a comprehensive act governing these services that will mean national administration of debt counseling and management in a fair and effective way.\nIn March 2008, several important amendments [1] were made to the UDMSA. With these amendments, more than 20 states are executed to introduce the act in 2009.\nUDMSA may be divided into three basic parts: registration of services, service-debtor agreements and enforcement. Each part contributes to the comprehensive quality of the Uniform Act.\nRegistration\nNo service may enter into an agreement with any debtor in a state without registering as a consumer debt-management service in that state. Registration requires submission of detailed information concerning the service, including its financial condition, the identity of principals, locations at which service will be offered, form for agreements with debtors and business history in other jurisdictions. To register, a service must have an effective insurance policy against fraud, dishonesty, theft and the like in an amount no less than $250,000.00. It must also provide a security bond of a minimum of $50,000.00 which has the state administrator as a beneficiary. If a registration substantially duplicates one in another state, the service may offer proof of registration in that other state to satisfy the registration requirements in a state. A satisfactory application will result in a certificate to do business from the administrator. A yearly renewal is required.\nAgreements\nIn order to enter into agreements with debtors, there is a disclosure requirement respecting fees and services to be offered, and the risks and benefits of entering into such a contract. The service must offer counseling services from a certified counselor and a plan must be created in consultation by the counselor for debt-management service to commence. The contents of the agreements and fees that may be charged are set by the statute. There is a penalty-free three-day right of rescission on the part of the debtor. The debtor may cancel the agreement also after 30 days, but may be subject to fees if that occurs. The service may terminate the agreement if required payments are delinquent for at least 60 days.\nAny payments for creditors received from a debtor must be kept in a trust account that may not be used to hold any other funds of the service. There are strict accounting requirements and periodic reporting requirements respecting funds held.\nWith respect to debt settlement services, the UDMSA provides for an overall fee cap based on the amount saved by the consumer (30% of the difference between the principal amount owed upon initiation of the service and the amount the debt is ultimately settled for).\nEnforcement\nThe Act prohibits specific acts on the part of a service including: misappropriation of funds in trust; settlement for more than 50% of a debt with a creditor without a debtor\u2019s consent; gifts or premiums to enter into an agreement; and representation that settlement has occurred without certification from a creditor. Enforcement of the Uniform Act occurs at two levels, the administrator and the individual level. The administrator has investigative powers, power to order an individual to cease and desist; power to assess a civil penalty up to $10,000.00, and the power to bring a civil action. An individual may bring a civil action for compensatory damages, including triple damages if a service obtains payments not authorized in the Uniform Act, and may seek punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees. A service has a good faith mistake defense against liability. The statute of limitations pertaining to an action by the administrator is four years, and two years for a private right of action.\nBanks as regulated entities under other law are not subject to the Uniform Act, as are other kinds of activities that are incidental to other functions performed. For example, a title insurer that provides bill-paying service that is incidental to title insurance is not subject to it.\nUDMSA provides comprehensive regulation of debt counseling and management services. It becomes an essential part of the law of creditor and debtor as bankruptcy reform enacted by Congress in 2005 takes effect.\n\n\n== UDMSA & Debt Settlement Trade Associations ==\nDue to the rise of debt settlement as a debt relief alternative to bankruptcy, groups working in the industry established trade associations to help secure industry standards that will protect consumers against unethical business practices. These trade associations were also established to lobby state governments to adopt the recommendations of the UDMSA. The two major trade associations are the United States Organization for Bankruptcy Alternatives (USOBA) [2], and The Association of Settlement Companies (TASC) [3].\nThese organizations publish on their websites information about the UDMSA, debt settlement and the debt settlement industry.\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) (Drafters of UDMSA)\nInternational Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA) (Professional Perspective)\nOfficial website of Uniform Debt Management Services Act (UDMSA)\nUnited States Organization for Bankruptcy Alternatives (USOBA)\nThe Association of Debt Settlement Companies (TASC)",

            "content": "Interstate 44 (I-44) in the U.S. state of Missouri runs northeast from the Oklahoma state line near Joplin to I-70 in downtown St. Louis. It runs for about 293 miles (472 km) in the state.\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\nInterstate 44 enters Missouri in Newton County at the eastern terminus of the Will Rogers Turnpike, 200 yards south of the Kansas state line. The first interchange in Missouri is the eastern terminus of both U.S. Highway 166 and U.S. Highway 400. This highway next goes through southern Joplin and then begins a concurrency with Interstate 49/U.S. Highway 71 at Exit 11 just after entering Jasper County. The freeway turns to a more easterly heading (the old route of US 166), and then I-49/U.S. 71 splits off to the north at Exit 18.\nI-44 next enters Lawrence County. Near Mount Vernon, the highway curves to the northeast. The section of highway to Halltown is a completely new highway, not supplanting any previous highways. At Halltown, the road curves back to due east, beginning to follow the general pathway of old U.S. Highway 66, which it does all the way to downtown St. Louis. I-44 then goes around the western and northern sides of Springfield, serving as the western terminus of the James River Freeway, as well as crossing both Route 13 and U.S. Highway 65. The Interstate Highway continues northeast, bypassing Lebanon.\nIn Pulaski County, I-44 enters the Mark Twain National Forest, and then leaves it to provide access to Waynesville, St. Robert, and Fort Leonard Wood, before re-entering the national forest. The freeway leaves the forest in Phelps County west of Rolla. I-44 then goes through Rolla, where it meets U.S. Highway 63. It continues its northeast course, passing near St. James, Cuba, Bourbon, Sullivan, and Saint Clair.\n\nI-44 next goes north of Pacific before moving into St. Louis County. I-44 then bisects Eureka before serving as the southern boundary of Route 66 State Park (the former site of Times Beach, known for its dioxin contamination and its eventual demolition and Superfund cleanup). I-44 then runs across unincorporated land before entering Fenton and having an interchange with Interstate 270 in Sunset Hills. I-44 then goes through Crestwood, Kirkwood, Oakland, Webster Groves, and Shrewsbury before entering the City of St. Louis. I-44 runs on a due east course through St. Louis until it meets Interstate 55 south of downtown. The two highways run concurrently for about two miles until I-55 turns east to cross the Mississippi River on the Poplar Street Bridge. I-44 then continues north through Downtown St. Louis on the former route of Interstate 70 to its junction with that highway at the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nI-44 follows the general route of, and completely replaced, historic U.S. Route 66 from Halltown (exit 58, the junction with a cut-off section of US 66 since renumbered as Route 96) to downtown St. Louis. From rural Joplin at exit 15 to Mount Vernon at exit 49, it largely follows a decommissioned section of U.S. Route 166.\nA section of I-44 was moved slightly north between Powellville and Doolittle in 2005. The old alignment of the double-carriageway US 66 has since been demolished with the roadbed largely overgrown with vegetation, though evidence of the old alignment remains visible at both ends of the project. As of April 2006, the rocks That were carved away for the new roadbed virtually had no lichen, reflecting that this construction occurred rather recently. \nThe eastern terminus of I-44 was changed when the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge opened in February 2014, rerouting I-70 over the river along a more northern alignment. I-44 now takes the old I-70 alignment through the below-grade section of roadway in St. Louis, making the new eastern terminus a merging interchange with I-70 near Cass Avenue. The eastbound lanes of I-44 join the westbound lanes of I-70, and the westbound lanes of I-44 branch off the eastbound lanes of I-70.\n\n\n== Business loops ==\n\nAll of Interstate 44's business loops are in Missouri. Most of these Business Loops were the former U.S. Route 66. Missouri also has the unusual occurrence of a business loop and business spur from the same interstate intersecting (the Waynesville-St. Robert loop and the Ft. Leonard Wood spur).\n\n\n== Exit list ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Cigna is an American worldwide health services organization based in suburban Hartford, Connecticut. Its insurance subsidiaries are major providers of medical, dental, disability, life and accident insurance and related products and services, the majority of which are offered through employers and other groups (e.g. governmental and non-governmental organizations, unions and associations).\nCigna offers Medicare and Medicaid products and health, life and accident insurance coverages primarily to individuals in the U.S. and selected international markets. In addition to its ongoing operations described above, Cigna also has certain run-off operations, including a Run-off Reinsurance segment. In the Phoenix metropolitan area, Cigna runs a full-service staff-model HMO (health maintenance organization) with satellite clinics throughout the region, known as the Cigna Medical Group.\nCigna Global Health Benefits also operates under the Cigna corporation. Their tag line is 'Together, all the way.'\n\n\n== History ==\nCigna was formed by the 1982 merger of the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (CG) and INA Corporation (the parent corporation of Insurance Company of North America, the first stock insurance company in America). Insurance Company of North America was formed in 1792 and is therefore a corporate ancestor of Cigna. The CG was created in 1865 by a special act of the Governor of Connecticut. In October 1871, the great Chicago Fire burned for two days, destroyed 2,000 acres and left 100,000 people in Illinois homeless. INA paid $650,000, one of only 51 insurance companies (out of a total of 202) to pay claims in full.\nBefore selling its domestic and international property and casualty business to the Bermuda-based ACE Insurance company in the late 1990s, Cigna was among the companies with a large international network comparable to those of AIG, Allianz, and Zurich. The strategy behind the sale was to concentrate on core business. ACE \u2013 at that time a key player at the Bermuda and Lloyds insurance market \u2013 on the other hand was interested on expanding the international network in the traditional insurance market.\nCigna sold the majority of its life insurance operations to Lincoln National Corporation in 1997. Cigna now operates in 30 countries, has approximately 35,800 employees and manages around US$53.734 billion in assets.\nIn 2002, it was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act for earnings manipulation. Its common stock price plummeted significantly as a result. In October 2011, Cigna agreed to buy HealthSpring Inc. for $3.8 billion to jump-start its business selling Medicare plans from 46,000 Medicare Advantage members to almost 400,000 Medicare Advantage members. The payment would come from an issue of new equity to cover about 20 percent of the value, with the rest funded by additional cash and debt.\nIn June 2015, U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc. announced an offer to acquire Cigna for more than $47 billion in cash and stock. Anthem confirmed it had reached a deal to buy Cigna on July 24, 2015. On July 21, 2016, the US Justice Department filed an antitrust suit to block the proposed merger, and a District Court ruling on February 8, 2017 blocked the merger on anticompetitive grounds. That month, Cigna Corp. called off its $48 billion merger agreement with Anthem Inc., with Anthem stating it would \"continue to enforce its rights under the merger agreement and remains committed to closing the transaction.\"\n\n\n== Cigna Global Health Benefits ==\nCigna Global Health Benefits is a business unit within Cigna. The company is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, close to Philadelphia. Additional Cigna Global Health Benefits operations are located in Visalia, California, and Greenock, Scotland and Shanghai, China and Antwerp, Belgium. Sales offices are located in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\n\n=== Products and services ===\nCGHB global health plans typically include medical, dental, behavioral and disability, as well as business travel and life components. Expatriates are defined as employees of multinational companies working outside their home country on short, and long-term international assignments. CGHB maintains its own, in-house international claims platform, and offers a network of physicians and hospitals for its members (including 550,000 in the U.S. and more than 141,000 outside the U.S.).\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\nIn December 2007, Cigna was criticized after the company refused to pay for a liver transplant of a California teenage girl, Nataline Sarkisyan, justifying their refusal to pay by claiming that the procedure was experimental, even though there was a liver ready and waiting to be transplanted and doctors estimated she had a 65% chance of surviving at least six months. In response to much protest and public scrutiny, Cigna reversed its decision, though Ms. Sarkisyan died awaiting the transplant. Cigna notes that it had no financial stake in the decision to authorize the transplant because it merely administers the insurance plan of Mr. Sarkisyan's employer and would not bear the cost of any operation. However, Cigna offered to pay for the transplant itself when it made the exception to the policy.\nEven though liver transplants have been performed since 1963 and are a well accepted treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure, Cigna defended its actions by claiming that there was insufficient data to show that a transplant for a patient in Sarkisyan's condition would be safe and effective. The California court agreed with Cigna\u2019s position that the Sarkisyans\u2019 claims regarding Cigna's decision-making were preempted by federal ERISA law. On April 16, 2009, the United States District Court for the Central District of California dismissed all of the claims against Cigna related to the coverage determination.\nIn 2011, the California Nurses Association determined that Cigna denies roughly 39.6% of all claims (compared to competitors such as Aetna who denied about 5.9% of all claims in the same time frame).\nIn August 2012, Cigna fought and lost their argument in court that ABA therapy for autistic children is \"experimental\". The courts decided the therapy is a known treatment for autistic children, and Cigna\u2019s arguments had no merit. As of 2011, Cigna was fighting to have this decision reversed.\n\n\n== Accounting and investor relations ==\nOn February 9, 2005, CIGNA elected to adopt in the fourth quarter of 2004 fair value accounting for its stock options in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and to restate prior periods.\n\n\n== Public relations and lobbying ==\nThe UK newspaper Guardian in their Esc and Ctrl videoblog about control of the Internet by corporations, documented an incident with Nataline Sarkisyan and the former vice president of Cigna talking about astroturfing, the practice of creating fake blogs by interested groups, e.g. health insurance companies, to push claims that are profitable for said company into media, e.g. dismissing universal health care.\nCigna spent more than $4.4 million from 2005 to 2009 on lobbying to attain legislation that the company favors. This includes $720,000 spent in 2009 alone, when it had 20 lobbyists at five firms working on their behalf.\nIn 2008, the head of Cigna's public relations, Wendell Potter, resigned, becoming a whistleblower who gave testimony in 2009 to the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation in favor of reform of the health care industry.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nCigna received gold in the 2009 Gartner & 1to1 Customer Experience Excellence Award. The awards are given to the companies that \"most clearly demonstrate exemplary customer relationship strategy and an unrivaled level of excellence in delivering the customer experience\".\nIn January 2010, Cigna received the JD Power award for customer service for all of its call centers for the fourth time in a row.\n\n\n== Community and civic affairs and charitable giving ==\nIn 2008, the Cigna Foundation contributed $2,533,535 to charitable activities that promote wellness. Since 1995, Cigna and its employees have contributed $22.3 million to the March of Dimes.\nIn July 2010, Cigna began giving each company employee eight hours of paid time off annually to volunteer with non-profit health and community service organizations. The Salvation Army of Greater Philadelphia helped kick off the program in front of Cigna's Philadelphia headquarters with the Christmas in July campaign.\n\n\n== Strategic alliances ==\nOn April 16, 2010, Cigna announced an alliance with Humana group to offer a streamlined Medicare Advantage offering through employer clients for retirees.\nIn November 2011, Cigna and TTK Group, an Indian business conglomerate focused on healthcare, formed a joint venture called Cigna TTK to develop a health insurance business in India subject to obtaining government approvals.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of United States insurance companies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCigna website\n\nCigna Global Health Insurance\nWendell Potter - Former Cigna executive who resigned from Cigna in disgust",

            "content": "Capital XTRA (originally Choice FM) is a Global Radio-owned radio station that began broadcasting from London on 96.9 and 107.1 MHz in the FM band in 1990; alongside DAB Digital Radio, Freesat, Sky, Virgin Media and online nowadays. It is a radio station that exclusively broadcasts Urban, Hip Hop and R'n'B music.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nChoice 96.9 began as an independent company in March 1990, broadcasting from studios in Trinity Gardens, Brixton. It was Britain\u2019s first 24-hour black music radio station with a licence, covering South London. The group won a second licence (see Buzz FM) in 1995, bringing a local version of their London offering to Birmingham, on 102.2 FM - in place of Buzz FM.\nThe advent of digital radio in the UK saw Choice, which already had an active webstream, joining the new MXR consortium and launching a DAB service which anchored London output with news inserts produced by the consortium's news service DNN.\nThe Birmingham licence was sold to Chrysalis Radio in 1999 and became Galaxy Birmingham, but Choice expanded within the capital in May 2000 when a largely independent North London licence was awarded for Choice 107.1, with the intention of reaching a larger Afro-Caribbean audience outside the limited range of the coverage from Brixton. The station was now broadcasting from Borough High Street, Borough, London.\nHaving previously been a minority shareholder, Capital Radio Group took full control of the station in February 2004 and moved the station's base from the target service area to the group's central studios in London's Leicester Square. The move resulted in a community march from the coverage area and their studios. It was accused of selling out as some of their DJs were removed and replaced by their Kiss counterparts who play some electronic music.\nBy 12 October 2004, Capital had received and implemented a merger of their FM licences, operating a service across the capital on the two frequencies and cutting back on the North London-specific music requirements.\nThe DAB service also became a simulcast of the London station, with the demise of local drop-ins.\nFollowing their takeover of Choice, Capital Radio Group merged with GWR to form GCap Media in 2005. Choice was flagged up as one of the key brands of the new larger network, and the station was made available to digital TV viewers via its addition to Sky (and later to Virgin Media).\nGCap were subsequently taken over by Global Radio, who already owned the Galaxy Network of dance/urban music stations. Despite the separate music format and branding, Choice was marketed to advertisers as part of the Galaxy network for package advertising deals. In 2010 Global Radio announced that the Galaxy network stations would be networked with 95.8 Capital FM, leaving Choice as a standalone brand again.\nOn 3 October 2013, Global announced that Choice would be rebranded as Capital XTRA on 7 October.\nCapital XTRA reaches 1.5 million listeners across the UK.\n\n\n== Current notable presenters ==\nTim Westwood\nCraig David\nRas Kwame\nAbrantee Boateng\nToni Phillips\nRobert Bruce\nJay London\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of radio stations in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "Tom Fexas (1941 \u2013 November 29, 2006) was an innovative yacht designer who adopted a retro design from vintage commuter yachts of the 1930s to modern construction techniques. His design for Midnight Lace in 1978 helped launch a new movement that became known as Italian styling.\n\n\n== Early life and career ==\nGrowing up in Queens, New York, Fexas was inspired to become a yacht-designer after watching the boats come in at Long Island Sound, and by time he spent on his family's yacht. Starting at age 7, Fexas spent time drawing and painting designs of yachts, and after completing his secondary education decided to pursue a degree in marine engineering at SUNY Maritime College. Upon graduation, Fexas took a position on the SS Independence as its third engineer, and finished the yacht design program from the Westlawn Institute of Marine Technology during the voyage. After returning from the Independence in 1965, Fexas moved to Mystic, Connecticut and took a position at General Dynamics Electric Boat designing submarines, while working on yacht design after work hours.\n\n\n== Midnight Lace and following career ==\nFexas opened his own yacht design company, Tom Fexas Yacht Design, while continuing to work at Electric Boat on Ohio-class submarines. Fexas quit his Electric Boat position in 1972 (some sources list 1977) and dedicated his time towards designing the Midnight Lace, which was noticed and ordered by a client several years later. Upon completion of the Midnight Lace, Fexas moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where his yacht premiered at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show in 1978. The low profile, black boat was complimented for its use of wood (as opposed to most other yachts of that era) and its resemblance to older craft of the 1930s and 1940s, and the style became known as Italian styling.\nAfter Fexas became notable for his work on Midnight Lace, he went into production with Chinese boat maker Cheoy Lee, and also worked with builders like Mikelson Yachts and Abeking & Rasmussen. He wrote articles for several magazines, and became the editor of (and monthly writer for) Power and Motoryacht in 1985, a position he held until 2003. Fexas also spent several years as a member of the Westlake Board of Directors, while continuing to run his yacht design company. Due to popular demand, Fexas redesigned Midnight Lace in 2003, and started work on constructing a new model before his death in 2006. His yacht design company was then run by his wife, Regina Fexas, and other former students of the Westlawn design course, until the luxury yacht market collapsed during the worldwide recession and Tom Fexas Yacht Designs was forced to close after 30 years in the business.\n\n\n== References ==",

He then joined British Aerospace at Filton, Bristol (now Airbus), before leaving in 1984 to join March Engineering. He was there until the end of 1990, the last three years being with the March-Leyton House Formula One team as race engineer.\nIn 1991, Brown joined Brabham as Chief Race Engineer with primary responsibility for Martin Brundle's car. Brown left the world of Formula One to join Galmer Engineering as Assistant Technical Director. In 1992 they won the Indy 500 with a car of their own design. \nBrown later became a founding member and Chief Engineer for PacWest Racing, where they set a new closed course world record of 240.9 mph (387.7 km/h) at Fontana, California in 1997. Following this he joined Panther Racing as Chief Engineer for the 1999 season subsequently winning back-to-back Indy Racing League series championships in 2001 and 2002.\nBrown left Panther Racing at the end of 2005 to join Chip Ganassi Racing as race engineer for the No. 10 Target Honda-powered Dallara driven by 2005 IndyCar Series and Indianapolis 500 champion Dan Wheldon.  He stepped back from race engineering for the 2008 season to concentrate on R&D work, mainly aerodynamics.\nFor 2011, Brown returned to the UK and created ACBC Ltd., but with his Indycar background most of the company's business interests are naturally still in the USA, the main customers being Chip Ganassi Racing and Honda Performance Development. But with a shortage of such specialised knowledge in the UK, media work, reporting on Indycar activities, has been forthcoming for both Magazines and Television.\n\n\n== Notes ==",

It is much more prominent, in both a general and topographic sense, than many Munros, but because it is under 3000 feet and in a geographically isolated area, it is relatively infrequently climbed. Like other summits in the Ardgour area, it has been cited by those who deride the obsession with Munro bagging. From the summit, there are extensive views east to Ben Nevis and the mountains of Glen Coe, and west to several islands.\n\n\n== Ascents ==\nThere are several possible routes of ascent. All of them are steep and likely to require scrambling in places. Although most present no technical difficulties in good conditions, careful route finding may be required when descending from the main summit, especially in mist. Most approaches start at the old bridge at the foot of its south east ridge, where there is parking space. From there, the best route of ascent may be up the crest of the ridge, or via a path to the north of this ridge and then up to the saddle between the main summit and its south east top. There are no constructed paths up or onto the ridge, but the boots of successive climbers have created steps which show and facilitate the way in some places, but disappear or are creating erosion in others.\n\n\n== References ==\nThe Corbetts and Other Scottish Hills, (SMC Guide) ISBN 0-907521-71-1\nWalkhighlands\nWalk in Scotland (archived)\nOutdoors Magic (archived)",

It contains 14 buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated listed buildings, all of which are at Grade II. This grade is the lowest of the three gradings given to listed buildings and is applied to \"buildings of national importance and special interest\". The parish contains the village of Aston, but is otherwise almost completely rural, and its listed buildings reflect this, including farmhouses and other houses. The Shropshire Union Canal runs through the parish, and there are two listed buildings associated with this, a bridge and a milepost. Also listed are a boundary stone, a telephone kiosk, and a lychgate.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCitations\n\nSources",

            "content": "The Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 had devastated the shore around Prince William Sound, diminishing the marine population. Consequently, the fishery industry in the area faced a sharp fall on their fish catch and revenue. Feeling little had been done to study the impact of the spill, a group of fishermen sailed off to begin a blockade of the Valdez Narrows on August 20, 1993. While tankers must pass through Valdez Narrows to enter the port of Valdez, seven tankers were held off in the three-day blockade.\nAs oil was continuing to pump through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, and tankers were keeping off shore, the storage tanks in Valdez would soon overflow. With the probability in interrupting the oil flow to prevent an overflow, and also facing a growing loss in profits, the government came in to settle the blockade. The blockade was called off after Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt promised to release $5 million of the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill restoration funds for ecosystem-wide studies.\nComprehensive studies of the effects of the spill toward the ecosystem around Prince William Sound began in the following year.\n\n\n== References ==\nTanker Blockade Ends Hugh Curran.

            "content": "Katharina \"Kathinka\" von Oheimb, n\u00e9e van Endert (January 2, 1879 in Neuss; March 22, 1962 in D\u00fcsseldorf) was a German politician, publisher, and salonni\u00e8re.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nFrom 1920 to 1924 Katharina von Oheimb was one of the 36 women amongst the 466 representatives of the 1. Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. Despite being a member of the national liberal German People's Party she tended toward socialist beliefs. Until 1931, she was entitled as the secretary of the Pro Palestine Committee.\nDuring the Weimar Republic, she hosted one of the most significant political salons in Berlin. Bankers and industrialists, ministers, military personnel, and artists socialized at her house at Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (1919-1926) and later in her new apartment at Matth\u00e4ikirchstreet 32. Her social and political engagement comprised a variety of activities and appointments, for instance her board membership of the East Prussia Relief. She took custodianship of illegitimate children and supported orphans. She was a friend of campaigner for women's rights Minna von Caurer, with whom she founded the \"Bund for Mutterschutz\" (League for Maternity Protection) together with sex educator Helene St\u00f6cker. In 1922, she started educational courses for women hoping to prepare them for their rather new suffrage and opportunities to run for political office. Amongst the invited speakers were Gustav Stresemann and Clara Mende. As a result of her visibility in society and her turbulent private life, journalist and author Kurt Tucholsky addressed her in his derogative toned poem \"An Frau von Oheimb\" in 1930.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKatharina von Oheimb was the daughter of the furniture and silk goods manufacturer Rudolf van Endert. After his death in 1881, her mother Elisabeth continued the proceedings. Katharina's brothers\u2013Josef and Rudolf\u2013later entered the business.\nKatharina von Oheimb was married four times. At age 19, she married the industrialist Felix Daelen who founded the \"Glyco-Metallwerke\". They had three children together, however, the fourth child Paul-Felix, born in the time of their marriage, was fathered by her second husband. Nevertheless, Paul-Felix later became director of Glyco factory. She and her husband divorced in 1905, after Katharina had left the family. Her second husband, Ernst Albert, was the son of industrialist Heinrich Albert. Their daughter Elisabeth's second husband was conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler making Katharina von Oheimb the grandmother of actress Kathrin Ackermann and great-grandmother of actress Maria Furtw\u00e4ngler. Albert died in 1911, after a mountaineering accident in Tyrol. Katharina continued the business of his ceramic factory and got married to Albert's best friend, and owner of a manor, Hans Joachim von Oheimb. They divorced in 1921. In 1927, she married her former parliamentary colleague Siegfried von Kardoff, who ran for second vice president of the Reichstag.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKatharina von Oheimb in Database of Members of the German Parliament\nKatharina von Oheimb in Database of German Biographies",

            "content": "Selma Fraiberg (1918\u20131981) was a child psychoanalyst, author and social worker. She studied infants with congenital blindness in the 1970s. She found that blind babies had three problems to overcome: learning to recognize parents from sound alone, learning about permanence of objects, acquiring a typical or healthy self-image. She also found that vision acts as a way of pulling other sensory modalities together and without sight babies are delayed. In addition to her work with blind babies, she also was one of the founders of the field of infant mental health and developed mental health treatment approaches for infants, toddlers and their families. Her work on intergenerational transmission of trauma such as described in her landmark paper entitled \"Ghosts in the Nursery\" has had an important influence on the work of living psychoanalysts and clinical researchers such as Alicia Lieberman and Daniel Schechter Her seminal contribution to childhood development, \"The Magic Years\", is still in use by students of childhood development and early childhood education throughout the United States. The Magic Years, which deals with early childhood and has been translated into 11 languages, was written when she was teaching at the Tulane Medical School in New Orleans.\nAt the time of her death, Selma Fraiberg was a professor of child psychoanalysis at the University of California, San Francisco and a clinician who devoted her career to helping troubled children. She was also professor emeritus of child psychoanalysis at the University of Michigan Medical School, where she had taught from 1963 to 1979, and had also been director of the Child Developmental Project in Washtenaw County, Mich., for children with emotional problems.\nFraiberg's work is said to have paralleled that of Anna Freud, a pioneer in child psychoanalysis. Both were keenly interested in young blind people. For 15 years Professor Fraiberg studied the development of children who were blind from birth, and this led to her writing Insights From the Blind: Comparative Studies of Blind and Sighted Infants, published in 1977. In the same year, she wrote Every Child's Birthright: In Defense of Mothering, a study of the early mother-child relationship in which she argued that all subsequent development is based on the quality of the child's first attachments.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSelma Fraiberg was born Selma Horowitz on March 8, 1918 in Detroit, Michigan. Her mother was Dorella Horowitz and her father was Jack Horowitz. Jack Horowitz took over the family poultry business, while Dorella was a stay at home mother. In 1945, she married Professor and author Dr. Louis Fraiberg, who she met while studying at Wayne State University. The Fraibergs had a daughter, Lisa in 1956. In 1979 the Fraibergs moved to San Francisco. In August 1981, Fraiberg was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. She died four months later on December 19, 1981 at the age of 63.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nSelma Fraiberg graduated from Wayne State University with a master's degree in social work in 1940. She then went to the Detroit Psychoanalytic Institute to completer her psychoanalytic training. From 1963 to 1979 she was the professor of psychoanalysis at the University of Michigan. During this time she was also the director of the Child Development Project. After moving to San Francisco Selma became the director of an infant-parent program at the San Francisco General Hospital.\nAuthor of several influential psychoanalytic texts such as: The Magic Years and Clinical Studies in Infant Mental Health\n\n\n== Contributions ==\n\n\n=== Infant blindness studies ===\nSelma Fraiberg's research revolved around discovering the effects of visual deprivation in infants. Particularly, she wanted to look at the effects blindness had on ego development and organization of experience in infants. One infant that was studied by Fraiberg contributed to two new findings. The infant, Toni, was considered normal blind, as defined by Fraiberg. Prior to these findings it had been believed that an infant smiling response would only result from visual stimulus of a human. However, this was overturned when Toni would smile after hearing her mother's voice. A second new finding was related to stranger anxiety. Stranger anxiety had been thought to only be an effect of a visual distinction between a known face and an unknown face. This was also questioned when Toni would not smile in response to hearing a voice of anyone except her mother around the age of eight months old.\nFraiberg also distinguished the importance of a blind infant's mouth as a replacement to their deficiency in visual stimulus. She noted that blind infants use their mouth as a way to perceive the world much longer than non-blind infants. Tactile perception is important to developing the difference between the inner and outer self. Since blind infants lack visual perceptions, they rely on their mouth for perceiving the world well into their second year of life. This results in failure of differentiating between the self and non-self in blind infants at a normal age.\n\n\n=== Mental health treatment for children ===\nSelma Fraiberg not only researched blindness in infants, but also was a part of developing new techniques for mental health treatment of young children. One technique she proposed was called \"kitchen table therapy.\" In kitchen table therapy, Fraiberg would go into the homes of parents with young children, typically under the age of two. There are three different approaches to kitchen table therapy. They are brief crisis intervention, developmental guidance-support treatment, and infant-parent psychotherapy. Each type of therapy is used for different situations, depending on where Fraiberg or her colleagues thought the problems in the parent/child development relationship were stemming from. Brief crisis intervention was used when there was few, specific, situational events that resulted in a lack of helping the child develop. Developmental guidance-support treatment is used in situations where the baby may have a chronic illness or disorder and the parents are struggling to find a way to move beyond that problem. This therapy technique is used when parents are still capable of being good parents, but simply need assistance in how to practice that. Infant-parent psychotherapy is used when the parents have their own struggles from their past which prevent them from developing an attachment with their child. The main goal of this technique is to rid the parents of their problem so it does not transfer onto the child. The purpose of these three types of therapy is to prevent development and attachment delays in children. These therapy techniques combine psychoanalysis, psychiatry, and social work practices to help parents and children establish foundations for development and attachment in the child's first few years of life.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nFraiberg developed a new technique to approach infant and parent treatment. This approach for developing infant relationships with their parents until the age of two brought the treatment into the home and is still used today. Her practice was the start of infant mental health development and is still being used today, only with small adjustments and modifications to account for changing urban and rural lifestyles. Fraiberg's new approach to infant mental health was different than current approaches of her time. However, they continue to be the building blocks of infant mental health today.\nFraiberg's concept of \"ghosts\" in her infant mental health studies is still prominent in infant theories and studies today. In her paper \"Ghosts in the Nursery,\" Fraiberg said problems in infant development and attachment stem from the ghosts of their parents. The unremembered ghosts prevent parents from fully developing a deep attachment with their child that is important to their development. This concept of ghosts is used as a function of psychotherapy. The function is helping the subject leave their ghosts behind and continue moving forward with their life.\n\n\n== References ==",

This method is very useful because of its simplicity. It permits easy monitoring of the amount of dialysis therapy delivered to individual patients, as well as across dialysis units, groups of units, states, regions, or countries, because monthly predialysis and postdialysis urea nitrogen values are routinely measured. It also permits quality control and improvement initiatives and regulatory oversight. The United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) publishes annual data regarding the URR values being delivered to dialysis patients across the United States. The ESRD networks monitor therapy across groups of states. The European Renal Association (ERA-EDTA) Registry covers most European countries, and DOPPS (Dialysis Outcomes Practice Patterns Study) records and analyzes URR and other data from selected dialysis units located in countries across the world.\n\n\n== Relation to Kt/V ==\nMathematically, the URR is closely related to Kt/V, and the two quantities can be derived from another with more or less precision, depending on the amount of additional information available about a given dialysis session.\nKt/V is one of the reference methods by which the amount of dialysis given is measured. Kt/V, like the URR, focuses on urea as the target solute, and is based on the assumption that removal of urea is from a single space - urea distribution volume, or \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V\\,}\n   similar in capacity to the total body water.

Both of these factors make the actual post-dialysis serum urea level higher than expected, and the URR lower than expected, when the extremely simplified equation above, is used.\nA more accurate relationship between URR and Kt/V can be derived by single-pool, variable volume urea kinetic modeling. A simplified estimating equation also can be used. This gives results that are quite similar to formal urea modeling as long as dialysis treatments of 2\u20136 hours in duration are given, and Kt/V is between 0.7 and 2.0.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              K\n              \u22c5\n              t\n            \n            V\n          \n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        l\n        n\n        (\n        (\n        1\n        \u2212\n        U\n        R\n        R\n        )\n        \u2212\n        0.008\n        \u22c5\n        t\n        )\n        +\n        (\n        4\n        \u2212\n        3.5\n        (\n        1\n        \u2212\n        U\n        R\n        R\n        )\n        )\n        \u22c5\n        \n          \n            \n              0.55\n              \u22c5\n              U\n              F\n            \n            V\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {K\\cdot t}{V}}=-ln((1-URR)-0.008\\cdot t)+(4-3.5(1-URR))\\cdot {\\frac {0.55\\cdot UF}{V}}}\n  \nThe \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        0.008\n        \u22c5\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (0.008\\cdot t)}\n   term is a function of the dialysis session duration (t), and adjusts for the amount of urea generated during the dialysis session.

To use the nomogram, one needs to know the postdialysis weight (W) as well as the amount of weight (fluid) loss during the dialysis session (UF). First, find the URR on the vertical axis, then move over to the proper isopleth (curved line) depending on the amount of weight lost during dialysis (UF/W). Then drop down to the horizontal axis to read off the Kt/V value:\n\n\n== Limitations of URR vs. Kt/V ==\nThe URR is designed to measure the amount of dialysis given when the dialysis clearance of urea greatly exceeds the urea generation rate. In continuous hemodialysis or in peritoneal dialysis, for example, a considerable amount of dialysis is delivered, but the urea level remains roughly constant after the initial treatment of uremia, so the URR is essentially zero. In long slow overnight dialysis, if simplified equations are used, the URR also underestimates the amount of dialysis due to urea generation during the long dialytic session. For this reason, the kinetically modeled Kt/V is always recommended as the best measure of dialysis adequacy. The Kt/V, even that derived by formal modeling, is primarily based on the URR, and so it contains little additional information in terms of the amount of dialysis that was delivered. Since the URR and Kt/V are so closely related, their predictive power in terms of patient outcome is similar. However, use of Kt/V and urea modeling in general allows for comparing expected with predicted dose of dialysis, which can be used to analyze dialysis treatments and dialyzer clearances and in troubleshooting and quality control activities. Also, Kt/V permits calculation of the urea generation rate, which can give clues about a patient's protein intake.\n\n\n== Minimally adequate dose in terms of URR ==\nIn the standard 3x/week hemodialysis schedule a URR of 65% is considered the minimum acceptable dose, corresponding to a minimum Kt/V of 1.2  When dialysis is given more frequently than three times a week, the minimum acceptable URR is lower; because more dialysis treatments are given over the week, the dose of dialysis for each treatment does not need to be as large. Also minimally acceptable values for URR (and Kt/V) can be reduced in patients who have substantial amounts of residual renal function.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHemodialysis Dose and Adequacy - a description of URR and Kt/V from the Kidney and Urologic Diseases Clearinghouse.\n\n\n=== Calculators ===\nKt/V calculator - (estimating equation) Medindia\nKt/V calculator - (Full kinetic model) hdcn.com",

            "content": "The Churches of Christ in Australia is a Christian movement in Australia. It is part of the Restoration Movement with historical influences from the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\nThe Churches of Christ in Australia are made up of State Conferences which are an association of independent churches who choose to relate at a state and national level. Within this conference structure, individual churches are largely autonomous and operate on a congregational and democratic form of government. Leadership varies in local churches and where there are ministers or pastor they may or may not be formally ordained. Lay people usually play an important part in the worship, mission, governance and management of the church.\nKey features of the church's worship are the weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper presided over by a lay person and believer's baptism. This Christian movement claims to \"concentrate on the essential aspects of the Christian faith, allowing for a diversity of understanding with non-essentials.\"  It is active in community services and supporting Christian unity, although this emphasis was stronger historically.\nChurches of Christ is one of the smaller Christian groups by affiliation in Australia. The 2001 Census showed 61,335 identifying, falling to 49,687 in the 2011 Census, which represents 0.2% of the population. This is compared with 61.1% of Australians who indicated religious affiliation with any Christian denomination. The National Church Life Survey 2001 showed that Churches of Christ had the highest attendance-to-affiliation percentage. This survey showed a regular estimated attendance of 45,100 (74%). Average weekly attendance figures in 2013 were 38 500, although a larger number of people would be expected to have a connection to a Church of Christ.\n\n\n== Worship and devotion ==\nKey features are the weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper presided over by a lay person and a commitment to believer's baptism.\n\n\n== Ministry and mission ==\nThe church is active in community services and the ecumenical movement.\nNational cooperative ministries include Global Mission Partners (formerly the Australian Churches of Christ Overseas Mission Board), Stirling Theological College, Indigenous Ministries Australia, the Defence Force Chaplains Committee, and Youth Vision Australia.\n\n\n== Theology and values ==\nThe denomination claims to \"concentrate on the essential aspects of the Christian faith, allowing for a diversity of understanding with non-essentials.\"\nTheological education and formation occurs at the:\nStirling Theological College, located in Mulgrave in south-east Melbourne, is the movement's national theological college. Stirling is a College of the University of Divinity. Stirling was formerly known as the Churches of Christ Theological College and before that the College of the Bible. It has students completing coursework and research from across Australia and Asia.\nAustralian College of Ministries is owned by New South Wales Churches of Christ Conference, and provides training across Australia. Its courses are taught as part of the Sydney College of Divinity.\nOrdination, which is bestowed by the State Conferences, is open to both men and women.\n\n\n== History and heritage ==\nIt is part of the Restoration Movement with historical influences from the United States of America and the United Kingdom dating from the early 19th century. The Churches of Christ in Australia are more similar to the Christian Church in the United States (most Churches of Christ in the United States sing a capella, whereas most Churches of Christ in Australia use musical instruments, as does the Christian Church in the United States).\n\n\n=== Queensland ===\nA small group met in Albion, Brisbane in 1871, however it was not until 1 August 1882 that C.M. Fischer and T Geraghty established the first Church of Christ in Queensland at the Zillman Waterholes (now Zillmere, Queensland). The Ann Street Church of Christ was established in 1883  and moved into its present building in Brisbane's central business district in 1898.\n\n\n=== South Australia ===\nIn March 1839, Robert Lawrie and his fianc\u00e9e Margaret Mailey; Archibald Greenshields and Marion Greenshields (n\u00e9e Lawrie) and their daughter Jane aged 2; Thomas Neill and family; all of Kilmarnock and nearby Newmilns, applied on the same day with the same agent for free passage to South Australia, departing London 21 May 1839 on the ship Recovery and arriving in September 1839. In 1836, John Lawrie, older brother to the above-mentioned Lawries, had joined the Kilmarnock Scotch Baptist church, believing it to be the \u201ctrue\u201d church. But by 1837 John had become so influenced by the writings of Alexander Campbell that he commenced Disciples meetings at Newmilns. All the above had been influenced by the Restoration movement; the Lawries (including James) and the Greenshields accepting its Biblical teaching. The coming to South Australia was due to Andrew Warnock of Paisley. Warnock was a manufacturer, but like other businessmen in Glasgow he was keen to invest in the new free colony of South Australia. Property was purchased for his son John Warnock, but as he knew nothing about farming, James Lawrie and William Wilson were employed to establish it. They left aboard the ship Ariadne in April 1839. The journey was long and hazardous: there were 223 passengers crowded onto the ship, and apart from all the dangers of illness, of storms, of rounding the Cape of Good Hope, a fire broke out on ship. Finally, in August 1839 their party, which included more persons than those listed above, arrived and were given or attained positions in the colony.\nThomas Neill had been in business as a grocer in Kilmarnock and before that he had been a farm servant. It was intended that he should work on the Warnock property but on arrival it was discovered that the dry climate required many more acres to support a family than it did in Scotland. Fortunately for him he was immediately given a job as storekeeper with the South Australian Company by the manager, his old friend David McLaren. Neill had relations in Glasgow, Paisley and Kilmarnock. The Neills attended the Scotch Baptist church, built in Hindley Street by the Methodists then abandoned for their new building in Gawler Place. McLaren was the unofficial pastor, and later, Thomas, his wife Jean, and Agnes their daughter were listed as members in 1844 when the Scotch Baptists were meeting in Morphett Street.\nUpon arrival, James Lawrie went immediately south to Mertin Farm at Noarlunga; land that adjoins the Onkaparinga River. He was later joined by his brother Robert. William Wilson looked after another section of Mertin Farm. Another Scotch Baptist family from Glasgow arrived aboard Glenswilly in September 1839, the day before the Recovery. This was the Wauchope family, John, his wife and two sons, George and William. They settled on the property named Allandale in the Morphett Vale area. William worked for James and Robert on Mertin Farm. The major part of Mertin Farm lay not far below the Craig and Murray properties on the Onkaparinga River. In 1841 when David McLaren returned to England, the Adelaide congregation split over the question of \"open communion.\" A new group was formed at North Adelaide with Samuel Gill as minister. Alexander Murray with seven others were dismissed to form a church at Noarlunga.\nIt is probable that the Noarlunga group consisted of Alexander and Jane Murray; James and Janet Craig; Archibald and Marion Greenshields; Robert and Margaret Lawrie; James Lawrie and William Wilson. Most of the above were connected through family relationship. This group could very well have been the source of some of Campbell's writings referred to as being in the Adelaide Scotch Baptist congregation and perhaps originally coming from John Lawrie. In March 1841 John Warnock arrived aboard John Cooper from Greenock, to take over Mertin Farm. The Lawrie brothers worked for Warnock for a time while he settled into the management of the farm, then moved out. James Craig and Alexander Murray, Scotch Baptists from Glasgow, arrived with their families in the ship India, in February 1840. They moved on to properties south of Adelaide. In October 1840 Craig bought a second section not far from his home property and made arrangements for Archibald Greenshields to manage it.\nIn mid-1842 James Craig, caught in the financial crisis, was forced to sell the property that was managed by Greenshields. Greenshields became a labourer. Alexander Murray was able to survive for a time by accepting Robert Lawrie into joint occupancy of his property.\nAlthough the financial crisis of the colony had changed the fortunes of this little group, they managed, for a time, to remain in close proximity with each other. It is likely that the little southern congregation existed up until 1845 when Murray left for England and the Lawries shifted to Lonyunga in the Myponga Hills. It wasn't long after this that John Lawrie became concerned about the brethren \"scattered over the wild prairie.\" It was then that Lawrie persuaded his fellow elder, John Aird, to come to S.A. to take charge of the \"little flock\" in the south. John Aird and John Watson arrived in S.A. with their families on the ship Lady McNaughton/Lady MacNaghten, in October 1847. They met with the brethren at Franklin Street and then travelled to Noarlunga where Aird called his fellow restorationists together. They celebrated the Lord's Supper on October 31 and formed into a church on 7 November 1847.\nThomas Magarey arrived in South Australia via New Zealand in 1845. He moved to Noarlunga after he was married to Elizabeth Verco on 10 March 1848. He worked in the local flour mill at the Horseshoe and for the 18 months to two years they were at Noarlunga, worshipped with the little group of disciples led by John Aird. Others in the congregation were: Watsons, Browns, Greenshields, Robert Lawries and Scotts. At the beginning of 1850, two years later, the Magareys returned to Hindmarsh, where Magarey wrote glowingly of the time spent with John Aird and the church at McLaren Vale.\nAlexander Lawrie came to live in the Myponga Hills in 1851. In 1855 he married Jane Watson, daughter of John Watson. John Lawrie arrived in the Myponga Hills November 1853. His wife and family joined him in November 1855.\nThe church in the south had close links with the disciples in Adelaide. James Craig and John Brown represented the McLaren Vale church at the opening of the Hindmarsh church, 10 June 1855. Subscribers from the McLaren Vale church to the Grote Street building fund were: Aird, Brown, Craig, Jones, Greenshields, John Lawrie, Robert Lawrie, Watson, Scott. The Grote Street church building of the Christian Disciples was opened in December 1856. As a number of families lived in the Myponga Hills John Lawrie decided mid 1856 they should meet locally as the Willunga congregation.\nMembers of the Willunga church appointed as Trustees of the Grote Street church on 27 June 1856:- John Lawrie and James Craig. John pointed out difficulties of country members acting as Trustees and so at a meeting on August 30, 1856, the previous country appointments were cancelled and Adelaide members appointed in place of those from Willunga and Milang. Late in 1857, John, Robert, Alexander Lawrie and families, sold their properties and moved north to farm the land at Alma Plains. Archibald Greenshields followed 3 or 4 years later and the Aird family later still. A chapel was built at Alma Plains in 1862 which doubled as a school room. The chapel soon became too small and a new Christian Disciples chapel was built 10 years later. T. J. Gore of Norwood and John Lawrie of Alma conducted the opening services to a large congregation. The following Monday some three or four hundred gathered for tea, after which John Lawrie presided over a meeting at which some five hundred heard addresses by Kidner, Colbourne, Woolcock, and Gore.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe State Conferences are: Victoria and Tasmania, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory.\nThe Churches of Christ Provident Fund was established to support paid ministers. Most of its role has been handed over to the non-denominational Christian Super fund.\n\n\n== Affiliations ==\nMCD University of Divinity\nNational Council of Churches in Australia\nSydney College of Divinity\nWorld Convention of Churches of Christ\n\n\n== Other groups called Churches of Christ ==\nIn Australia there are at least four distinct groups known as \"Churches of Christ\". As well as this organisation, there are also the independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, the International Churches of Christ, and the non-denominational Churches of Christ.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlobal Mission Partners\nYouth Vision Australia\nNational Youth Ministry Convention\nThe Australian Christian\nNational Church Life Survey",
