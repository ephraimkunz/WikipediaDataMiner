Later they were allowed to found a new settlement, called Codacchio, later, when other refugees from Dragonara arrived, christened Terra Maioris (\"Major Land\"), the modern Torremaggiore. This burg was later a fief of the Counts (later Dukes) of Sangro. It was destroyed by an earthquake on July 30, 1627.\nOn 17 March 1862 a platoon of newly united Italy's royal troops was defeated by the brigands of Carmine Crocco; 21 soldiers were killed, even their captain Francesco Richard.\nFrom 25 August 1925, Torremaggiore was connected to the nearby San Severo by a tramway, the first in southern Italy.\n\n\n== Ecclesiastical history ==\nFiorentina was the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fiorentino, established in 1059, until its 1391 merger into the Diocese of Lucera, but was nominally restored as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric.\nThe municipality also includes Dragonara, episcopal see of the Diocese of Dragonara, another former medieval residential bishopric, established in 1039, merged into the Diocese of San Severo in 1580, and presently a separate Latin Catholic titular see.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nCastle of Fiorentino (11th century), place of death of Emperor Frederick II.\nCastle of Dragonara (11th century).\nThe Castle of the Dukes (originally Counts) of Sangro, built from a Norman tower, has maintained the Renaissance appearance. It includes four circular and two square towers, and a throne hall with a 17th-century fresco frieze. It is home to the archaeological exhibition of findings from Fiorentino.\nChiesa matrice di San Nicola (\"Mother Church of St. Nicholas\", 13th century), built by the refugees from Fiorentino and Dragonara, rebuilt in 1631 after the earthquake.\nChurch of Santa Maria della Strada (early 16th century).\nSanctuary of Santa Maria della Fontana.\nChurch of the Madonna di Loreto (16th century), erected by Albanian immigrants. It was rebuilt in 1627.\nChurch of Santa Maria degli Angeli (17th century).\n\n\n== Notable locals ==\nRogerius of Apulia (c.1205\u20131266), medieval Roman Catholic monk and chronicler\nLuigi Rossi (1597\u20131653), musician\nRaimondo di Sangro (1710\u20131771), prince and scientist\nNicola Fiani (1757\u20131799), patriot and radical, executed after the collapse of the Parthenopean Republic\nFortune Gallo (1878\u20131970), opera impresario\nNicola Sacco (1891\u20131927), anarchist, executed with Bartolomeo Vanzetti following a controversial American trial\n\n\n== Twinned cities ==\n Buffalo, NY, United States\n  Canosa di Puglia, Barletta-Andria-Trani, Apulia, Italy\n  Villafalletto, Cuneo, Piedmont, Italy\n\n\n== See also ==\nFoggia Airfield Complex, also known as Torremaggiore Airfield\nList of Catholic dioceses in Italy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources and external links ==\nGCatholic with residential and titular incumbent biography links",

It belongs to the Argentine-Chilean binational basin of the Baker River which drains into the Pacific Ocean. It has an important affluent, the Tarde River, and two others minor ones and it drains into Lake Pueyrred\u00f3n through a short river reach. Mean annual rainfall is 200 mm and annual temperature is 4.5 \u00b0C.\nLake Posadas, somewhat triangular in shape, has cliffs, ravines and volcanic tuffs with no plant cover on its northeastern slope. Towards its eastern end, open steppe shrubs prevail (Senecio spp, Schinus molle, Nassauvia ulicina) with Adesmia boronioides and scanty broom sedge (Andropogon argenteus). On its southern shore there are fluvio-glacial fans bordered by patches of thickets composed of \"duraznillo\" (Colliguaya integerrima), \"calafate\" (Berberis heterophylla), and \"neneo\" (Mulinum spinosum). The lake's shores are stony with scanty vegetation in low shrubs.\nThe basin of the lakes Posadas/Pueyrred\u00f3n and Ghio is the lowest glacier depression in the southern Patagonian Andes, raising only 500 ft over the sea level. Lago Posadas, fed by the glacier rushing streams of the Furioso and Tarde rivers, receives with the thawing suspended matter that confers its unmistakable color. Separated from the crystalline and deep blue Lago Pueyrred\u00f3n by the isthmus (La Pen\u00ednsula), now drains into it, and both to the Pacific Ocean. In older times, the waters flowed to the Atlantic. From remote times the basin sheltered both human and animal life, of which give proof important archaeological remains; a guide is recommended.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe town of Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen (Lago Posadas) and the National Route 40 (Argentina) are located in the vicinity of the lake. This guarantees accessibility, lodging infrastructure and services for visitors.\nThe whole region is known as a trout and salmonidae fishing destination, and a place also suitable for trekking, kayaking and rural tourism.\nFrom Lake Posadas it's also possible to travel to Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n del r\u00edo Pinturas, entering the Patagonian steppe. There is a sector called Cueva de las Manos (\"Cave of Hands\"; where many ancient paintings can be found. These painting are 10000 years old.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSistema Nacional de Informaci\u00f3n H\u00eddrica de Argentina (in English)\n\n\n== External links ==\nLago Posadas (in Spanish) Tourism information",

            "content": "The Llanberis Lake Railway (Welsh: Rheilffordd Llyn Padarn) is a 1 ft 11 1\u20442 in (597 mm) narrow gauge heritage railway that runs for 2.5 miles (4 km) along the northern shore of Llyn Padarn in north Wales in the Snowdonia National Park. The starting point is the town of Llanberis at the eastern end of the lake (53.1175\u00b0N 4.1193\u00b0W\ufeff / 53.1175; -4.1193\ufeff (Llanberis station)), with the western terminus at Pen Llyn in the Padarn Country Park (53.1370\u00b0N 4.1495\u00b0W\ufeff / 53.1370; -4.1495\ufeff (Penllyn station)). The return journey takes around 60 minutes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe Llanberis Lake Railway runs along part of the trackbed of the defunct Padarn Railway, a 4 ft (1,219 mm) gauge line which connected the quarry with Y Felinheli (Port Dinorwic) on the Menai Strait. The Padarn Railway closed in October 1961 and was lifted between 16 May 1962 and February 1963. Following the closure of the Padarn Railway, various plans were made to open a 2 ft (610 mm) gauge tourist railway on the trackbed. The first serious attempt was made by G. Ward a local resident, who proposed a railway that would circle Llyn Padarn using the trackbeds of the British Rail Llanberis branch and the Padarn Railway. This plan would have utilized track and locomotives from the Dinorwic slate quarry, but the company did not pursue the proposal.\n\n\n=== Quarry closure and formation of the railway company ===\nIn July 1966, A. Lowry Porter of Southend-on-Sea proposed a shorter railway running from the quarry company's workshops at Gilfach Ddu near Llanberis to Penllyn, along the eastern-most three miles of Padarn Railway trackbed. Negotiations were progressing with the company, when in July 1969 the quarry closed at short notice. The quarry's workshops at Gilfach Ddu were purchased by the Gwynedd County Council with the intention of creating a Country Park.\nThe quarry's land and equipment were put up for auction, and Lowry Porter's fledgling railway company purchased three steam locomotives and one diesel locomotive for use on the planned lake railway. In June 1970 the County Council purchased the trackbed of the Padarn Railway and agreed to allow its use for the lake railway.\nThe Ruston diesel locomotive was quickly put into service laying track. Meanwhile, the first steam locomotive, Dolbadarn, was restored to working order. The new railway was built to 1 ft 11 1\u20442 in (597 mm) narrow gauge instead of the more unusual 1 ft 10 3\u20444 in (578 mm) narrow gauge used in the quarries. This required all the rolling stock to be regauged, including the locomotives. Tracklaying progressed during 1970 using track recovered from several sources, including some originally used on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway.\nNew carriages were built using the chasses of bogie wagons. These initial efforts at creating passenger stock proved unsatisfactory \u2014 they had a tendency to derail due to their very rigid construction. This caused a delay in opening, and a subsequent rapid redesign of the carriages.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nThe railway officially opened on 28 May 1971 but because of the need to redesign the carriage stock, the first public trains did not run until 19 July 1971. By the end of the first season, more than 30,000 passengers had been carried. In the winter of 1971 the railway was extended to its current terminus at Penllyn. For the beginning of the 1972 season, a second steam locomotive Red Damsel was returned to service with a new name: Elidir. The locomotive roster was expanded that year to include Maid Marian (now operating on the Bala Lake Railway) and an 0-4-0 tank locomotive built by Jung in Germany.\n\n\n=== Llanberis extension ===\nIn June 2003 the railway was extended to the town of Llanberis, with a new station close to the start of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. The original terminus at Gilfach Ddu is now a through station serving both the National Slate Museum and the nearby Dolbadarn Castle. On the return journey from Pen Llyn, passengers may alight at Cei Llydan station, where a picnic site is available with views of the Snowdonian mountains above Llanberis Pass.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe railway uses three steam locomotives (\u201cElidir\u201c, \u201cDolbadarn\u201d and \u201cThomas Bach\u201d) all of which ran on the internal 1 ft 10 3\u20444 in (578 mm) gauge lines of the Dinorwic Quarry. There are also several diesel locomotives which are used for works trains and when the steam locomotives are unavailable for passenger trains.\nWhen the Quarry closed down in 1969 the lakeside section of the trackbed was utilised for the current Llanberis Lake Railway, originally running from the National Slate Museum at Gilfach Ddu to Pen Llyn. Gilfach Ddu was the main engineering workshop of the Dinorwic Quarry and provided repair facilities for all of the steam locomotives of the quarry system.\n\n\n== Locomotives ==\n\n\n=== Current locomotives ===\n\n\n=== Also on site ===\n\n\n=== Former locomotives ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nBritish narrow gauge railways\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\"Llanberis Lake Railway under construction 1\". digiDo. \n\"Llanberis Lake Railway under construction 2\". digiDo. \n\"Gilfach Ddu, velocipede and early Llanberis Lake Rly\". digiDo. \n\"Llanberis Lake Railway\". digiDo. \n\n\n== References ==\nThomas, Cliff (2002).

McGlocklin (born June 10, 1943) is an American former professional basketball player born in Franklin, Indiana.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nA sharpshooting 6'5\" guard from Indiana University, McGlockin was selected by the Cincinnati Royals in the third round of the 1965 NBA draft, but he is best known for his 8-season (1968\u20131976) tenure with the Milwaukee Bucks, with whom he won an NBA Championship (as a teammate of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson) in 1971. He scored 9,169 points in his NBA career, and his #14 jersey has been retired by the Bucks franchise. He also appeared in the 1969 NBA All-Star Game\nMcGlocklin was best known for his high-arcing \"rainbow\" jump shot from the wings, in what would now be three-point territory. It was most effective when paired in a two-man play with Jabbar: if the opposing guard fell back to double-team Jabbar, McGlocklin would make them pay from the perimeter; when the guard came out to defend him, he would pass the ball down to Jabbar with only one defender, who under most circumstances was out-matched.\nMcGlocklin was selected as one of the \"Top 50 Basketball Players\" of the 20th Century, in his home state of Indiana, as well as being inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association and the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Announcing ==\nFor the last 25 years, McGlocklin has been a member of the Bucks' television broadcasting team, alongside Jim Paschke. His many years of involvement with the Bucks franchise have caused many fans to call McGlocklin \"Mr. Buck\".\n\n\n== Charity work ==\nOn the night of his retirement in 1976, Jon, along with Eddie Doucette founded the MACC Fund, which has become nationally recognized in its fight against childhood cancer and has raised over $45 million toward childhood cancer research.\n\n\n== NBA career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Regular season ===\n\n\n=== Playoffs ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCareer statistics and player information from Basketball-Reference.com\nProfile at *www.nba.com/bucks\nIndiana Basketball Hall of Fame profile",

Its seat is McMasterville.\nIt surrounds the Richelieu River as the river flows north from Lake Champlain in the United States to the Saint Lawrence River northeast of Montreal at Sorel-Tracy, Quebec. Dramatically different from the mountainous terrain to the south, the river valley is a vast plain that has been developed with extensive farmlands.\nIn the 21st century, the Richelieu River is very popular for both U.S. and Canadian recreational boaters, providing a connection that can bring boaters all the way from the outlet of the Saint Lawrence River to New York Harbor. A number of old fortifications exist dating back to the 17th century; they were built by the French in an effort to try to prevent the Iroquois from using the river as a way to attack the French settlers in the area. Fort Richelieu is at the mouth of the Richelieu River. Fort St. Louis (now Fort Chambly) at Chambly, Fort Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and Fort Saint-Jean at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, are on the way. Fort St. Anne Isle La Motte, Vermont in Lake Champlain is near the river's source. The region is informally known as la Vall\u00e9e-des-Forts.\n\n\n== Subdivisions ==\nThere are 13 subdivisions within the RCM:\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Access Routes ===\nHighways and numbered routes that run through the municipality, including external routes that start or finish at the county border:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of regional county municipalities and equivalent territories in Quebec\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFort Richelieu official site",

            "content": "The Delta M or Thor-Delta M was an American expendable launch system used for thirteen orbital launches between 1968 and 1971. It was a member of the Delta family of rockets.\nThe Delta M had a three-stage configuration. The first stage was the Long Tank Thor, a stretched version of the Thor missile, previously flown on the Delta L. Three Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to the first stage to increase thrust at lift-off. A Delta E was used as the second stage, and the third stage was a Star-37D solid rocket motor. On the final flight, six boosters were flown instead of three, in a configuration known as the Delta M6, or \"Super Six\".\nAll thirteen launches were made from Launch Complex 17A at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The first launch (carrying Intelsat 301) on September 18, 1968 was a complete failure when the first stage began suffering abnormal pitch gyrations starting at T+20 seconds. The booster maintained a stable attitude until around T+100 seconds when it pitched over and began to break up from structural loads. As the Delta was also headed back towards land, Range Safety sent the destruct signal at T+108 seconds. The fifth launch on July 25, 1969 (Intelsat 305) suffered a rupture of either the third stage casing or nozzle and ended up in an unusable orbit. Of the thirteen launches, twelve carried geosynchronous communications satellites. The thirteenth, which was the final flight and the only one in the M6 configuration, placed Explorer 43 into a highly elliptical orbit.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Beaver Creek is a tributary of the Crooked River in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is formed by the confluence of its two forks in southeastern Crook County, a sparsely populated part of Central Oregon. North Fork Beaver Creek flows south and then west around Laughlin Table. South Fork Beaver Creek drains the slopes of Snow Mountain and Funny Butte in southwestern Grant County before joining the North Fork.\nThe Beaver Creek main stem flows west from the forks' confluence to near Birdsong Butte then southwest down Paulina Valley past the unincorporated community of Paulina to join the South Fork Crooked River. From this confluence, the main stem of the Crooked River flows generally west 125 miles (201 km) to meet the Deschutes River, a tributary of the Columbia River.\nNamed tributaries of the creek from source to mouth are Sugar Creek, which enters from the right; Grindstone Creek, left; Wolf and Paulina creeks, right; Alkali Creek, left; Profanity Gulch, right, and Drift Canyon, left. Oregon Route 380 (Paulina Highway) runs along the lower creek from near Paulina to the mouth. The stream flows under the highway twice, first slightly upstream of Paulina and then further downstream near Profanity Gulch.\n\n\n== Camping ==\nSugar Creek Campground is along Sugar Creek, a tributary of Beaver Creek that flows generally west to the main stem from the Ochoco Mountains. Amenities include campsites, picnic tables, toilets, and drinking water. A short paved trail at the campground follows Sugar Creek through a forest of ponderosa pines.\nWolf Creek Campground is along Wolf Creek, another tributary of Beaver Creek that flows west from the same mountainous area as Sugar Creek. Amenities include campsites, picnic tables, toilets. Both campgrounds are managed by the United States Forest Service.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rivers in Oregon\n\n\n== References ==",

At the age of 16, he was appointed to a percussion position in the Denver Symphony Orchestra, joining his father, Walter E. Light, who was the timpanist. He began a 27-year stint as principal timpanist after his father's death in 1952.\nDissatisfied with the instruments available to him post\u2013World War II, he took up drum building in order to recreate the Dresden-style timpani built in Germany before the war. Eventually, other timpanists asked Light to build drums for them. In 1950, he formed the American Drum Manufacturing Company, which still builds custom timpani to this day.\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Biography: Walter Light\". American Drum Manufacturing Co.

She worked most of her career for Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling.\n\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\n\n=== Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling (1989\u20131998) ===\nTrained by Tarzan Goto in the FMW Dojo, Eriko Tsuchiya debuted on the very first Frontier Martial Arts Wrestling show on October 6, 1989, losing a four-way match to Witch Warrior, which also saw Miwa Sato and Kumiko Matsuda debut as well. Tsuchiya spent the first year teaming with Matsuda until March 1990, when Yoshika Maedomari debuted, and she began teaming with Maedomari. In March 1992, she defeated Miwa Sato to win her first championship, the WWA World Women's Championship, which she held for nearly two months, before losing it to Megumi Kudo.\nIn July 1993, she evolved into an evil hardcore wrestler named Shark Tsuchiya. Adopting the hardcore style reminiscent of Mr. Pogo, Tsuchiya quickly became the top female heel of FMW, going through a long-running feud its top female babyface, Megumi Kudo. In November 1995, she regained the WWA World Women's Championship, which is now unified with the Independent World Women's Championship, from Kudo, and held it for a month, before losing both titles to Combat Toyoda. It wouldn't be until March 1997 that she regained the titles from Kudo, only to lose them over a month later to Kudo in her retirement match. Although she would regain the titles in September 1997, defeating Aja Kong in a decision match, FMW abandoned the titles and the Women's division, and Tsuchiya left the company in June 1998.\n\n\n=== Freelancing (1998\u20132010) ===\nAfter leaving FMW in 1998, Tsuchiya began wrestling for various promotions as a freelancer, such as All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling, JDStar, Ladies Legend Pro-Wrestling, Onita Pro Wrestling, Dramatic Dream Team, NEO Ladies, IWA Japan, JWP Joshi Puroresu, Onita FMW, World Entertainment Wrestling, OZ Academy, GAEA Japan, Wrestling Marvelous Future, and Super FMW, until 2010.\n\n\n=== Hiatus and retirement (2010\u20132016) ===\nAfter her last match on record for Super FMW in 2010, Tsuchiya has been very inactive, as she has also been doing work on cosmetics. It was revealed that on November 8, 2016, Tsuchiya will have her official retirement ceremony at FMW's Korakuen Hall show on November 24. It also revealed that in August 2015, Tsuchiya was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and in October 2015, she was forced to have her right leg amputated below the knee due to gangrene (she originally had three toes removed from her right foot before the final amputation), and in May 2016, her right breast was removed due to breast cancer.\n\n\n== In wrestling ==\nFinishing moves\nTsuchi Bomb (Powerbomb)\n\nEntrance themes\n\"Mad Dog\" by FMW Productions\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\nFrontier Martial Arts Wrestling\nWWA World Women's Championship (4 times)\nFMW Independent World Women's Championship (3 times)\n\nTokyo Sports\nJoshi Puroresu Grand Prize (1997)\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "A selenenic acid is an organoselenium compound and an oxoacid with the general formula RSeOH, where R \u2260 H. It is the first member of the family of organoselenium oxoacids, which also include seleninic acids and selenonic acids, which are RSeO2H and RSeO3H, respectively. Selenenic acids derived from selenoenzymes are thought to be responsible for the antioxidant activity of these enzymes.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nIn contrast to selenonic and seleninic acids, selenenic acids are unstable with respect to a self-condensation reaction to form the corresponding selenoseleninates or disproportionation into corresponding seleninic acids and diselenides:\n2 RSeOH \u2192 RSe(O)SeR + H2O\n2 RSeOH \u2192 RSeO2H + 1/2 RSeSeR\nEven the very bulky 2,4,6-tri-tert-butylbenzeneselenenic acid disproportionates readily. A stable selenenic acid was synthesized by burying the SeOH functional group within the cavity of a p-tert-butyl[calix[6]arene macrocycle]. X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed the Se-O bond length to be 1.763 \u00c5. The S-O absorbs in the IR spectrum at 680\u2013700 cm\u22121. In a stable selenenic acid prepared by oxidizing a highly hindered selenol, BmtSeH, the Se-O bond length was found to be 1.808 \u00c5 while the O-Se-C angle was 96.90\u00b0. Oxidation of BmtSeOH gave BmtSeO2H.\nSelenenic acids are believed to be transient intermediates in a number of redox reactions involving organoselenium compounds. One notable example is the syn-elimination of selenoxides. Selenenic acids are also transient intermediates in the reduction of seleninic acids as well as the oxidatlon of diselenides. The reasoning for postulating selenenic acids as reactive intermediates is based in part on analogy with their more extensively studied sulfenic acid analogs.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nSelenenic acids derived from selenocysteine are involved in cell signaling and certain enzymatic processes. The best known selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalyzes the reduction of peroxides by glutathione (GSH). The selenenic acid intermediate (E-SeOH) is formed upon oxidation of the catalytically active selenol (E-SeH) by hydrogen peroxide. This selenenic acid derivative of the peroxidase then reacts with a thiol-containing cofactor (GSH) to generate the key intermediate selenenyl sulfide (E-SeSG). This intermediate is subsequently attacked by a second GSH to regenerate the selenol and the glutathione cofactor is released in its oxidized form, GSSG. The catalytic mechanism of GPx, involves selenol (R-SeH), selenenyl sulfide (R1-SeS-R2), and selenenic acid intermediates.\nRSeH + H2O2 \u2192 RSeOH + H2O\nRSeOH + GSH \u2192 GS-SeR + H2O\nGS-SeR + GSH \u2192 GS-SG + RSeH\nIn the absence of thiols, selenols tend to overoxidize to produce seleninic acids. Many organoselenium compounds (selenenamides, diaryl diselenides) contain \"interesting\" biological activities. Their activity is attributed to their mimicry of glutathione peroxidase activity. They reduce hydroperoxides that otherwise convert to toxic byproducts and/or reactive oxygen species that can cause further damage to the cell.\n\n\n== References ==",

Together with his brothers Paolo, Giovanni and Orazio he headed the De Stefano 'ndrina.\n\n\n== Criminal career ==\n\nCapobastone of the De Stefano 'ndrina, Giorgio De Stefano was among the protagonists of the First 'Ndrangheta war which raged from 1974 to 1976, allied with the Piromalli brothers against the \"old\" 'Ndrangheta of Antonio Macr\u00ec and Domenico Tripodo \u2014 the latter being the former boss of the De Stefano brothers, who under Giorgio managed to break off from his control and become the most important criminal family in Reggio Calabria. During the war he survived an assassination attempt by hitmen loyal to Tripodo, inside the Roof Garden bar in Reggio Calabria, which led to the death of his brother Giovanni. Tripodo would later be killed in prison by men loyal to Raffaele Cutolo, who acted on the behalf of the De Stefano brothers.\nGiorgio De Stefano became victorious in the First 'Ndrangheta war (which caused 233 deaths), and inaugurated, together with other 'ndrine from Reggio Calabria and its province, a new period for the 'Ndrangheta thanks to new lucrative businesses (most notably drug trafficking) and links to the political-institutional world, as well as the formation of the Santa, a secret society within the 'Ndrangheta established in the early 1970s to maximize the power and invisibility of the most important bosses. The Santa allowed the 'Ndrangheta to enter lucrative public contracts.\n\n\n== Downfall ==\nAfter the war Giorgio De Stefano had become extremely powerful (he had links with Cosa Nostra, politics, neo-fascist terrorists and others and was constantly expanding his influence. The other 'ndrine began fearing for their businesses and so decided to kill him. By extorting a bribe of a building contractor already under the protection of the Piromalli's, De Stefano had committed a sgarro (insulting the honour and authority of a crime boss).\nOn 7 November 1977 Giorgio De Stefano was lured to a supposed meeting on Santo Stefano in Aspromonte and there he was killed by a simple soldier, Giuseppe Suraci, who was later killed in revenge and had his head taken literally on a silver plate to Giorgio's brother Paolo De Stefano to appease him. 'Ndrangheta bosses Giuseppe Piromalli and Rocco Musolino were indicted as being responsible for the murder of Giorgio De Stefano, but were later acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nDickie, John (2013).

It includes a major part of the Upper Zambezi basin and the Okavango basin and Delta. The zone includes the Caprivi Strip of Namibia, the southeastern corner of Angola, southwestern Zambia, the northern wildlands of Botswana and western Zimbabwe. The centre of this area is at the confluence of the Chobe River and Zambezi River where the borders of Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe meet. It will incorporate notable sites such as Chobe National Park, Hwange National Park, the Okavango Delta in Botswana and the Victoria Falls.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe initiative was created in cooperation with Peace Parks Foundation and the World Wide Fund for Nature. It developed from the Okavango\u2013Upper Zambezi International Tourism Initiative (OUZIT) and the \u201cFour Corners\u201d Transboundary Natural Resource Management. On 24 July 2003, the Ministers responsible for tourism in Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe met in Katima Mulilo, Namibia and agreed the vision for the KAZA TFCA initiative. In July 2006 SADC's endorsed the KAZA TFCA as a SADC project and on 7 December 2006 the Ministers of Environment and Tourism of the five partner countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding at Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, providing for work towards the establishment of the KAZA TFCA.\nIn November 2014 Zambia and Zimbabwe introduced a common KAZA Visa. Angola, Botswana and Namibia are expected to join the scheme in the future.\n\n\n== Key wildlife ==\nAfrican elephant (population estimated at some 250 000) and cheetah (listed by the IUCN as Vulnerable), and the African wild dog, Wattled Crane and Nile crocodile (all listed by the IUCN as Endangered).\n\n\n== Components ==\nThe national parks and game reserves within the zone are: in Zambia:\nLiuwa Plain National Park\nKafue National Park\nMosi-oa-Tunya National Park\nSioma Ngwezi National Park\nin Namibia:\nMamili National Park\nMudumu National Park\nBwabwata National Park\nin Botswana:\nChobe National Park\nMakgadikgadi National Park\nNxai Pan National Park\nMoremi Game Reserve\nin Zimbabwe:\nHwange National Park\nKazuma Pan National Park\nZambezi National Park\nVictoria Falls National Park\nin Angola:\nLuiana National Park\nLonga-Mavinga National Park\nThere are also various Wildlife Management, Hunting Blocks involved. The Victoria Falls, shared by Zambia and Zimbabwe, is a World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWildlife of Zambia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

Pings are messages sent from blog and publishing tools to a centralized network service (a ping server) providing notification of newly published posts or content. Spings, or ping spam, are pings that are sent from spam blogs, or are sometimes multiple pings in a short interval from a legitimate source, often tens or hundreds per minute, due to misconfigured software, or a wish to make the content coming from the source appear fresh.\nSpings, like spam blogs, are increasingly problematic for the blogging community. Estimates from Weblogs.com and Matt Mullenweg's Ping-o-Matic! service have put the sping rate\u2014the percentage of pings that are sent from spam blogs\u2014well above 50%. A study commissioned by Ebiquity Group and conducted by the University of Maryland in 2006 confirmed that these numbers are around 75%. Since then, growth in sping has slowed such that the portion of pings that are spam has dropped to 53%.\nThe term was popularized by David Sifry from Technorati in his February 2006 State of the Blogosphere report, but was coined initially in September 2005 by a French SEO blogger, S\u00e9bastien Billiard, in an article titled \"Spam 2.0\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpam in blogs\nReferrer spam\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAs Blogs Grow, So Does Spam, Christopher Heun, Internet Week, April 21, 2006",

The three bridges cross the four river channels of the River Ill that flow through Strasbourg's historic Petite France quarter. The Ponts Couverts have been classified as a Monument historique since 1928.\nConstruction of the Ponts Couverts commenced in 1230, and they were opened in 1250. As a defensive mechanism, they were superseded by the Barrage Vauban, just upstream, in 1690, but remained in use as bridges. As built, each of the bridges was covered by a wooden roof that served to protect the defenders who would have been stationed on them in time of war. These roofs were removed in 1784, but name Ponts Couverts (covered bridges) has remained in common use ever since.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPonts Couverts on archi-wiki.org (in French)",

There are three classes of proteins with HEPN domains:\nSingle-domain HEPN proteins found in many bacteria.\nTwo-domain proteins with N-terminal nucleotidyltransferase (NT) and C- terminal HEPN domains. This N-terminal NT domain belongs to a large family of NTs, which includes several classes of enzymes that are responsible for some types of bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides. These enzymes deactivate various antibiotics by transferring a nucleotidyl group to the drug.\nA multidomain sacsin protein in genomes of fish and mammals. The HEPN domain is located at the C terminus of the protein, directly after the DnaJ domain. The crystal structure of the HEPN domain from the TM0613 protein of Thermotoga maritima indicates that it is structurally similar to the C-terminal all-alpha-helical domain of kanamycin nucleotidyltransferases (KNTases). It is composed of five alpha helices, three of which form an up- and-down helical bundle, with a pair of short helices on the side. The distant structural similarity suggests that the HEPN domain might be involved in nucleotide binding.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Pfam and InterPro IPR007842",

Born in Petit-Go\u00e2ve on March 17, 1942, Jean-Ren\u00e9 J\u00e9r\u00f4me moved to Port-Au-Prince where he attended the \"Petit S\u00e9minaire Coll\u00e8ge St-Martial\" and later the \"Coll\u00e8ge Moderne\u201d. His family is a part of the elite of Haitian society, which enabled him to engage in a variety of artistic activities that interested him such as dance, theatre, drawing, voice and painting. He was able to study drawing and painting at the School of Fine Arts.\nIn 1965, he won first prize at the Esso Salon Competition. He later decided to devote himself entirely to painting and opened a studio in Port-Au-Prince in 1968. J\u00e9r\u00f4me is best known for the originality of his paintings, particularly those of nude females. He was awarded an art scholarship by the US government in 1970 and stayed for four months, studying and working with Bernard S\u00e9journe. In 1973 he returned to Haiti and taught at the School of Fine Arts. He founded the School of Beauty with Bernard S\u00e9journe, Jean-Claude Legagneur and Philippe Dodard.\nIn 1985, he founded the \"Ateliers J\u00e9r\u00f4me\" where his own paintings and other artist\u2019s works are exhibited. His artwork has been exhibited in countries such as Canada, Brazil, Senegal, United States, Martinique, Latin America, Dominican Republic, Europe and Haiti. Jean-Ren\u00e9 J\u00e9r\u00f4me died in 1991. Illustrations of his painting can be seen in Selden Rodman\u2019s book \u201cWhere Art is Joy\u201d, Eva Pataki\u2019s book, \u201cHaitian Painting\u201d and Gerald Alexis\u2019 book, \u201cPeintres Ha\u00eftiens\u201d.\n\n\n== References ==\nSchutt-Ain\u00e9, Patricia (1994).

The district boundaries are regulated by the State Electoral Office, according to the requirements of the South Australian Constitution and are subject to mandatory redistributions by the State Electoral Office in order to respond to changing demographics.\n\n\n== Boundary adjustments ==\nElectoral boundaries are adjusted after each election. The primary consideration is to attempt to ensure that the party that obtains 50% or more of the overall vote at a general election is able to form a government. The number of electors in each district must be within 10% of the average at the time of the redistribution order. After these primary considerations, other issues are considered, including economic, social and regional communities of interest. Despite this elaborate and expensive process, the system is not particularly reliable; cases where the party forming government has received less than 50% of the two-party-preferred vote are not un-common, and have occurred in three of the last four elections.\nWhile South Australia's total population is 1.7 million, Adelaide's population is 1.3 million \u2212 uniquely highly centralised, over 75% of the state's population resides in the metropolitan area and has 72% of seats (34 of 47) alongside a lack of comparatively sized rural population centres, therefore the metropolitan area tends to decide election outcomes. At the 2014 election for example, although the statewide two-party vote (2PP) was 47.0% Labor v 53.0% Liberal, the metropolitan area recorded a 2PP of 51.5% Labor v 48.5% Liberal.\n\n\n== List of the current 47 electoral districts ==\n\n\n== Maps ==\n\n\n== Numbers of Electorates and Members ==\nSince 1938, the South Australian House of Assembly has had single-member electoral districts. From 1938 to 1968 there were 39 districts. Since 1970 there have been 47 electoral districts. From 1857 to 1933, the number of districts varied between 12 (1912\u20131915) and 27 (1890\u20131901).

            "content": "Woodbine Savings Bank, also known as the Columbia Hotel, Haight Real Estate and Insurance, and Swain Realty, is located in Woodbine, Iowa, United States. The significance of this building has less to do with banking specifically, and commerce in general. After the building was constructed it housed both the bank and the hotel. The bank occupied the northwest corner of the building and it remained here for forty years. The hotel occupied the southern portion of the building and then it expanded to the east with a new addition not long after its initial construction. A milinary shop occupied its former first-floor location. The building was the largest in town until 1966. The hotel remained for only eight years, and it was one of two hotels in town in those years. Other significant businesses that occupied the building include Boyer Valley Telephone Company, which expanded from one line out of town to multiple lines during its short tenancy here. Other businesses include the town newspaper, the Woodbine Twiner, the Harrison County Rural Electric Cooperative had their first offices here, and Haight Real Estate and Insurance Company, which occupied the bank's former location for another 40 years.\nThe two-story brick structure follows the Romanesque Revival style. It features two uneven bays separated by an entrance to the second floor. The entries on the first-floor are capped with round arches. The second-floor has pilasters, and a corbel table at the parapet. The entrance to the second floor is highlighted by a raised parapet, giving the allusion of a tower. The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The following year it was included as a contributing property in the Woodbine Lincoln Highway and Brick Street Historic District.\n\n\n== References ==",

The first book in his series, Axle Galench and the Gate of No Return, was published in 2004. Rooster released his second book, Axle Galench in Search of Barnsfoggon, in 2005, and has also recorded and performed the music for audio books for each release. Axle Galench and the Spin Lizard Rescue is currently in its final stages of editing and will be published sometime in 2008. Since 2004, Rooster and his wife/business partner Jody Logsdon have sold a combined total of over 13,500 of his books and audio books in his self-publishing endeavors. He has performed for over 2.5 million children since the publication of his first book. He was featured in the Texas Living section of Southern Living Magazine in January 2007. Rooster currently resides in Rockdale, Texas.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDavid Lee Morris was born in Ridgecrest, California, on September 16, 1955, and soon acquired the nickname Rooster. Rooster spent his childhood immersed in the cowboy life. At the age of five, he began riding horses and working cattle with his father on ranches in the tri-state area of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Because he lived in remote places and had few friends his own age, Rooster invented a unique way of entertaining himself. He started mimicking bird calls and coyote howls, then began developing unusual voices. Many years later, the skills he taught himself would result in the recording of an audio book written by John R. Erickson, the author of the Hank the Cowdog books. Moonshiner's Gold contained seventeen people for which Rooster did different voice characterizations.\n\n\n== Musical Background ==\nRooster's musical skills are self-taught as well. He began learning to play the fiddle when he was a teenager. By the time he graduated from high school, he was playing fiddle for the historic Western Cowpunchers Association that was established in the 1880s in Amarillo, Texas. He has since been recorded by the Smithsonian Institution playing old-time fiddle music (album title, Ridin' Old Paint), recorded a CD of his original compositions (Picnic Tree), and taught himself how to play guitar, mandolin, and bass.\n\n\n== Becoming a Writer ==\nIn 1999, Rooster opened for children's author John R. Erickson during a public event in Lubbock, Texas. The response of the audience to Mr. Erickson's reading moved Rooster to become acquainted with the Hank the Cowdog series. He spoke with John, who encouraged him to learn some of the songs and voices so he could do Hank the Cowdog programs in schools. Rooster soon learned the songs and voices from Mr. Erickson's audio books and, in a business agreement with Mr. Erickson, began performing solo Hank the Cowdog shows, ultimately reaching over two million people over the next three years. The enthusiasm of the children to the performances, as well as the positive influence Rooster could see the performances were having on their reading, convinced him to begin writing his own books. His school and community performances now highlight his own Axle Galench books, and include music, storytelling, and writing workshop components.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nAxle Galench and the Gate of No Return (2004)\nAxle Galench in Search of Barnsfoggon (2005)\nAxle Galench and the Spin Lizard Rescue (2012-Not Yet Released)\n\n\n=== Audiobooks ===\nHank the Cowdog audio books 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 by John R.

That same year Col. Millard died. Ester Millard continued to run the school for the next nineteen years, during which time the school had an excellent reputation and a high rate of admission into the military academies. The last graduating class from Millard graduated in 1981.[1].\nThe school was the successor to the earlier Millard's Preparatory School, also founded by Homer Millard, which existed in Washington, D.C. from 1925 to 1948.",

There were initially twelve participants and every time a bell rang they decided which one of them who was next to leave.\nThe show was filmed on the small island Tr\u00e4len in Gothenburg's archipelago. Another season of the show is not planned, instead a housing development is planned for the area. The winner of Tr\u00e4len was Serhan Erdal, who won 500,000 SEK (about USD 70,000).\n\n\n== External links ==\nTr\u00e4len on TV4's Webpage\nTr\u00e4len The Island's webpage",

            "content": "Brookesia ambreensis, also commonly known as the Amber Mountain leaf chameleon, is a species of chameleon endemic to Madagascar. It was initially described in 1995 by Raxworthy and Nussbaum.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nBrookesia ambreensis is endemic to Montagne de Ambre National Park (Amber Mountain National Park) in Madagascar, where it has a type locality of the Antomboka River at an elevation between 1,050 and 1,100 m (3,440 and 3,610 ft) above mean sea level. Currently, specimens of B. ambreensis can be found between 650 and 1,150 m (2,130 and 3,770 ft) above mean sea level over an area of 287 km2 (111 sq mi). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classed this species as Near Threatened, as there is a future possible threat against it. If this threat became active, the species could not become Critically Endangered, but it could be listed as an endangered species because it can only be found in one place with a small area. Logging for charcoal is one of the possible dangers to this species of chameleon, along with the collection of various rosewoods. It can commonly be found in the \"rainy season\", and the population is currently stable. The species is not currently protected by any laws.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nBrookesia ambreensis was initially described by Raxworthy and Nussbaum in 1995. Four years later, Necas later described it under the same name: 276, and in 1999 by Townsend et al. According to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), the taxonomic status of B. ambreensis is valid, as of 2012. The species is part of the Brookesiinae subfamily of chameleons. It is also more commonly known as the Amber Mountain leaf chameleon.\n\n\n== References ==",

The sculpture consists of two parts - the figure of the photographer and a round frame with large ears, in which those who wish to pose for a photograph can put their faces.\nThe sculpture is located on the main street of the city of Perm, Komsomol Prospect, near the \"Ural\" hotel and is located on the \"Perm Green Line\" - a pedestrian route for tourists. The monument was unveiled on April 1, 2006.\n\n\n== Background ==\nA \"Permyak\" is a resident of Perm and \"Permyak salty ears\" is the traditional nickname for the inhabitants of Perm and the surrounding countryside. The region was well known for salt production and according to legend, the nickname was given to workers who used to carry bags of salt on their shoulders and whose ears became saturated with salt, causing them to increase in size and turn red.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2009, according to the magazine \"Russian World\", the monument was judged to be \"the strangest\" in Russia.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is a traditional item of furniture in Iranian culture. A family or other gathering sits on the floor around the korsi during meals and special events, like Nowruz (Persian/Zoroastrian New Year's Eve). A korsi used to be quite popular for entire families to gather together during yearly Yald\u0101 celebrations.\nKorsis are generally heated with electric elements or, traditionally, with a brazier containing hot coals that is placed under the table. The table is covered with a thick cloth overhanging on all sides to keep its occupants warm. The occupants sit on large cushions around the korsi with the cloth over their laps.\nA special woven rug called ru korsi (Persian: \u0631\u0648\u06a9\u0631\u0633\u06cc) is usually placed over any blankets to protect them from food stains.\n\n\n== See also ==\nKotatsu, a similar Japanese item\nFoot stove, a similar Dutch item\n\n\n== References ==\n\nArasteh, Reza & Josephine (1970).

            "content": "The Zaharia family was an Albanian noble family that appears for the first time mentioned in the 14th century. A certain Nicholas Zaharia is first mentioned in 1385 as a Bal\u0161i\u0107 family commander and governor of Budva in 1363. After more than twenty years of fidelity, Nicholas Zaharia revolted in 1386 and became ruler of Budva. However, in 1389 \u0110ura\u0111 II Bal\u0161i\u0107 recaptured the city.\nThe name of Nicholas Zaharia appears in the form of Nikola Sakat in many original Venetian and Ragusan documents (as governor of Budva in 1383, influential person in Zeta in 1386 and lord of Dagnum during a period of cooperation with Bal\u0161i\u0107 family). That is a basis for some conclusions that Nicholas Zaharia and Nikola Sakat are the same person who is related to Koja Zaharia. Komnen Arianiti of Arianiti family had married the daughter of Nicholas Zaharia Sakati, ruler of Budva. They had three sons (Gjergj, Muzaka, and Vladan), and one daughter who married Pal Dukagjini.\nIn 1396, due to a favorable political situation, Koja Zaharija captured the castle of Dagnum and declared himself a vassal of the Ottomans. In his second marriage Balsha III married Bolja, a daughter of Koja Zaharia, in 1412 or at the beginning of 1413. In 1415 their only son and the only male descendant of Bal\u0161a family died. Koja maintained the control of the region and upon his death, they were passed to his only son Lek\u00eb Zaharia.\nAccording to Marin Barleti, in 1445 during the ceremony of the marriage of Skanderbeg sister Mamica Kastrioti, he had a dispute with Lek\u00eb Dukagjini. The reason of this dispute was a woman named Irene Dushmani, the heir of Dushmani family. She seemed to prefer Zaharia, while this was not accepted by Dukagjini. A skirmish happened and Lek\u00eb Dukagjini remained wounded, saved only by the intervention of Vrana Konti. Two years later, in 1447, Lek\u00eb Zaharia was killed in an ambush and Lek\u00eb Dukagjini was accused of this murder.\nOriginal Venetian documents show that this murder happened in 1444. According to Venetian chronicler Stefano Magno it was Nicholas Dukagjin, Zaharia's vassal, who killed Lek\u00eb Zaharia in the battle, not Lek\u00eb as stated by Marin Barleti. Stefano Magno also stated that, before he died, Lek\u00eb Zaharia expressed his wish that his properties should be handed over to Venetian Republic.\nHaving left no heirs, the fortress of Dagnum was claimed from Skanderbeg in the name of League of Lezh\u00eb, whose Lek\u00eb Zaharia was a participant. However, his mother surrendered the castle to the Venice Republic. This events triggered the Albanian Venetian war which lasted two years. In the end the castle of Dagnum remained in Venetian hands toward an annual tribute to Skanderbeg.\nAccording to Eqrem Vlora, some members of the Zaharia family were initially Eastern Orthodox Christians and then converted to Roman Catholicism in 1414.\nBozha Zaharia, an Albanian nobleman who also was member of Zaharia family, died in fire which devastated Venetian Scutari in October 1448.\n\n\n== Family tree ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPjet\u00ebr Zakaria, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sap\u00eb and of Dagnum\nElia Zaharia, wife of Leka, Crown Prince of Albania\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nSpremi\u0107, Mom\u010dilo (2004), \u0106ulibrk, Jovan, ed., Crkvene prilike u Zeti u doba Nikona Jerusalimca (in Serbian), Cetinje, Belgrade: Svetigora, Publikum, pp. 73\u2013108",

They are now collectables.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe bodies and the clothing of Lenci boy and girl dolls are made of pressed woolen felt. The bodies were machine stitched up the back and across the shoulders then hand stitched between the legs. This allowed them to wear low cut tops and clothes that displayed their limbs. The faces were pressed on moulds and features were then hand painted, hair was made from mohair and this was stitched in. Felt pressed dolls were very popular in the nineteenth century and just after the first world war. The eyes face sideways, giving the boys a sullen expression and the girls one of loneliness. These dolls have Lenci stamped into the felt of the foot. They were produced in various sizes, sold with various costumes or uniforms. The two dolls in the Judges' Lodgings museum in Lancaster have the boy in a burgundy cardigan, and the girl in a blue hat and coat.They were purported to have been made in memory and in the image of a dead daughter. (Personal memory of 'sales pitch' by clerk in the Lenci store in France when doll purchased for me in 1930, although have heard it from others.)\n\n\n== History ==\nElena K\u00f6nig was born in Turin in 1885. She moved to Germany, where she acquired the pet name of Lenchen which mutated into Lenci when back in Italy. During the chaos of the Great War where Italy fought against Germany, she experimented with felt, and its many properties. She married Enrico Scavini in 1915, and he included felt doll manufacture in the Lenci business- one that was primarily concerned with ceramics.\nIn 1937, the firm employed 300 workers and the family relinquished control.\nThe factory was bombed during an air-raid in 1944. The company liquidated in 2002.\n\n\n== In literature ==\nPhotographer and author Dare Wright wrote a series of children's books, beginning in 1957 with The Lonely Doll, featuring her childhood Lenci doll, \"Edith\", as the main character.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLenci Collectors' website\nLazenby.

            "content": "Juniper J-Series is a series of enterprise routers designed and manufactured by Juniper Networks. They are modular routers for enterprises running desktops, servers, VoIP, CRM / ERP / SCM applications. The J Series routers are typically deployed at remote offices or branch locations. These Services routers include the J2320 and J2350 for smaller offices, the J4350 for medium-size branches, and the J6350 for large branches or regional offices.\n\n\n== Platform development history ==\nJuniper began working on J-Series in the middle of the telecom downturn (2002), while looking for ways to extend its product portfolio. The main idea behind the new product line was to create the cost-optimized routing system that could utilize increasingly powerful general-purpose CPUs and operate under fully-fledged, multi-threaded OS. This was a major departure from \"traditional\" branch router design, which dictated the use of low-end RISC CPUs working under simplified operating system with marginal multitasking and memory protection capabilities. The first iteration of J-Series design was based on high-end Intel CPUs and featured Intel IXP-based interface cards running over PCI bus. Later models added PCI Express connectivity as well as specialized Cavium security processors. From the software perspective, J-series runs JUNOS with a real-time extensions for the forwarding plane function. This unique architecture allows J-series to avoid the \"resource starvation\" problem commonly seen on legacy software forwarding platforms.\n\n\n== Models and platforms ==\nThe J-series of routers includes the models such as J2320, J2350, J4350 and J6350. The initial models were J2300, J4300 and J6300 routers.\n\n\n=== J2320 ===\nThe J2320 routers are entry level service routers which gives up to 600 Mbit/s throughput performance, has four built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports.It has three PIM slots for additional LAN/WAN connectivity, Avaya VoIP Gateway, and WAN acceleration. They are used for one or two broadband, T1, or E1 interfaces with integrated services.\n\n\n=== J2350 ===\nThe J2350 router which has four built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports, gives up to 700 Mbit/s performance.It gives five PIM slots. They are usually used for multiple broadband, T1, or E1 interfaces with multiple integrated services.\n\n\n=== J4350 ===\nThe J4350 enterprise router gives up to 1 Gbit/s in performance. They are usually used for DS3, E3, and Metro Ethernet interfaces with integrated services. It has six PIM slots. Two of these slots are enhanced-performance slots that provide additional performance to multiple Gigabit Ethernet configurations.\n\n\n=== J6350 ===\nThe J6350 gives up to 2 Gbit/s in performance. It has six PIM slots for additional LAN/WAN connectivity, Avaya VoIP Gateway, and WAN acceleration. These routers have optional redundant power supplies for high system availability.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe J-series routers run on Juniper's network operating system, JUNOS. These routers have 4 on-board GigE ports and expandable WAN and LAN interfaces via pluggable modules. They have a wide range of interfaces supporting Serial, T1/E1, FE, DS3/E3, ISDN, ADSL2/2+, G.SHDSL and Gigabit Ethernet and a wide array of Layer 2 access protocols including Frame Relay, Ethernet and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)/HDLC. Other features includes Network Address Translation (NAT), and J-Flow accounting and advanced services such as IPv6, MPLS, Stateful firewall, Quality of Service, multicast, VPN, security services and IPSec. Juniper partnered with Avaya to deliver packet voice functionality.\nJ-Series routers directly benefit from modular and fault-protected software design of the JUNOS operating system. Unlike traditional enterprise routers, each software module in the JUNOS operating system runs independently and therefore cannot impact other processes. The unique, generalized JUNOS architecture provides complete separation of the routing and packet forwarding engines in platforms with both hardware and software forwarding planes. Even under DDoS attack, J-Series routers retain complete control over system operation, allowing console-connected operator to add new filters and policies in order to mitigate the threat. Parts of J-series technology were later reused in SRX series products.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.juniper.net/us/en/products-services/routing/j-series/",

Adjacent to the church is a cemetery. Christian Heinrich Grosch had been tasked to prepare plans and drawings for the church and it was consecrated on September 15, 1865 by Bishop Jens Lauritz Arup. The surrounding cemetery was also consecrated at the same time.\nIn 1865 the church had two church bells, an organ and a simple wooden cross at the altar.\nIn the 1930s the interior was changed after plans by architect Georg Greve. Today's altarpiece, made of wood is created by Dagfin Werenskiold and is a replica of the altarpiece of his in Hornindal Church. The stained glass windows in the church are created by Bernhard Greve.\nThe former organ was replaced in 1976 by a 15 voices pipe organ from Ott Organ Factory in G\u00f6ttingen.\nS\u00f8rkedalen church is listed by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial parish site (in Norwegian)",

            "content": "Far Cry 4 is an action-adventure first-person shooter video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. It is the successor to the 2012 video game Far Cry 3, and the fourth main installment in the Far Cry series. The game was released on November 18, 2014.\nThe game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional Himalayan country. The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught in a civil war involving Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching storyline. The game also features a map editor, a co-operative multiplayer mode, and an asymmetrical competitive multiplayer mode.\nAnnounced in May 2014, development on Far Cry 4 began immediately after the shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that continues 3's story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.\nFar Cry 4 was met with a mostly positive critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A sequel, Far Cry 5, is set to be released in 2018.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nFar Cry 4 is a first-person action-adventure game. Players assume control of Ajay Ghale, a Kyrati-American who is on a quest to spread his deceased mother's ashes in the fictional country of Kyrat. Throughout the game, players can run, leap, and crouch, and have the ability to use weapons including shotguns, crossbows, sniper rifles, mines, throwing knives, bows, flamethrowers, and rocket launchers. The game allows players to take cover to avoid gunfights and to perform melee takedowns from above or up-close. Unlike previous installments in the series, Far Cry 4 gives players the ability to kick objects and the ability to hide the corpses of enemies.\n\nPlayers can use a variety of methods to approach missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped with a digital camera, which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies, animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players can throw bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player and enemies. Players can also hunt and skin animals.\nThe game features an open world environment that is free for players to explore. It features several environments, including forests, rivers, and mountains. To allow players to travel between places faster, the game features various vehicles, including buggies, trucks, and water vehicles like speedboats. Players can drive and shoot at the same time, and can enable auto-drive, in which the game's artificial intelligence takes over the role of controlling the vehicle and guides players to their objectives. Players can also hijack other vehicles while driving. The Buzzer, an aerial, helicopter-like vehicle, is introduced in the game, allowing players to gain a tactical advantage from the air. Parachutes, wingsuits, and grappling hooks are also featured in the game; these items help players swing across cliffs and quickly navigate the environment. Parts of the game take place in Shangri-La, a mystical dreamland where players battle demons as the Kyrati warrior Kalinag. While in Shangri-La, players are accompanied by an injured tiger which serves as their companion. Players can issue commands to the tiger, which assists them in battle.\nThe game world is divided into two halves: North and South Kyrat. Players start in South Kyrat and are free to explore it almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat over the course of the story. The map is progressively opened by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and allowing the Golden Path to expand. These towers help players reveal new areas and mark new locations of interest on the map. The world is scattered with outposts controlled by Pagan Min, which can be infiltrated by players. Four larger outposts, or fortresses, can also be found, and feature stronger defenses and more difficult combinations of enemies. If players successfully liberate these outposts, they will serve as fast-travel points, allowing quick navigation through the game's world. Additional missions and quests also become available. There are many side-missions that can be completed, including hostage rescues, bomb disposal quests, and hunting missions. The collected animals' parts can then be used for crafting new pouches and belts.\nLike its predecessors, the game features some role-playing elements. Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points can then be spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing so will give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up from members of the Golden Path. Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and prayer wheels. There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.\n\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nFar Cry 4 features a co-operative multiplayer mode known as \"Guns for Hire\", which supports up to two players. The mode is separated from the game's campaign, and players are free to explore the game's world, defeat enemies, and infiltrate outposts with their companion. In addition to the co-operative mode, players can gain access to several competitive multiplayer modes which have an asymmetrical structure. Players play as either a Rakshasa or a Golden Path member. The Rakshasa are equipped with bows and arrows, and have the ability to teleport and to summon wildlife to assist them, while Golden Path members are equipped with guns and explosives, and have access to armored vehicles. Known as \"Battles of Kyrat\", players fight against each other in three modes, called Outpost, Propaganda, and Demon Mask. Far Cry 4 also contains a Map Editor that allows users to create and share custom content. Similar to that of Far Cry 3, players can create their maps by customizing landscapes, and by placing buildings, trees, wildlife, and vehicles. However, the Map Editor did not support competitive multiplayer levels at launch. Multiplayer support was added to the game on February 3, 2015.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Premise ===\nThe story was inspired by the ten-year-long Maoist insurgency in Nepal. The game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American who returns to his native country of Kyrat (a fictional Himalayan country derived from Kirati, a collection of Himalayan people originating from Tibet) to spread his deceased mother's ashes. Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds the country in a state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.\n\n\n=== Plot ===\nAfter the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale (James A. Woods) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min (Troy Baker), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal (Naveen Andrews), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.\n\nIn the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul \"De Pleur\" Harmon (Travis Willingham), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar (Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau (Gwendoline Yeo), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.\nHowever the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita (Janina Gavankar), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.\nAs the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.\nAjay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.\n\n\n==== Endings ====\nAjay encounters Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at the start of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Ajay's father sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together, Lakshmana, which would make her Ajay's half-sister. Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale, killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands.\nAjay can choose to shoot down Pagan's helicopter as it flies away, killing Pagan in the process. In that case, Pagan's body can be found in Kyrat next to the downed helicopter. Upon looting Pagan's corpse, Ajay finds a golden pen with an inscription \"For you my love, Ishwari\", and which he can sell for 300,000 rupees.\nIn the aftermath of Pagan's death or departure, the Golden Path seizes control of Kyrat. The final ending depends on which leader Ajay ultimately sided with:\nIf Amita was placed in charge, Kyrat becomes an authoritarian drug state. Ajay finds Amita in Tirtha, forcing villagers into work in factories and drug fields and conscripting children into the group as soldiers to bolster their ranks against the remnants of the Royal Army. He learns that she has had her sister Bhadra taken away, \"never to come again\", subtly implying she has been killed.\nIf Sabal was placed in charge, Kyrat becomes a religious fundamentalist theocracy. Ajay finds Sabal at the Temple of Jalendu, brutally executing all of Amita's supporters, having conducted a ceremony anointing Bhadra as Tarun Matara, a religious symbol for the country to rally around.\nAjay then has one final choice; to either kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.\nAn Easter egg ending can be found at the beginning of the game. To trigger it, Ajay must simply wait at the dinner table during Darpan's torture; Pagan returns shortly and thanks Ajay for being a \"gentleman\", and leads him to Lakshmana's shrine, telling Ajay of his family history before he plants his mother's ashes at the shrine. After Ajay exits the shrine, Pagan then asks Ajay to join him to \"finally shoot some goddamn guns\".\n\n\n=== Escape from Durgesh Prison ===\nEscape from Durgesh Prison is an additional chapter of the story available as downloadable content. It expands upon Ajay's escape from the Durgesh prison and return to the Golden Path, and on Yuma's planned insurrection against Pagan Min.\nFollowing Ajay's escape, he is left stranded in the snow at high altitude where he is rescued by Pagan Min. After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as he is unable to return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called \"The Relic\". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.\n\n\n=== Valley of the Yetis ===\nValley of the Yetis is a downloadable additional chapter of content which takes place directly after Escape from Durgesh Prison.\nIn his way to the Lost Valley to learn more about the expedition Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a cult worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into \"Awakened\", or yetis, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe game's development was led by Ubisoft Montreal, which took over the development of the Far Cry franchise after the release of Far Cry: Instincts in 2005. Additional development was handled by four other in-house Ubisoft studios, Ubisoft Toronto, Red Storm Entertainment, Ubisoft Shanghai, and Ubisoft Kiev. The Montreal studio worked on the game's campaign, the Toronto studio worked on the Shangri-La segments of the campaign, Red Storm handled the development of the competitive multiplayer, the Shanghai studio worked on the hunting missions, and the Kiev studio developed the game's PC version. Development of the game began in late 2012, after the shipment of Assassin's Creed III. The game's creative director is Alex Hutchinson, who had previously worked on Maxis's Spore as well as Assassin's Creed III.\nWhen brainstorming ideas for the new Far Cry game, the development team originally planned on developing a direct sequel to Far Cry 3. The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would extend upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as Far Cry 3's secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not what they wanted to achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a \u201cwe want it all\u201d approach, in which they hoped to experiment with all kinds of ideas. Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's verticality. The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with \"exotic mountainsides\" and \"unique culture\". This led to the concept of a mountainous setting and the introduction of elephants in the game. The developers aimed for players to consider Far Cry 4 a standalone experience, and therefore they avoided bringing back any characters from Far Cry 3 except for Hurk. The decision to bring Hurk back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.\nSome of the gameplay elements were directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, and the freedom for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 an evolution for the series. As a result, the size of the game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players spent a lot of time interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.\nThe game's setting, Kyrat, is a fictional country in the Himalayas region. When building Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size is similar to that of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.\nOne of the game's most critically acclaimed characters is Pagan Min, the game's major antagonist. The team hoped that players would be \"shocked, amazed and intrigued\" by him in every encounter. Min has a complex relationship with the playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him. The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a \"punk-rock mentality\", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from Brothers, and Ichi, a character from Ichi the Killer. Min is designed to be sadistic yet confident, and the team hired Troy Baker to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min. According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone. The interviewer was very pleased with Baker's performance and decided to sign him for the job. As for Ghale, he was designed to be \"thin\", and his backstory was designed to be revealed as players progressed through the game's story. According to the game's narrative director, Mark Thompson, Ghale learns the history and culture of Kyrat along with players. The developers also hoped that Ghale could be an accessible character for players.\n\nIn hindsight, the team considered the story of Far Cry 3 \"great\", even though they thought that it was separated from the game's world. In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players to make choices that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending. The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign. Thompson added that they twisted the story of Far Cry 3 for Far Cry 4, and made outsiders the villains instead of the heroes. The team considered it a \"risk\", but they wanted to try something different.\n\nFor the Shangri-La mission, the team wanted to have a structure similar to 3's mushroom missions; a game within a game. The Shangri-La missions are not related to Kyrat, but play an important role in the game's narrative. When creating these segments, the team put a lot of emphasis on the use of colors. They hoped that the artistic vision for Far Cry 4 would not feature any resemblance to other typical shooter games. It was originally designed to be a small open world, but was later converted into a linear experience due to time constraints and huge creative differences between developers. The team later decided to simplify it, and re-imagined it into an \"ancient, natural world\". It is made up of five different colors. The main color of Shangri-La is gold; the developers thought that using gold as the foundation added \"warmth\" to the dreamland. Meanwhile, red was used heavily to add a sense of strangeness, as well as for establishing a tie to the game's narrative and story. Orange was used as a color of interaction, while white was used to add purity to the world. Blue is the last of Shangri-La's main colors, and represents dangers and honor.\nUbisoft promised that Far Cry 4 would have much more of a multiplayer element than Far Cry 3. Some elements that were scrapped for Far Cry 3 due to time constraints were featured in Far Cry 4, such as the \"Guns for Hire\" co-operative multiplayer mode. Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting from the beginning of the game's development. Originally intended to be a separate mode, it was later made to be seamlessly integrated into the main campaign. The game's competitive multiplayer was designed to give players freedom, allowing players to progress and defeat enemies through a variety of different ways. Red Storm Entertainment also considered players' feedback from the multiplayer aspect of Far Cry 3, and decided to include vehicles to the game. The company chose an asymmetrical structure for the match, so that players could have different experiences in different matches, as well as to make matches feel more chaotic. The developers originally planned to feature female playable characters, but the plan was scrapped due to animation problems. Ubisoft announced a 'Keys to Kyrat' offer for players that owned a copy of the game for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4. It allows those owners to send out game keys to up to ten other people who do not own a copy of the game. Players who are offered a key can join the person that sent them the key and play the co-operative mode for two hours.\nCliff Martinez was hired to work on the game's soundtrack. A two disc edition was released that contained 30 tracks heard in the game, and a deluxe edition was released that contained 15 extra tracks. The album was released just before the release of the game, and received positive reviews. Particular praise was directed towards the usage of traditional Nepalese instruments which, combined with electronic samples, suggested high octane action and mystical wondering.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nWith Far Cry 3 being a commercial success, Ubisoft considered the Far Cry series one of their most important brands, and they hinted that a sequel was in development in June 2013. On October 3, 2013, Martinez mentioned that he was working on the soundtrack for the game. In March 2014 the game's setting and features were leaked. The game was officially announced on May 15, 2014, and the first gameplay footage was revealed during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014. The game's cover art, which shows the light-skinned Pagan Min resting his hand on a dark-skinned person, caused controversy and accusation of racism. Hutchinson later responded and clarified by saying that Pagan Min is not a white person, and that the other person depicted is not the game's protagonist. Hutchinson added that the reaction of the community regarding the cover art was \"uncomfortable\".\nIn addition to the standard version, a Limited Edition of the game could be purchased. This edition features additional in-game missions and an Impaler Harpoon Gun. The Limited Edition was a free upgrade for players who pre-ordered the game. A Kyrat Edition was also announced and it contains a collector's box, a poster, a journal, a map of Kyrat, a figurine of Pagan Min, and the missions from the Limited Edition. Players can also purchase a season pass for the game, which grants them access to additional content, including a new competitive multiplayer mode, a mission called \"the Syringe\", the missions from the Limited Edition, and the two other pieces of downloadable content.\nA Complete Edition of the game was released in 2015, containing all purchasable DLC, including the newly released Valley of the Yetis DLC and all other DLC exclusive to specific editions. It is only available for the PC and PS4 in Europe and Asia.\nFar Cry 4 was released worldwide on November 18, 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. The PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC versions feature higher visual fidelity, such as having a higher texture resolution and more animal fur. The game was supported by downloadable content upon launch. The first DLC, Escape From Durgesh Prison, featuring a new mission set during the main campaign, was released on January 13, 2015. It can be played solo or with another player. The Overrun DLC, which added new maps, a new vehicle, and a new mode to the game's competitive multiplayer, was released on February 10, 2015 for the consoles, and February 12, 2015 for PC. The Hurk Deluxe Pack was released on January 28, 2015 and added several story missions and weapons. The last downloadable content, Valley of the Yetis, features a new region and new story missions which can be played solo or co-cooperatively with another player. Valley of the Yetis was released on March 10, 2015 in North America and March 11, 2015 in Europe.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nFar Cry 4 received a positive reception upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 85.92% based on 12 reviews and 82/100 based on 14 reviews, respectively. The PlayStation 4 version received 83.76% based on 57 reviews on GameRankings and 85/100 based on 83 reviews on Metacritic, and the Microsoft Windows version received 81.00% based on 9 reviews and 80/100 based on 17 reviews, respectively.\nThe game's story received mixed responses. Chris Carter from Destructoid praised the personality of Ajay Ghale, which is \"less in-your-face\" than that of Far Cry 3's protagonist Jason Brody. He also praised the villain, Pagan Min, who he considered took the spotlight every time he appeared in the game. Josh Harmon from Electronic Gaming Monthly thought that the characters in this game had more depth, and that the choices made by players throughout the game were meaningful. Aoife Wilson from Eurogamer thought that the game's characters were memorable, but was disappointed by the story. Nick Tan, from Game Revolution, also praised Min's personality, but he complained that the character appeared too seldom in the game. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, writing for GamesRadar, thought that the story grew tiresome as players progressed, even though some of its characters were interesting. He further criticized the game's writing, which he thought was lackluster. Mike Splechta from GameZone praised the game's voice acting and applauded its storyline, calling it satisfying.\nThe game's setting received positive responses. Carter thought that the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, as well as the game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon thought that the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable. Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of Far Cry 3. Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.\nThe game's design also received acclaim. Carter from Destructoid thought that the fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense of accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthly's Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.\nThe game's multiplayer mode received mixed response. Carter compared the competitive multiplayer to that of Tomb Raider, and called it \"skippable\". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game would still be a strong title without these multiplayer elements. Bertz from Game Informer also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers. Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget. In contrast, GameZone's Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was \"a surprise\" for him. Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.\nHarmon thought that Far Cry 4 was an improvement over Far Cry 3, but he thought that the game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.\n\n\n=== Sales ===\nUbisoft expected the game to sell at least six million copies in its first year of release. Far Cry 4 became the fastest-selling game and the most successful launch in the series in the first week of release. Far Cry 4 was the second best selling game in the United Kingdom for all-formats during the week of its release, only behind Grand Theft Auto V. It was also the sixth best selling game in the US according to The NPD Group. As of December 31, 2014, the game has shipped seven million copies.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe game received the Best Shooter Award from IGN. The game was nominated for Best Artistic Achievement, Best Game Design, Best Music, Best Performer (Troy Baker), and Best Story at the 11th British Academy Games Awards. At the DICE Awards, it was nominated for Game of the Year, Action Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design, Outstanding Technical Achievement and Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, and won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition. At the BAFTA Game Awards, Far Cry 4 received five nominations including best game design and best story eventually winning for best music. The game won Game of the Year and Art Direction, Contemporary (Jean-Alexis Doyon) in 2014 by National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) and received six nominations: Use of Sound, Franchise (Yassine Abouelfalah), Sound Editing in a Game Cinema (Ding Jun Mei), Graphics, Technical (Danny Deslongchamps), Game, Franchise Action (Cedric Decelle), Game Design, Franchise (Gauthier Malou) and Direction in a Game Cinema (S\u00e9bastien Bergeron).\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It was won by Wales, whose run of form during the 1930s was their last sustained period of international success in the team's history. In taking the title they beat both favourites England and the poor Scots, holding Ireland to a score draw. England came second with commanding victories over Scotland and Ireland but suffering defeat to the Welsh on home turf in Newcastle. Ireland also managed victory over the Scots but were well beaten by England and could only draw with Wales to take third place.\n\n\n== Table ==\nThe points system worked as follows:\n2 points for a win\n1 point for a draw\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBritish Home Championship 1919-20 to 1938-1939 - dates, results, tables and top scorers at RSSSF\nGuy Oliver (1992).

            "content": "The Western Suburbs Red Devils (Wests Illawarra, Wests Wollongong, Wests Red Devils or simply Wests Devils) are an Australian rugby league football team based in Figtree. The club is a member of the Country Rugby League and compete in the Illawarra Rugby League premiership. The club play out of Figtree Oval, Figtree. Wests wear red and blue jerseys and have won 14 premierships. Wests Illawarra Leagues club is a thriving club in Unanderra.\nThe West Devils U18's coal league side in 2017 is captained by Vegim Ajdari followed by Jye Phillips as CO captain\n\n\n== History ==\nWests formed in 1949 with the amalgamation of clubs in the district (primarily Unanderra and Mount Keira). The Leagues Club was established in Unanderra and opened in 1956. The Red Devils won the premiership the following year with a 22-6 win over Wollongong. They repeated this effort in 1959 when they defeated Northern Suburbs 12-6 in the Grand Final.\n\n\n=== Four Consecutive Premierships ===\nWith Don Parish at the helm as captain-coach, Wests took back-to-back titles in 1969-70. Warren Ryan continued this trend the following two seasons when he took over, defeating Thirroul (18-11 in 1971, and 23-9 in 1972). Cronulla Sharks legend, Tommy Bishop also guided the team to a premiership in 1978. \n\n\n=== 1980's ===\nWests were again premiers two years later, winning in 1980 and 1981. The following year the Illawarra Steelers were accepted into the NSWRL premiership, thus all the sides in the league became feeder clubs to this side. Being premiers, a large portion of the Red Devils were contracted to the Steelers. This made life difficult in the 1982 premiership for the Red Devils, but within three years they won another premiership. They followed this up with another in 1989 and 1991.\n\n\n=== Flood follows drought ===\nThe Red Devils went through a dry spell from here, not winning the premiership for 18 years. They came close during Brendon Reeves' reign in 2005. They did eventually break the drought in 2009 when they defeated reigning premiers, Thirroul, 14-4 under coach Paul McGregor in his first season. They went back-to-back with a 24-0 win in 2010, again over the Butchers. In 2011, Wests made it a treble of grand final wins with a 34-24 victory over Helensburgh. The Red Devils were unable to match the team of the 60-70s that won four consecutive premierships when they lost 20-16 to finals rivals Thirroul in the 2012 grand final.\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Notable former players ===\nBeau Ryan\nJackson Hastings (2014- Sydney Roosters)\nPlayers in bold represent current NRL players.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Team ===\nIllawarra Rugby League First Grade Premierships: 15\n\n1957, 1959, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1978, 1980, 1981, 1984, 1989, 1991, 2009, 2010, 2011\n\nIllawarra Rugby League Reserve Grade Premierships: 8\n\n1985,1964, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011\n\nIllawarra Rugby League Under-18's Premierships: 4\n\n1992, 2003, 2005, 2011\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWestern Suburbs Official Site\nWests Red Devils Homepage (Sportingpulse)\nCountry Rugby League Homepage\nIllawarra Rugby League Homepage",

This album is the last album of the band, and was released in the label ECM New Series, in October 2014.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nOn this album, the Hilliard Ensemble sings a collection of polyphony from the 15th century, most of them are from anonymous authors, but some of them was written by John Plummer, Walter Lambe, William Cornysh and Sheryngham. Transeamus also includes several ancient carols on a Christmas theme. About the album, David James tells that \"This is music that we were born and bred to sing. We started singing many of these pieces as boys in choirs, so singing this music is for us like going home.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nJames Manheim in his review for All Music says that \"Even though the music is all but unknown, the group has performed these pieces as a live program with powerful effect in the past.\" and \"This is a fine closing chapter to a remarkable career.\"\nIn The Guardian, Nicholas Kenyon gave this album four stars and says that \"They [the Hilliard Ensemble] have admirably decided to quit while they\u2019re ahead, and take their leave with this subtle, underplayed collection of carols and motets from the English repertory\" and he add that \"We will miss the Hilliards' unique explorations.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nECM New Series \u2013 ECM 2408 NS.\nAll lyrics written by anonymous authors, except are indicated.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nHilliard Ensemble\nDavid James \u2013 countertenor\nRogers Covey-Crump \u2013 tenor\nSteven Harrold \u2013 tenor\nGordon Jones \u2013 baritone\n\n\n== References ==",

The highway runs east\u2013west from Eden to U.S. Route 29 (US 29) in Pelham.\n\n\n== Route description ==\nNC 700 is a rural two-lane highway, starting in Eden, where it starts along a concurrency with US 311 and NC 770. The western terminus is at an interchange where in addition to US 311 and NC 770 passing through, NC 14 and NC 87 pass north and south. The three roads run together for over one mile (1.6 km) before NC 700 heads south along Fieldcrest Street. It goes southeast out of the Eden city limits then northeast through a mix of forest and farmland. It ends at an interchange with US 29 (future Interstate 785) just outside of the community of Pelham. The Piedmont Triad Visitor Center is located on NC 700 just west of the interchange.\n\n\n== History ==\nEstablished in 1934 as a new primary routing from northwest of Eden to Pelham. In 1957, NC 700 was truncated to the new freeway alignment of US 29. In 2000, NC 700 was truncated at NC 14/NC 87/NC 770 when all state highways was removed from central Eden.\n\n\n== Junction list ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to North Carolina Highway 700 at Wikimedia Commons\nNCRoads.com: N.C. 700",

It is on land once occupied by Arundel House and its gardens.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nArundel street runs from Strand in the north to Temple Place in the south. Before the construction of the Victoria Embankment (1865-70) it ran as far as the north side of the River Thames. It is joined on its eastern side by Water Street and the modern Maltravers Street, which runs to Milford Lane in the east but was destroyed by the construction of 190 Strand. Howard Street once joined Arundel on the west but no longer exists.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe street is on land once occupied by Arundel House and its gardens, the property of the Howard family, Dukes of Norfolk. Arundel Street and its neighbouring streets, Howard, Norfolk, and Surrey, were all built after Arundel House was demolished by the earl of Arundel in 1678.\nIt is mentioned nostalgically in John Gay's Trivia (1716) as follows:\n\nThe Whittington Club, formed 1847, stood on the east side at the north end on the corner with Water Street. It was designed to offer the advantages of an expensive west end club at lower cost to the middle classes and also offered educational classes.\nThe Arundel Hotel stood at the south end of the street on the western side at the end of the nineteenth century and start of the twentieth. It billed itself as \"the largest private hotel in London\", providing rooms to professional men, officers, and Americans and their families, \"for whom is especially provided a free \"water cooler\". It was rebuilt in the late nineteenth century and the bay front that faced Victoria Embankment was replaced with a gothic design. The hotel existed until at least the mid-twentieth century.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nA large mixed-use development is underway on the eastern side of the street known as 190 Strand, as a result of which Maltravers Street will cease to exist.\nAt the south end on the corner with Temple Place is the modern Arundel House, home of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The building is not on the site of the former Arundel House which was further north.\nThe western side of the street is taken up with office buildings and 190 Strand.\n\n\n== Former inhabitants ==\nFormer inhabitants of Arundel Street include:\nJohn Anstis, Garter King at Arms.\nEustace Budgell, writer for The Spectator and MP.\nGeorge Darley\nSimon Harcourt, Queen Anne's Lord Chancellor.\nCoventry Patmore, poet and author of The Angel in the House.\nJohn Howard Payne, composer of the song \"Home! Sweet Home!\"\nJohn Playford, publisher of The English Dancing Master (1651).\nMrs Porter, tragic actress.\nThomas Rymer, antiquarian, died at his home in the street in 1713 and was buried at nearby St Clement Danes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Arundel Hotel at Wikimedia Commons\n Media related to Arundel Street at Wikimedia Commons",

It is named after the nearby Drassanes Reials de Barcelona, the old shipyards that are now the home of the Museu Mar\u00edtim de Barcelona. It is the closest station to the Port of Barcelona and one of the network's closest stations to the sea, and is served by TMB-operated Barcelona Metro line L3.\nThe station was opened on 14 December 1968 as a prolongation on the line from Liceu once Fernando metro station was closed. Originally known as Atarazanas, it changed its name to Drassanes in 1982. Due to its proximity to the sea and low level, the station has suffered from flooding in the past. It was completely rebuilt in 2007 to make it more accessible by modernizing the platforms and installing elevators.\nBecause of its proximity to sea level, the station is located close to the surface and has only a single level, containing two tracks served by two 90 metres (300 ft) long side platforms. The platforms are linked by a passage under the tracks, but each has its own separate access to the street. The Zona Universit\u00e0ria bound platform has access to Drassanes Avenue and Portal de la Santa Madrona, while the Trinitat Nova bound platform has access to the central promenade of La Rambla\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Drassanes station at Wikimedia Commons\nTransports Metropolitans de Barcelona\nInformation about the station\n\nInformation and photos about the station at Trenscat.com\nHistory and antique photos about the station",

Both weapons were designed by Hungarian engineer P\u00e1l Kir\u00e1ly, who came to the Dominican Republic as an expatriate in 1948. The gun's name is a reference to the San Crist\u00f3bal Province, which is the birthplace of the late Dominican dictator, Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo. The Dominican Republic's military was the main user of this weapon although it was also exported to Cuba prior to the Cuban Revolution.\nThe Crist\u00f3bal had a wooden stock, 30-round bottom-mounted box magazine, and tubular receiver with a fixed cocking handle on the right-hand side. It used lever-delayed blowback for its operation. The original version was produced in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum. The most typical version of the Crist\u00f3bal was made in .30 Carbine.\nOver 200,000 Crist\u00f3bals were made by the Armeria San Crist\u00f3bal from 1950 to 1966. After Trujillo\u2019s assassination on May 31, 1961, the Dominican government decided not to maintain a local military industry and production was slowly wound down. By 1990, the Crist\u00f3bal was no longer a standard Dominican firearm, but continues to be used for basic training in the Dominican Republic's military schools.\nThis carbine was used by Che Guevara during the Cuban Revolution.\n\n\n== Users ==\n Cuba\n Dominican Republic\n\n\n== References ==\n\nRifles and Pistols, Jeremy Flack, Sunburst Books 1995\n\n\n== External links ==\nSan Crist\u00f3bal carbine at Manowar's Hungarian Weapons\nSan Crist\u00f3bal carbine\nImage of a Crist\u00f3bal Carbine field stripped\nright side of receiver\ndetail view of triggers\ndetail view of safety switch\ntop detail view of receiver\nfull view right side\nangled view right side",

            "content": "Gary Wang or Wang Wei (Chinese: \u738b\u5fae; pinyin: W\u00e1ng W\u0113i; born May 8, 1973) is a Chinese entrepreneur. He is the founder of the Chinese video sharing company Tudou.com and served as its CEO until August 2012. He is currently the founder of Light Chaser Animation Studios, an animation studio based in Beijing. Wang is also a novelist, screenwriter, and playwright. He holds a Computer Science degree from the Johns Hopkins University, and an MBA from INSEAD. He received his bachelor's degree in international business from the College of Staten Island, CUNY, in 1995.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early Professional Career ===\nWang's first full-time job out of college was as a salesman of apparel snap fasteners, although he \"wore an ill-fitting $90 suit and didn't know how to pronounce Christian Dior.\" He later moved on to a position at Hughes Electronics, where he worked from 1997 to 2001 through roles in engineering and last held the role of business development manager. After obtaining his MBA at INSEAD in 2002, Wang served as the corporate development director of Bertelsmann Group, an international media company, and also served as the managing director of Bertelsmann Online China, a company operating the e-commerce businesses of Bertelsmann Group in China, from 2003 to 2005.\n\n\n=== Tudou ===\nWang founded Tudou in January 2005 (a few months before YouTube), citing the tightly regulated nature of television content in China and his hope to \"bridge the huge gap between those people who have creative ideas and talent, but cannot get their work to the audience\" as his primary reasons.\nWang formally launched Tudou online on April 15, 2005, and the website soon took off. Tudou started as a website hosting user-generated content (UGC), but soon expanded to include UGC, premium licensed content and content developed in-house, commonly described as a combination of the YouTube, Hulu, and HBO business models. The number of monthly unique visitors to Tudou increased from approximately 50 million in December 2007 to approximately 182 million in December 2010, and to approximately 200 million in May 2011. The number of registered users increased from approximately 35.6 million in December 31, 2008 to approximately 78.2 million as of December 31, 2010 and further to approximately 90.1 million as of June 30, 2011.\nWang took Tudou public on NASDAQ in August 2011. On March 12, 2012, Tudou and competitor Youku.com announced a merger to form Youku Tudou Inc., with Tudou valued at US$1.2 billion. Since the merger was formally completed in August 2012, Wang has retired from the new company's daily operations.\n\n\n=== Light Chaser Animation Studios ===\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal on March 12, 2013, Wang announced his new project, Light Chaser Animation Studios, to produce animated feature films targeting the rapidly growing Chinese movie market, which grew by 30% in 2012 and is widely expected to overtake the U.S. market in size by 2020. He cited the lack of quality domestically produced animation content, a rapidly growing domestic market, and improving environment for movie distribution, promotion and copyrights in China as the main reasons behind his decision.\nLight Chaser Animation Studios is based in Beijing, China.\n\n\n== Creative career ==\nWang is also a novelist and playwright for stage and ballet. At 24, Wang wrote the novel Waiting for Summer, loosely based on his early experiences studying and living in the United States. Wang published the novel in 2006, first serially in the acclaimed Chinese literary magazine Harvest, and then as an independent work a year later. In 2011, Wang wrote The Residential Compound, a stage play about urban development and relocation in Beijing. In the same year, Wang wrote the libretto for the San Francisco Ballet's critically acclaimed RAkU, a story about a \"triangle of obsession\" taking place in the Tokugawa Era.\nWang is the screenwriter and director of Light Chaser Animation's first movie, Little Door Gods.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Sewell Barn Theatre is located in the grounds of Sewell Park Academy (formerly the Blyth school, later the Blyth-Jex school and Sewell Park College) on Constitution Hill in Norwich, England. It is home to a popular amateur theatre company, with close historical links to the author Anna Sewell who wrote Black Beauty.\n\n\n== The auditorium ==\nThe auditorium features raked seating on three sides of an open acting space. This unusual staging helps to draw the audience deeply into the performance. Ground level spaces can be provided for audience members with limited mobility.\nThe auditorium also provides an unusual and convenient space for presentations, meetings and other private hire uses.\n\n\n== History ==\nOriginally the barn belonged to Clare House which was owned by Philip Sewell, a local benefactor, from 1864 to 1906.\nAnna Sewell, author of the children\u2019s story \"Black Beauty\", was Philip\u2019s sister and lived in the White House, Spixworth Road, Spixworth. Philip owned a mare called Black Bess which used to draw his carriage along Spixworth Road and it might be supposed that Bess was the original inspiration for Black Beauty, and the barn a prototype for Black Beauty\u2019s stable. The book was published by Jarrolds in 1877.\nPhilip Sewell died in 1906 and left his house and estate to the City of Norwich. Clare House became an open air school for city children suffering from respiratory complaints and the barn became their washroom, restroom and handicraft centre.\nSince then the old hay barn has seen many uses. During the First World War it was used as a theatre when Catton residents put on a concert for troops billeted in the area. It was used for storage and also as a bicycle shed for girls of the Blyth School (which was constructed in 1929 in the grounds of Clare House). Clare House was demolished in 1970 and out of the rubble rose the foundations of part of the new Blyth Jex school. The barn later housed the very first school minibus.\nDuring a visit to the school in 1974 it was suggested by Norfolk County Councillors that the barn might make an admirable small theatre. At the time the barn was a dirty, leaky building stacked with broken school furniture and other accumulated rubbish. It took several years for this building, with the help of Valerie Glauert - head of Blyth Jex School - to be turned into a fully functioning small theatre.\n\n\n== The Sewell Barn Theatre Company ==\nIn 1980, the Sewell Barn Theatre Company was formed. Their first public production The Norfolk Furies was written and directed by Henry Burke (the first Artistic Director), and staged at the barn.\nThe company stages a number of productions every year, ranging from Shakespeare to Alan Ayckbourn. In February 2008 the company presented its 200th production The Winter's Tale.\n\n\n== Today ==\nMembership of the Sewell Barn company is open to everyone, and workshops are open to non-members. The foyer was renovated in 2012.\nAs of 2016, the Artistic Directors are Cassie Tillett and Clare Williamson.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaddermarket Theatre\nTheatre Royal, Norwich\nSewell Park\nNorwich Playhouse\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSewell Barn Theatre website",

            "content": "The Royal Automobile Club International Grand Prix was a motor race held on 2 October 1948, at Silverstone Airfield, Northamptonshire, UK. Although it did not have official Grande \u00c9preuve status, it is commonly cited as the first British Grand Prix of the modern era.\nHeld two years before the inauguration of the FIA World Championship of Drivers, the 65-lap race was run under the new Formula One regulations which effectively replaced the pre-war Grand Prix motor racing standards. Winner was the Italian Luigi Villoresi, in a Maserati 4CLT/48. A 13-lap 500 cc race, preceding the Grand Prix, was won by Spike Rhiando in a Cooper. Stirling Moss failed to finish after mechanical problems.\nThe race meeting marked the opening of the Silverstone Circuit, although at the time the site was only on a one-year loan to the RAC from the Air Ministry, having been a bomber station during World War II.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Royal Automobile Club had previously run two International Grands Prix at the banked Brooklands circuit, in Surrey, in 1926 and 1927, and the Donington Park circuit had hosted four non-ranking Grands Prix between 1935 and 1939, but with the hiatus caused by the Second World War motorsport in Britain had lost ground to continental countries. Its two major race circuits were unusable, with Donington still littered with detritus from its wartime role as a supply depot, while the Brooklands circuit had been a major centre for aircraft development during the war and much of the track had been built over. With the abundance of redundant airfields in the years following the end of hostilities, however, there were plenty of potential venues for new race circuits. One such was at RAF Silverstone, a former bomber station.\n\n\n=== The circuit ===\nThe Royal Automobile Club took a one-year lease on the Silverstone airfield site in early 1948 and set about creating a race track. The airfield conformed to the standard model for WWII RAF sites: three long, wide runways formed a triangle, their ends joined by a narrow perimeter roadway. In this inaugural year the RAC decided to lay out a relatively long circuit, using the full lengths of the two longest runways, as well as large portions of the perimeter road.\nThe competitors started on the western perimeter road and headed north towards a right-hand turn, the high-speed Woodcote Corner. From there the track used the northern edge of the perimeter to a sharp right turn onto the main runway at Copse Corner. Then came the main runway, known for the race as Segrave Straight, with the track continuing to the point at which the two largest runways intersected. Here, in an attempt to better emulate a true road circuit, the course designers narrowed the track with hay bales, which funnelled the cars into a 130\u00b0 left hairpin bend onto the second runway. At the end of the second runway the cars rejoined the perimeter road, just before the old Becketts Corner, before continuing on the long straight road in front of the main aircraft hangar complex, known appropriately as Hangar Straight.\nAt the end of the straight at what is now Stowe Corner, competitors rejoined the main runway (this southern portion now named the Seaman Straight), and headed back towards the central hairpin complex. Once again, at the intersection of the two runways the track was narrowed, before a left-hand hairpin onto the second runway, heading back out to the perimeter road. The perimeter road was rejoined at Club Corner. From this point the track once again headed north towards the finish line, passing through the flat-out Abbey Curve en route. Total track length was approximately 3.7 miles (5.9 km), substantially longer than the 2.9 miles (4.7 km) of Silverstone's classic layout, and longer even than the current 3.2-mile (5.1 km) circuit design. This was the only Grand Prix event ever held on this track layout, as from 1949 onward Silverstone circuits used only the perimeter roads. To commemorate the opening of this new circuit, all drivers completing either the Grand Prix or 500 cc race received the RAC Silverstone Plaque. Despite the interim and improvised nature of the Silverstone site, the event attracted in excess of 100,000 spectators.\n\n\n=== Grand Prix entrants ===\n\nThe entry list for the 65-lap Grand Prix was very mixed. Brand new, full works cars were entered by Maserati, Talbot-Lago and Ferrari, while the majority of the remaining field was made up of privateer entrants, mostly running pre-war cars. The organisers were particularly pleased to have attracted entries from leading continental firm Maserati; two of their brand new 4CLT/48 Sanremo models were entered: a works car for Luigi Villoresi, and one by British privateer Reg Parnell. A third 4CLT/48 was later entered for a second factory driver, Alberto Ascari, and a fourth as a reserve in the hands of local driver Leslie Brooke. Four Talbot-Lago T26C cars were also entered, including one for pre-war star driver Louis Chiron, and a fifth held in reserve, entered by Lord Selsdon. Although Scuderia Ferrari entered two of its Ferrari 125s, the team decided at the last minute to concentrate their efforts on mainland Europe and did not arrive.\nOf the older vehicles, two of the most notable were the Maserati 4CLs from the Scuderia Plat\u00e9 and White Mouse Stable teams. These cars were to be driven by Toulo de Graffenried and Prince Bira respectively, both previously winners of major races. The ERA marque, well represented among the local privateers, was bolstered by a factory entry from the firm's progenitor Raymond Mays. Another significant ERA entry was that of David Hampshire who drove R1A, the first ERA car to be constructed, dating from 1934. Leslie Johnson, owner of ERA in 1948, entered and drove one of the firm's 1939 E-type models. Although Peter Walker was also entered in an E-type, the car was unavailable on race day so he reverted to his own B-type, R10B.\nNotable by their absence were the Alfa Romeo works team, who decided not to attend with their dominant 158 Alfetta cars. One Alfa oddity was on show, however: the 1935 Bimotore, albeit with only one of its two engines in operation, was driven by Tony Rolt, an ex-Colditz prisoner of war and the future developer of four-wheel drive.\n\n\n==== Entry list ====\n1 Late entry, assumed the running number of non-arrival Giuseppe Farina.\n(r) Reserve entry.\n\n\n== RAC 500 cc race ==\nThe main Grand Prix event was supported by a race for 500 cc (later to become Formula 3) cars. It was dominated by privateer Cooper entries that included future Grand Prix star Stirling Moss and John Cooper himself, both driving the new MkII. Future four-time British Hill Climb Champion Ken Wharton was also in the running, driving his self-built 500 cc special, in a strong field of well over 30 cars.\nDespite the prestigious occasion \u2013 running two hours before the main Grand Prix event, the 500 cc race was actually the first ever competitive race on the Silverstone Circuit \u2013 the start was something of a shambles. When British Racing Drivers' Club President Lord Howe dropped the starting flag only two of the 34 drivers were ready to begin. Eric Brandon \u2013 an experienced 500 cc driver, and the first to win a 500 cc race in Britain \u2013 was not even seated in his car, but recovered to finish fifth. Moss had dominated the British 500 cc race season up to this point, but his car lost drive during the race and challenger Spike Rhiando won in his Cooper MkII. John Cooper was second, and the 58-year-old Baronet of Bodicote, Sir Francis Samuelson (also a Cooper MkII driver) took third.\n\n\n== Grand Prix ==\n\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nThe works Maserati 4CLTs were delayed on their way to Silverstone, and in their absence qualifying was dominated by Monegasque driver Chiron, in his Ecurie France-run Talbot-Lago. He took pole position with a time of 2:56.0, a second clear of de Graffenried's Maserati in second place. Third was the Talbot-Lago of Philippe \u00c9tancelin, a further second behind de Graffenried. Despite driving a car a decade older than those in front of him, Bob Gerard managed to put his ERA R14B into fourth position, only two-tenths of a second behind \u00c9tancelin, with Johnson's ERA E-type in fifth. Having missed official practice, the Maseratis of Villoresi and Ascari were forced to start at the back of the field, in 24th and 25th positions respectively, but in unofficial practice immediately before the race Ascari posted a lap of 2:54.6, over a second faster than Chiron's pole position time.\n\n\n=== Race ===\nAt the start, de Graffenried got away from the line fastest, but he was passed by Chiron, Parnell and Johnson before the first corner at Woodcote. This group was followed by Bira, \u00c9tancelin and Gerard. As the leaders entered Woodcote Johnson drew level with the leader, Chiron, but at that moment the driveshaft on Johnson's ERA failed, causing its immediate retirement. Further back in the field, Salvadori went straight to his pit box from the start, to attend to an oiled spark plug. The stop cost him half a lap, and put him into last position. In the early corners Parnell was close behind Chiron, in second place, but his month-old Maserati dropped out on the first lap after a flying stone tore out the drain plug of his fuel tank.\nBy the end of the second lap the Maseratis of Villoresi and Ascari, showing their superior pace and benefiting from retirements, had made their way through the field and were close on Chiron's tail. On lap three both passed Chiron, and Villoresi took the lead. Later on the same lap Italian privateer Gianfranco Comotti joined the early retirees, when his Talbot's brakes failed. Another driver whose brakes fared badly was B. Bira, who dropped back into the pack because of them, after having pressed the leaders in the opening few laps. Rolt's single-engined Bimotore Alfa Romeo lost the use of that remaining motor on lap 6, and Rolt was forced to retire. Geoffrey Ansell's ERA R9B rolled on lap 23, throwing Ansell out of the car. He was unscathed.\nAs the race progressed de Graffenried dropped yet further back, as his engine went out of tune and started to overheat, and he eventually finished six laps behind the winners. The other early leader, Chiron, started to suffer from a lack of performance in his Talbot on lap 17, and Bira slipped ahead of him into third place. Gerard sat in fifth place, after \u00c9tancelin's engine began to overheat, which dropped him back down the field as he was forced to make successive pit stops to top up his radiator fluid, and he eventually retired on lap 22. Chiron dropped even further back after spending 45 seconds in the pits investigating the poor handling of his Talbot, and he eventually retired with a seized gearbox on lap 37. Gerard passed Bira during refuelling pit stops, his pit crew completing the task four seconds faster than Bira's. However, Louis Rosier slipped past both of them as he did not need to stop for fuel. Gerard eventually caught Rosier again on lap 52, and passed him to take third place.\n\nThe works Maseratis were never more than a few seconds apart, and they regularly swapped the lead between them. On laps 27 and 29, respectively, Villoresi and Ascari came into the pits to refuel. During his stop, Ascari also replaced both rear wheels of his Maserati, and the extra time taken for this stop put him 50 seconds behind his team mate, but he retained second place. He lost a further 16 seconds to Villoresi during the second round of pit stops, putting him almost a full minute behind the leader at that point. However, Villoresi, who posted the fastest lap of the race (2:52.0), suffered an unusual mishap when his tachometer's fixings failed and the unit fell out of the Maserati's dashboard. In addition to not now knowing the speed of his engine, the tachometer lodged underneath Villoresi's clutch pedal and prevented him from using the clutch for the remainder of the race. Despite this, Villoresi managed to hold on to the lead and proved the eventual winner, 14 seconds ahead of Ascari and half a lap ahead of Gerard. The only other finisher on the same lap as the leaders, but only a few seconds from being lapped, was Rosier's Talbot-Lago.\n\n\n=== Classification ===\nResults sources: Project 009900; The Motor, Oct. 1948\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nProgramme of the Royal Automobile Club International Grand Prix and \"500 cc.\" National Race at the Silverstone Circuit Saturday, 2 October 1948.

            "content": "Dipolog, officially the City of Dipolog, (Cebuano: Dakbayan sa Dipolog; Filipino: Lungsod ng Dipolog; Chavacano: Ciudad de Dipolog; Subanen: Gembagel G'benwa Dipuleg/Bagbenwa Dipuleg), is a 3rd class city and capital of the province of Zamboanga del Norte, Philippines. According to the 2015 census, it has a population of 130,759 people.\nGeographically, the city is surrounded by rolling hills to the southeast and the Sulu Sea to the north. Dipolog is known for its wild orchids and its sardine industry which stems from the rich fishing area off its shores. It is known as the \"Gateway to Western Mindanao\" through the Western Nautical Highway and has also been called the \"Bottled Sardines Capital of the Philippines.\"\nDipolog can be reached by plane via Dipolog Airport or by ferry at the nearby Pulauan Port in Dapitan City. The construction of a roll-on/roll-off facility at Barangay Galas will allow for the eventual transfer of the service to Dipolog while retaining inter-island operations at Pulauan, which is soon to become a base port.\nA popular city attraction is the foreshore Dipolog Boulevard which, though still in its second phase of construction, has become a popular haven for exercise and leisure. It is also the site for various celebrations and festivals in the city. In the third phase of the project, the length of the boulevard will be extended to reach the seaport in Barangay Galas.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nDipolog City is known to be as the \"Gateway to Western Mindanao\" it is situated in the Northwestern part of the Province of Zamboanga del Norte. It is bounded on the north by Dapitan City, on the east by the Municipality of Polanco, on the south by the Municipality of Sergio Osme\u00f1a Sr. and on the west by the Municipality of Katipunan.\nIts land area in 1914 covered an approximate land area of 248,587 hectares under Act No. 302 of the Philippine Islands. It was substantially reduced in 1951 to the current 13,628 hectares, after two barrios of Dipolog were converted into Municipalities of Polanco, and Pi\u00f1an under Executive Order of the President No. 467, dated August 22, 1951.\n\n\n=== Barangays ===\nDipolog City is politically subdivided into 21 barangays.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Spanish regime ===\nEarliest recorded political history of Dipolog started in 1834 with the re-organization of Spanish Civil Government. At that time, Tulwanan's political territory was still part of the Municipality of Dapitan with Don Domingo Ruiz, a native, as its capit\u00e1n or town executive. Sometime that year, a Spanish Recollect missionary arrived in Tulwanan looking for its barrio executive or local chieftain. Upon meeting a native, the missionary asked; \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el capit\u00e1n?\". The native understanding only the word \"capit\u00e1n\" pointed to the west and said in Subanen Di-pag, meaning across the river. Guided by his servant, a Tagalog boy named Antonio Subido, the missionary proceeded down river and upon reaching the Boholano settlement, named the place \"Dipag\".\nTechnically, Dipag and Tulwanan were two different settlements at that time with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified the location of the larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards pronounced it in Spanish accent Dipolog which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter 'L' written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan's political identity ceased to exist. By the 12th century the Subanen settlers had colonized most of what is now Zamboanga Peninsula region. It was customary for tribes to establish their settlements at the mouth of large river systems due to the abundant food supply. However, due to frequent raids from seafaring Chinese pirates, they decided to move their settlements inland.\nIn the 14th century, Tulwanan was established 6 kilometers inland, adjoining the river near the present day barangay center of Lugdungan.\nIn the 15th century, settlers from neighboring Negros and Bohol islands established coastline settlements in Mindanao but suffered the same raids by Chinese pirates, prompting them to also move their settlements away from the coastline. They established another settlement in what is now called Sianib, a barangay of present-day Polanco town, some twenty kilometers from the coast at Barrio Gulayon(Barangay Gulayon).\nIt was only in 1563 that the first recorded Visayan settlement of some 800 families from Bohol, led by the chieftain Datu Pagbuaya, landed in Mindanao and established a coastal settlement in what is now called Dapitan. This settlement was strong enough to repel the Chinese pirates of the Sulu Sea. As a result, Dapitan Bay was scene of many bloody conflicts between Pagbuaya's men and Chinese pirates.\n\n\n=== Mindanao's first Christian settlement ===\nIn 1565, Don Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi who was accompanied by famed navigator Fr. Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta, an Augustinian friar, visited the Boholano chieftain Datu Pagbuaya on the invitation of Datu Sikatuna. There they found the place of Datu Pagbuaya to be a thriving settlement. In his chronicle, Fr. Urdaneta named the place Daquepitan. Peter Kaerius (Pieter van den Keere) identified the location as Dapito in his cartographic map of 1598. It was later identified as \"Dapite\" in Robert Dudley's map of 1646. Other names ascribed to the location include \"Dapyto\" in Sanson's map of 1652 and \"Dapitan\" which can be found in Moll's map of the East Indies, 1729 and in Murillo Velarde\u2019s map of 1734. After Legazpi's visit, the Christianization of Mindanao was officially initiated by the Augustinian friars who arrived with him.\nIn 1581, members of The Society of Jesus came to the Philippines for the purpose of evangelization. When the country was divided among four religious orders in 1598, the Jesuits were given the Diocese of Cebu which covered the Visayas and Mindanao. Thus Dapitan came to be under the jurisdiction of the courageous men of St. Ignatius and it was Father Pascual de Acu\u00f1a S.J. who started the Jesuit mission there.\nIn 1609, the squadron of Juan Juarez Gallinato S.J. defeated the Manguindanau Muslims in a ferocious battle near Dapitan.\nAlso in 1609, a permanent Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter headed by a Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao. Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, Iligan, Basilan and Butuan. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained untouched by the Spanish Cross.\n\nBy the 18th century, with the Spanish Naval Fleet anchored at Dapitan Bay, much of the piracy\u2014now conducted mainly by moro bandits\u2014was under control within the Sulu Sea. Settlement in coastal areas resumed with new settlers from Negros and Bohol eventually settling in Isab, and Nipaan. The largest settlement, however, was made at the mouth of the Dipolog river by the Boholanos who were not associated with Pagbuaya.\nFrom Ruiz, civil administration changed hands in stable succession, with Martino Belarmino, who was popular by the name Maglinte. Francisco Magallanes, Victorio Gobune; another man whose name history record had as Toribio had his chance, followed by Venancio Narvaez, Francisco Orbita, Bautista Narvaez, Martencio Yebes and Sabino Bengua.\nBy 1889, administrative designations reverted to Capitanes, and those appointed were Martin Fernandez, Tomas Narvacan, Eustaquio Cajocon, Simplicio Lacaya, Basilio Tabiliran, Maximiano Ruiz and Bruno Ordinaria in 1898.\nBy February 1894, the Catholic Chapel constructed by the Jesuits was renovated for the first time, on an altar designed by Dr. Jos\u00e9 Rizal to which now stands the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral.\nBy 1896, the friars established Dipolog as a regular parish and installed Father Esteban Yepes its first administrator in 1897.\n\n\n=== American regime ===\nAfter the transfer of Spanish sovereignty to the United States in 1897, the U.S. occupation forces renamed the Capitan to Presidente Local, with administrative support from a Vice Presidente Local, a Delegado de Justicia and a Delegado de Policia. Martin Fernandez was appointed Presidente Local in the year 1900, followed by Diosdado Mercado, Gaudencio Zorilla and Isidro Patangan as Presidente Municipal between 1901 and March 1904.\nBy 1900, Dipolog was a thriving commercial community with new settlers arriving from the island of Cebu, outgrowing its principal town of Dapitan which exclusively remained part of Pagbuaya's clan.\nBy 1910, John Helper, who was previously appointed Secretary of Zamboanga Province, visited Dipolog for two days and conversed with its principal\u00eda and members of the Centro Catolico de Dipolog. He was asked later of the possibility of converting the community to an independent Municipality.\nBy 1912, Gov. John J. Pershing of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu decreed the separation of Dipolog from Dapitan.\nBy July 1, 1913, Gov. John J. Pershing declared Dipolog as a Municipality. General Pershing also appointed Pascual T. Martinez as its first Municipal Mayor.\nThe first public school teachers of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly Maribojoc and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One of them was a certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Coro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined whether or not the residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.\n\n\n=== Japanese regime ===\nIn 1942, Japanese Imperial Occupation forces entered in Dipolog and built of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Army was stationed in the municipality. In the same year, the seat of government of the historical province of Zamboanga was transferred from Zamboanga City to Dipolog.\nIn 1942 to 1945, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units and the local recognized guerrillas began the conflicts in the town municipality of Dipolog against the Japanese Imperial forces during the occupation was until the retreating the local resistance fighters was halted by the Japanese are almost four years during the siege and before the American liberation forces was returned and arrive the town by the enemy.\nIn 1945, the liberation by the Filipino troops under the 6th, 10th, 102nd and 105th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary entered in Dipolog together with local guerrillas.\nGovernor Matias Castillon Ranillo Sr. noticed that the waters at Punta Coro wharf were choppy for ships to anchor. Governor Ranillo was determined to provide an alternative access to southern Zamboanga peninsula. Governor Ranillo's jurisdiction was then the entire Zamboanga peninsula prior to its division between del Norte and del Sur. During Governor Ranillo's term, aviation was a young technology but he made sure that an airfield was established in Dipolog.\nHe was elected Governor in 1937 and re-elected in 1940 but his term was cut short when Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon urged him to run as the lone Assemblyman of Zamboanga peninsula. President Quezon fondly called him \"El Gallo Escondido de Malacanang\". In November 1941, he was elected as Assemblyman but one week before his scheduled departure for Manila, World War II broke out. On October 30, 1944, upon the request of the recognized guerrillas among them the local regular and constable force of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary during the conflicts against the occupation, he mobilized the able-bodied men of Dipolog and Home guards who cheerfully volunteered to clear the airfield of grass and shrubs.\nOn March 8, 1945, on Dipolog airfield, the first American invasion of Zamboanga peninsula took place. The successful landing at Dipolog airfield established a base for the subsequent recapture of Japanese-held San Roque airfield near Zamboanga City, followed by Sanga Sanga in Sulu, and from there to Borneo and the East Indies. The established of the general headquarters and military camp base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary were stationed in Dipolog on March 9, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during and aftermath of World War II.\n\n\n=== Philippine Republic and Cityhood ===\n\nIn 1952, Zamboanga province is separated into two provinces of Zamboanga del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur through Republic Act 711. Dipolog became the capital of Zamboanga del Norte upon creation.\nBy June 21, 1969, Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed into law Republic Act 5520 or \"Charter of the City of Dipolog\", making Dipolog a chartered city effective January 1, 1970. The date is both significant and historic as that coincided with the Apollo 11 launching which carried the first men to the moon on June 21, 1969. Mayor Felicisimo Herrera was made the last Municipal Mayor (1963\u20131970) and the first City Mayor of Dipolog (1970\u20131978). On March 8, 1982 the Sangguniang Panlungsod adopted the Dipolog City March composed by Mrs. Antonina O. Romano as the City's official song.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe city is now one of the major options for local investors from Cebu, Dumaguete, Cagayan de Oro and Davao and for foreign nationalities from India and Taiwan investing in retail, tourism, services, manufacturing, trade, and wholesale. It is also abundant with natural resources in terms of agriculture with fishpond areas and fishing grounds; fish production with approximately 56 fish species being produced, as well as livestock production such as carabao, cattle, horse, goat and pig.\nPotential investment areas range from agri-based processing such as activated charcoal, desiccated coconut, broiler contract growing, livestock raising, cattle fattening; construction, furniture, marble, low-cost housing projects, feed mill; food processing or packaging such as meat and fish processing, mango processing and packaging.\nIn 2006, a study by the National Statistics Coordination Board (NSCB) found Dipolog City to be the wealthiest city per capita in the Zamboanga Peninsula. Within Dipolog, 23.15% of the population was estimated to be living below the poverty line (households with a per capita expenditure of under $1 a day). In comparison, the NCSB estimated Zamboanga City and Pagadian City as having poverty incidences of 23.81% and 27.15%, respectively. In startling contrast, the poverty rate for the entire province of Zamboanga del Norte (with individuals in both rural and urban settings) was estimated to be 40.36%. Zamboanga del Norte is one of the Philippines's poorest provinces with a poverty incidence rate of 64.6% in 2003, an increase from 47% in the 2000 statistical figures.\n\n\n=== Technology ===\nCurrently, the city is well equipped with telecommunication facilities from landlines, mobile networks, 3G broadband.\n\n\n=== Retail ===\nLocal malls and shopping centers in Dipolog City includes Roy Plaza, Dipolog Shopping Center Lee Plaza Dipolog (also known as Lee Plaza City Central Dipolog) in the downtown area, and the upcoming CityMall Dipolog at the national highway of Barangay Sta. Filomena.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nDipolog shared much of its cultural history with the ancient town of Dapitan to which it once belonged. It traces its beginnings long before the Spanish conquistadores set foot on the island of Mindanao. Dipolog was previously known as Tulwanan, in native language, literally meaning a settlement by the river. Its earliest settlers all belonged to the Subanen Tribe called Subanon or river people with established religion founded in animism. These descended from the Austronesian peoples who roamed Mindanao and Southeast Asia via land bridges as early as 30,000 years ago Later migrations of other tribes were made by water and took place over several thousand years.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nTricycles, sikads, and habal-habals are the primary modes of transportation in the city.\n\n\n=== By Land ===\nDipolog has its own bus terminal in Barangay Miputak. It provides daily trip to any places in Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City, Cagayan de Oro City and Misamis Occidental.\n\n\n=== By Water ===\nDipolog used to rely in the nearby Port of Pulauan in Dapitan City, especially for trips bound to Dumaguete City and Cebu City. The city can now be reached through Cebu-based Medallion Transport Inc. Docking port is at the Dipolog City Feeder Port in Barangay Galas. Dipolog City to Cebu City Everyday execpt Saturday at 7:00pm and Cebu City to Dipolog City Everyday at 8:30pm Vessel Operated :M/V Lady of Joy and M/V Lady of Good Voyage\n\n\n=== By Air ===\n\nDipolog Airport (IATA: DPL, ICAO: RPMG) is the city's domestic airport located in Barangay Minaog.

After Ideal was sold in 1982, Marx took over the game. By the late 1980s, the game was out of production. In 2003 Mattel rereleased Battling Tops.\nThe game has similarities to gasing pangkah, a traditional Malay sport. [1]\n\n\n== Game play ==\nTwo to four players launch spinning tops into an arena. The object of the game is to have the last standing spinning top. The game takes place on a circular concave arena with four spinning top launch positions. Players wind a string (attached to a pull tab) around their tops, place them in the launch positions, then pull the tab vigorously to release the top. The concave surface forces the tops together to battle. The outcome is somewhat indeterminate, but there is a slight element of skill. Pegs in holes on the rim of the arena mark victories. The first to win ten battles wins the game.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nThere were eight different colored tops to choose from, although as noted only four could battle at one time. The tops were composed of octagonal discs slipped over a ridged shaft that had a notch to engage the string. The game came with a sheet of coloured stickers to place on the discs. Ostensibly the stickers were to match the colour of the disc and the shaft, but it was possible to mix and match shafts, discs, and stickers (with the proviso that the stickers only stuck once). In the new version of the game, Smarty Smitty has been replaced by Cyclone Steve. In the 1968 version there was an 8 top version that included Fighting Frank and Rocky Rocko. The six player sets had red, yellow, green, light blue, white, and orange. Some sets have rarer colors. There is a 1986 version with a red arena that included 8 tops.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBeyblade\nBattle Strikers",

            "content": "David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon (born 3 November 1961), styled as Viscount Linley until 2017 and known professionally as David Linley, is an English furniture maker and the former chairman of the auction house Christie's UK. The son of Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, he is a grandson of King George VI and is 18th in line of succession to the British throne, the first in line who is not a descendant of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSnowdon was baptized on 19 December 1961 in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace. His godparents are: Queen Elizabeth II, Lady Elizabeth Cavendish, Patrick Plunket, 7th Baron Plunket, Lord Rupert Nevill, and Reverend Simon Phipps who was later Bishop of Lincoln.\nAt the age of five, Snowdon started lessons in the Buckingham Palace schoolroom with his cousin Prince Andrew. He went to several independent schools: first, to Gibbs Pre-Preparatory School in Kensington in London, followed by the pre-preparatory section of Ashdown House School, East Sussex, then on to Millbrook House School, near Abingdon, in Oxfordshire, and finally to Bedales School, where he developed a passion for arts and crafts. From 1980 to 1982 he studied at Parnham House in the small town of Beaminster in Dorset, for craftsmen in wood.\n\n\n== Professional life ==\n\nSnowdon opened a workshop in Dorking, where he designed and made furniture for three years before setting up his own company, David Linley Furniture Limited (now known as Linley), where he makes bespoke furniture, upholstery, and interior design products known for their neoclassical appearance and use of inlaid woods. He has written numerous books and lectured around the world. His work is sold in retail stores in Belgravia, Harrods and overseas including the Bespoke Collection. He borrowed from his company by making loans to a subsidiary company, acquiring some \u00a33 million in debts, a situation eventually resolved by the sale of controlling shares for \u00a34 million in 2012. The consequence, however, is that he is no longer CEO.\nOn 1 December 2006, Snowdon took up the post of chairman of Christie's UK, having joined the board in 2005 as a non-executive director. In 2015, his position was changed to honorary chairman of Christie's EMERI (Europe, Middle East, Russia, and India).\nIn the distant past, Snowdon dabbled in the restaurant business. As a young man, he partnered with his friend and cousin Patrick Lichfield to establish a restaurant called Deals in Chelsea, London. According to Princess Margaret's biographer, Theo Aronson, Snowdon had a flair for the networking aspect of business and was, therefore, extremely successful in getting people to come through the doors. Within a few years' time, he was already establishing a second restaurant.\n\n\n== Personal life and family ==\nSnowdon had romances with Susannah Constantine, Kate Menzies, and Nicola Formby. On 8 October 1993, he married the Hon. Serena Alleyne Stanhope, a daughter of Viscount Petersham (later the 12th Earl of Harrington), at St. Margaret's Church, Westminster. There were 650 guests in attendance, including Elton John, Diana, Princess of Wales, Jerry Hall, the Aga Khan, and ex-King Constantine of Greece. In addition, there were an estimated 5,000 spectators in the streets.\nSnowdon and his wife have two children:\nCharles Patrick Inigo Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley (born 1 July 1999)\nLady Margarita Elizabeth Rose Alleyne Armstrong-Jones (born 14 May 2002)\nSnowdon has one full sister, Lady Sarah Chatto (n\u00e9e Armstrong-Jones), and one paternal half-sister, Lady Frances von Hofmannsthal (n\u00e9e Armstrong-Jones). Snowdon also has a half-brother, Jasper Cable-Alexander, son of his father and Melanie Cable-Alexander, an editor at Country Life magazine.\nFrom 2000 until 2002, Snowdon, his wife and son lived at Kensington Palace with his mother, Princess Margaret, in her declining years. On 8 April 2002, Snowdon, along with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York, and the Earl of Wessex, stood guard at the lying-in-state of their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. This was a mark of respect unofficially known as the Vigil of the Princes, which had taken place only once before, during the lying-in-state of King George V in 1936.\nIn October/November 2007, rumors circulated on the internet suggesting that a member of the British royal family was the victim of blackmail. The first confirmation that the royal in the extortion attempt was indeed Viscount Linley, as Snowdon was known at the time, came from the journalist Nicholas Davies. Ian Strachan and Sean McGuigan tried to exhort \u00a350,000 from Snowdon in September by threatening to release video footage showing sex acts and cocaine use (allegedly by Snowdon and a royal aide) on a mobile phone. Snowdon contacted the police. Strachan and McGuigan were arrested after showing their video footage to an undercover detective. Strachan and McGuigan were sentenced to five years in prison.\nIn 2011, Snowdon's daughter, Margarita Armstrong-Jones, was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. In 2012, Snowdon's son, now Viscount Linley, was appointed by The Queen as a Page of Honour.\nThe Snowdons have three homes: a flat in Chelsea, London; a cottage on the Daylesford estate in Gloucestershire; and the Chateau d'Autet in the Luberon, Provence.\nHis father, Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, died on 13 January 2017 and he assumed the title, thus becoming the 2nd Earl of Snowdon.\n\n\n=== Serena Armstrong-Jones, Countess of Snowdon ===\nSerena Alleyne Armstrong-Jones, Countess of Snowdon (n\u00e9e Stanhope; born 1 March 1970) is an Anglo-Irish aristocrat and a niece-in-law of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.\n\n\n==== Family ====\nSerena Stanhope was born in Limerick, Ireland. She is the daughter of Charles Stanhope, 12th Earl of Harrington, and the former Virginia Freeman Jackson. Her parents divorced when she was 13 years old. Through her father, she descends from Charles II of England's illegitimate child, Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, which makes her a distant cousin of Diana, Princess of Wales and her husband.\n\n\n==== Marriage and children ====\nThe marriage between Serena Stanhope and David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon (at that time Viscount Linley), son of Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, was held on 8 October 1993 at St. Margaret's Church, Westminster. The bride's diamond engagement ring and wedding band are from Wartski. She wore a dress designed by Bruce Robbins, noted for its resemblance to Princess Margaret's 1960 Norman Hartnell wedding dress. Her going-away outfit was designed by Robinson Valentine.\n\n\n==== Career ====\nIn 2010, she opened Serena Linley Provence, a shop selling soaps, scent and candles using lavender from Provence, where the Linleys have a home, the Chateau d'Autet in the Luberon. The shop closed in late 2014.\n\n\n== Published works ==\nLinley, David. Classical Furniture. Harry N. Abrams, 1993. ISBN 978-0810931886.\nLinley, David. Extraordinary Furniture. Harry N.

At the time of his birth, he was fifth in the line of succession to the British throne; he is currently in eighteenth place and is the first person in the line of succession who is not a descendant of Elizabeth II.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLinley website\nLinley designed suites at the Hotel Baltschug Kempinski Moscow\nLinley designed suites at Claridge's\nDavid Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley (1961\u2013), Son of Princess Margaret Rose and 1st Earl of Snowdon (National Portrait Gallery photographs)",
