He went to an academy in Poughkeepsie, New York, completed school at the age of sixteen and then studied law, first with a private attorney and then at the New York State Law School, from which he graduated in 1854.\nSlauson spent nine years as an attorney in New York City, but ill health impelled him to move to Austin, Nevada, in 1864, where he became a miner and was also elected mayor. Later, he resumed his law practice, this time in partnership with Charles E. De Long. Between 1868 and 1874 he lived with his family in San Francisco, California.\nIn the latter year the Slausons moved to Los Angeles, where he founded the Los Angeles County Bank, which he sold to John E. Plater.\n\nSlauson purchased about 5,800 acres of land east of Los Angeles and was once called \"the father of citrus fruit culture in the foothill region\" and \"the father of the town of Azusa\" because of his holdings in the Azusa region. In 1886, he sold half the acreage to J.D. Bicknell, I.W. Hellman and others and retained 800 acres, which he incorporated as the Azusa Land and Water Company and laid out the design of a town. He also planted \"Orange and lemon trees of the choicest budded varieties.\" He also became a landowner in Ontario, California, and in Los Angeles.\nSlauson, who was president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce and the Sunset Club, a social organization, contributed to establishing and assisting churches throughout Southern California. His other charities included the Boys' Home at Garvanza, the Los Angeles YMCA, a Los Angeles orphan asylum, the Salvation Army Rescue Home, and he raised a fund for the erection of a monument to Spanish\u2013American War veterans in Central Park, now known as Pershing Square.\nHe was elected to the Los Angeles Board of Education on December 5, 1904 for a two-year term, but he resigned on September 23, 1905.\nSlauson died December 28, 1905 and was survived by three children, Mrs. Louise Marshall (wife of Hugh Livingstone Macneil), Mrs. Kate Vosburg and James Slauson. Thousands of people attended along the route of the funeral cortege and in the vestibule of the City Hall, where Slauson's body lay in state. The procession to St. Paul's Pro-Cathedral was accompanied by a detachment of militia. After a private service at the family home, 2345 South Figueroa Street, interment was at Rosedale Cemetery\n\n\n=== Slauson Avenue ===\nThe street Slauson Avenue was posthumously named and dedicated to him.\n\n\n== References ==",

The church was designed by architect A. W. N. Pugin\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was designed by Augustus Pugin in 1837 to replace a small Gothic building in nearby Chapel Street. It was Pugin's first expression of his Gothic Revival style. He originally planned for the tower to have a 100 feet (30 m) spire, but budget restrictions prevented this from being implemented. His final design was presented on 17 March 1838, and construction began that same year, with the foundation stone being laid in July 1838. Building was completed by 9 October 1839, when the dedication service took place. The cost of construction had been \u00a31,400. The wood sedilia in the sanctuary was donated to the church by Pugin.\nEight years later St Alkmund's Church was built on a site directly opposite St Mary's. The position of the larger St Alkmund's was such that the view of St Mary's from King Street was totally obscured.\nIn 1850, a chapel was added dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes. Some years later a floodlit statue of Mary was placed on the tower, forming a landmark, although it has subsequently been removed. The church was partially restored in 1927 when it was discovered that damp had taken hold on much of the plasterwork. St Mary's was enlarged slightly in 1932 with the building of the Lady Chapel and several pieces of stonework were added to both the interior and the exterior of the building.\nThe late 1960s brought sweeping changes to the Derby landscape. St Alkmund's Church and its churchyard were demolished in order to make way for the inner ring road, exposing St Mary's to full view for the first time in 120 years.\nA new set of bells was added during a facelift which took place between April 1988 and September 1989, during which the church was closed. A second restoration was undertaken in the late 1990s. This included re-roofing of the Lady Chapel and extensive cleaning of the interior and exterior of the church.\nIn 2007 the bridge that allows pedestrians to cross the A52 (St Alkmund's Way) was replaced with a wider design at a cost of \u00a31.3m.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSt Mary's Parish official website",

Its purpose was to provide an initial infrastructure of software and services for users of Amstrad's range of home computers, the Amstrad CPC and, from 1986, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. Many people's first contact with software on an Amstrad home computer would have been an Amsoft title, as several titles were included in the sales bundles.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile developing its first home computer, the Amstrad CPC464, Amstrad assessed that part of the success of its competitors' machines was the backing of a grown infrastructure of software and services. Being a newcomer to the computer market, Amstrad decided to artificially create this infrastructure for the launch of their own computers. In February 1984, Amstrad founded its Amsoft division headed by Roland Perry and William Poel who at the time were also overseeing the development of the Amstrad CPC464 itself.\nMost prominently, Amsoft acted as the first-party game and business software publisher for Amstrad computers. Most of its software products were licensed from various third-party developers and published under the Amsoft label. This also provided a risk-free means for established software studios to try out their products in the emerging Amstrad CPC market. In addition to publishing software, Amsoft was tasked with press relations and consumer promotion, most notably creating and maintaining the Amstrad User Club and publishing its periodical, the CPC464 User (later Amstrad Computer User).\nWhen a reliable third-party support had been established, Amsoft gradually faded out the publishing of software and sold the Amstrad User Club as well as the user magazine. By 1989, Amsoft was fully integrated with the main Amstrad corporation and ceased to exist as a separate entity.\n\n\n== List of games ==\n\n\n=== 1984 ===\nAmerican Football\nAstro Attack\nBlagger\nBridge-It\nElectro Freddy\nFruit Machine\nThe Galactic Plague\nHarrier Attack\nHaunted Hedges\nHunchback\nLaserwarp\nMr Wong's Loopy Laundry\nMutant Monty\nOh Mummy\nPunchy\nQuack-a-Jack\nRoland Ahoy\nRoland on the Ropes\nRoland in the Caves\nRoland Goes Digging\nRoland Goes Square Bashing\nRoland on the Run\nSpannerman\nSpace Hawks\nSultan's Maze\nPyjamarama\nDetective\nXanagrams\nAnimal Vegetable Mineral\nHappy Letters\nMap Rally\nTimeman One / L'Horloger 1\nWordhang\nFruit Machine\nAmsgolf\nCodename MAT\nHunter Killer\nSnooker\nL'Ardoise Magique\nLes Chiffres Magiques\nLe G\u00e9ographe - France\nLe G\u00e9ographe - Monde\nL'Horloger 2 / Timeman Two\nLes Lettres Magiques\nOsprey!\nStar Watcher\nAdmiral Graf Spee\n\n\n=== 1985 ===\n3D Grand Prix\nJet-Boot Jack\nAirwolf\nAssault on Port Stanley\nDoors of Doom\nDragon's Gold\nFrank 'n' Stein\nFriss Man\nFu-Kung in Las Vegas\nThe Game of Dragons\nThe Key Factor\nManic Miner\nThe Prize\nRoland in Time\nRoland in Space\nSeesaw\nSuper Pipeline 2\nSupertripper\nSorcery Plus\nCyrus 2 Chess\nMasterchess\nHappy Numbers\nStockmarket\nTraffic\n3D Boxing\n3D Stunt Rider\nAlex Higgins World Pool\nAlex Higgins' World Snooker\nGlen Hoddle Soccer\nRock Hopper\nStrangeloop Plus\nSubterranean Stryker\nTombstone\nKingdoms\nBraxx Bluff\nOverlord 2\nCampeones\nClassic Racing\nL'Apprenti Sorcier\nSatellite Warrior\n\n\n=== 1986 ===\nQabbalah\nHappy Writing\nNuclear Defence\nGolden Path\n6128 Games Collection\n\n\n=== 1987-1989 ===\nScalextric (1987)\nTank Command (1988)\nFantastic Voyage (1989)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",

            "content": "The Arcturus T-20 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a medium range, fully composite aircraft capable of internal and external payloads. Launched from a portable catapult, it can be recovered with a shipboard landing system, or belly land on unimproved surfaces. The T-20 carries a retractable gimbal-mounted, digitally stabilized, electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera that relays video in real time via a C-band LOS data link to the ground control station (GCS). Powered by a 4-stroke, fuel injected gasoline engine, the aircraft burns 2 lbs of fuel per hour at cruise. The T-20 does not require an airfield to operate and lands on dirt, grass, desert, or gravel roads. The internal payload bay (11\"x11\"x36\") allows for sensor arrays to be pre-assembled on 'payload pallets' that attach from the bottom of the aircraft. The T-20 system includes three aircraft, ground control station, portable launcher, and support trailer for equipment and personnel. The airframe is entirely composite with complex wet wings tested to stresses of 10 G's.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe Arcturus-UAV T-20 was privately developed in 2009 in Rohnert Park, California as an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform with payload capacity for a gimbal camera, and wing mounted drop pods. Flight testing of the prototype T-20 was completed at Edwards Air Force Base in February 2009. The first air drop test was completed in August 2009 at Camp Roberts California with payloads provided by the Naval Postgraduate School. October 2009 The T-20 flew air drops at the 2009 Precision Airdrop Technology Conference and Demonstration(PATCAD) at Yuma Proving Ground in support of the Naval Postgraduate School Snowflake guided para foil.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nIn March 2012, the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) included the Arcturus T-20 UAV in multi-award IDIQ contract N00019-12-D-0010 for ISR Services. Arcturus UAV, LLC is a subcontractor to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) under this contract.\nIn California on October 24, 2012, the Arcturus T-20 made aviation history as the first unmanned aerial vehicle to detect and avoid a general aviation manned aircraft using an ADS-B transponder. The event was sponsored by the Cascade Chapter of AUVSI.\nIn August 2013, the T-20 flew to an altitude of 23,500 feet (7,200 m) with no special modifications. The previous altitude record for the T-20 was 15,000 feet (4,600 m) The aircraft flew for eight hours before landing.\nThe T-20 and T-20 JUMP are deployed extensively with the Mexican Navy. The T-20 is also deployed with the Turkish government.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nVariations of the T-20 are the Block I (Carburetor) and Block II (Fuel Injected).\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nData from Arcturus UAV T-20\nGeneral characteristics\nCrew: 2 man ground crew\nLength: 9 ft 5 in (2.9 m)\nWingspan: 17 ft 6 in (5.3 m)\nHeight: 3.0 ft in (1 m)\nEmpty weight: 110 lb (50 kg)\nGross weight: 185 lb (84 kg)\nPowerplant: 1 \u00d7 1 Aviation Gasoline Avgas 110 LL 4 stroke internal combustion, 190cc, 10 hp (7.5 kW)\nPerformance\nMaximum speed: 86 mph (139 km/h)\nRange: 55 LOS miles (89 km)\nEndurance: 24+ hours\nService ceiling: 7,620 (rated), 25,000 (proven) ft (4,572 (rated), 25,000 (proven) m)\n\n\n== See also ==\nAeroVironment RQ-14 Dragon Eye\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle\nUnmanned combat aerial vehicle\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\nAAI RQ-7 Shadow\nBoeing Insitu RQ-21 Blackjack\nBoeing Insitu ScanEagle\nRelated lists\nList of active United States military aircraft\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article Sagetech, Arcturus Team to Demonstrate Joint Ops With ADS-B by Brett Davis, October 24, 2012, which exists in the Public Domain.\nThis article contains material that originally came from the web article Arcturus Unmanned Aerial Vehicle by Marine Sgt.

            "content": "Jason Clermont (born May 24, 1978) is a former professional Canadian football slotback who retired after ten seasons in the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the BC Lions and Saskatchewan Roughriders. Clermont started his professional career with the BC Lions after being selected in the 2002 CFL Draft. He played amateur football in his hometown of Regina, starting with the Regina Rams junior football club, and continuing with the team after they became affiliated with the University of Regina. While playing university football, Clermont was named an All-Star and All-Canadian, as well as the Most Valuable Player in the Canada West Conference. As a professional, Clermont's honours have included being named the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie in 2002, Most Outstanding Canadian in 2004 and 2007, as well as the Most Valuable Canadian at the 2004 Grey Cup. Clermont captured a Grey Cup championship with the Lions in 2006. He joined his hometown Roughriders at the start of the 2009 season after being released by the Lions.\n\n\n== Amateur football ==\n\n\n=== High school ===\nClermont started playing football when he was eight years old, after seeing a minor football team practicing behind his home. He played high school football at Robert Usher Collegiate in his hometown of Regina, Saskatchewan. In 1995, Clermont quarterbacked Usher to a city championship.\n\n\n=== Junior ===\nAfter finishing his high school career, Clermont played for the Regina Rams of the Canadian Junior Football League (CJFL). Clermont was named the Prairie Football Conference's Outstanding Rookie Receiver in 1996 and was named to the conference's All-Star team in 1997 and 1998. He was named a CJFL All-Canadian in 1998. The Rams won the Canadian Bowl as the nation's junior football champions in 1997 and 1998. In 1997, Clermont scored the winning touchdown in double overtime. As of 2010, Clermont still holds the CJFL record for most points scored in a game with 18 on October 25, 1997. In that game, he also set the record for most touchdowns in a game, with three, and most receiving touchdowns in a game with two.\n\n\n=== University ===\nAfter the 1998 season, the Rams left the CJFL in favour of affiliation with the University of Regina to play Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) football in the Canada West conference. In 2000, Clermont and the Rams were the runners up in the Vanier Cup championship. During his senior year with the Rams, Clermont was named a Canada West All-Star, and a CIS All-Canadian in addition to being named the Most Outstanding Player in the Canada West conference and the nominee for Hec Creighton Award. He was also selected to participate in the annual East-West Shrine Game at the end of the season. In 2007, Clermont was inducted in the Regina Rams Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== BC Lions ===\nAfter his university career, Clermont was drafted in the first round (fourth overall) of the 2002 CFL Draft by the BC Lions. During the Lions' 2002 season Clermont played slotback and played a key role in the team's offense with 46 receptions for 735 yards and six touchdowns. These numbers were good enough for Clermont to capture the CFL's Most Outstanding Rookie Award. Clermont had similar production in 2003, finishing the season with 615 yards and seven touchdowns.\nClermont had his breakthrough season in 2004, catching 83 passes for 1220 yards and seven touchdowns. He was named the CFL's Top Canadian in addition to securing a spot on the Western Division All-Star Team. Clermont and the Lions made it to the 2004 Grey Cup, but were defeated by the Toronto Argonauts. Despite the loss, Clermont captured the Dick Suderman Trophy as the Outstanding Canadian in the championship game.\nWith the Lions in 2005, Clermont recorded his second 1000-yard season, and caught four touchdown passes. The 2006 season was a disappointing one for Clermont, as he missed significant time after suffering torn knee ligaments in the first game of the season. He finished the season with 44 receptions and three touchdowns, while starting 11 games. Clermont was back in the lineup in time for the playoffs, and saw limited action as the Lions captured the 2006 Grey Cup with a 25\u201314 victory over the Montreal Alouettes.\nIn 2007, Clermont caught 86 passes for 1158 yards and 7 TDs. He won his second CFL Most Outstanding Canadian award and he was named a CFL All-Star.\nClermont had an injury plagued season in 2008, leading head coach Wally Buono to deem him expendable. As such, on December 3, 2008, the Lions released Clermont and he became a free agent. In August 2016 the BC Lions inducted Clermont into their Wall of Fame.\n\n\n=== Saskatchewan Roughriders ===\nClermont signed a contract with the Saskatchewan Roughriders on December 12, 2008, finally being afforded the opportunity to join his hometown team. Although fans expected much from Clermont for the 2009 season, his role on offence was limited as he only caught 23 passes for 317 yards and was a healthy scratch for two games. His first touchdown for the Roughriders was scored on November 14, 2010, at the end of the first semifinal game of the season, taking Saskatchewan to a 41-38 victory against the BC Lions in double overtime. Clermont was named the CFL's Outstanding Canadian for the first week of the playoffs after his performance in the Western semi-final.\nOn April 24, 2012, Clermont retired from the Canadian Football League after a ten-year career that included four Grey Cup appearances and one Grey Cup championship.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJason Clermont on Twitter",

Nadkarni was born in Kodibag and raised in Bankikkodla. At Bankikodla, literature, folk art, spiritual lore, music and sports kept him enthralled during his school days. Mangesh completed his high school diploma (1948\u201349) from the A. H. School, Bankikodla. His teachers in high school gave impetus to his imagination and taught him to perceive the sheer excitement of ideas, leading him to the path of his inner quest. Sundar Nadkarni a Karnataka Sahitya Akademi winner was Mangesh's younger brother.\nNadkarni completed his M.A. in English literature from Rajaram College, Kolhapur, and began his teaching career in Rajkot. Later, he moved to Anand where he was a lecturer of English at Nalini Arvind & T.V. Patel Arts College. During his college career, Nadkarni was a student of professor V.K. Gokak who influenced Nadkarni towards Sri Aurobindo\u2019s philosophy. Mangesh earned his Ph.D. in Phonetics from the UCLA, and was a professor of linguistics at the Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages, Hyderabad. He later taught as a senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore (1985\u201393). During the course of his tenure, he guided Ph.D. candidates and published in theoretical and applied Linguistics journals.\n\n\n== At Pondicherry ==\nNadkarni's interest in Sri Aurobindo and his writings were awakened when as a young man he came across the following utterance of Sri Aurobindo in a journal, \"Heaven we have possessed, but not the earth; but the fullness of the Yoga is to make, in the formula of the veda, 'Heaven and Earth equal and one'\"\nThe influence of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s philosophy on him was gradual and he found it intellectually most liberating and satisfying. He was a Yogi on the path of continuous progress, and a renowned exponent of the Integral Yoga of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. He lectured many times on Sri Aurobindo\u2019s philosophy and vision. Dr. Nadkarni spoke brilliantly on \u2018Savitri\u2019, a 24,000-verse epic poem by Sri Aurobindo. The poem recounts the saga of human victory over ignorance and the conquest of death. Reading \u2018Savitri\u2019 is itself considered a practice of integral yoga and a potent vehicle of aspiration. Nadkarni inculcated \u2018Savitri\u2019 as a mantra in his life.\n\n\n== Selected work ==\nBeyond Liberalism 'Humanism and Technological Trans-humanism.' - a monograph\n'Some thoughts on taking Sri Aurobindo to the youth'. - a monograph\nA Brief Introduction to Savitri - a monograph. - a monograph\nProblems of Human Unity in Sri Aurobindo's Light - a monograph.\nHindu-Muslim Unity in Sri Aurobindo's Light - a monograph.\nA set of sixteen audio-cassettes containing talks given by him on Savitri at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram have been published.\nIndia's Spiritual Destiny - Its Inevitability and Potentiality\n\"Bilingualism and syntactic change in Konkani\" published in - Language, 1975 - (a major journal included in JSTOR) has 86 citations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nA journey on The Sunlit Path - A collection of tributes to Nadkarni (Publisher Mirravision Trust, Pondicheri- 605003, India.), 2008.\n\n\n== References ==",

The \"2007\" in the title references the ten years passed since his third studio album Adrenaline Rush. The first official single from the album was \"Give It Up\", featuring Pharrell and \"Creep Fast (Feat. T-Pain)\" was the second single. The professional review from XXL states that the content of commercial and raw talent is a good mix. The album has received generally favorable reviews.\nThe album debuted at #10 on the U.S. Billboard 200 music chart, selling over 41,000 copies in its 1st week; this was markedly poorer than the first week performance of The Day After, which debuted #2 with about 130,000 copies sold. The album also dropped off the charts quickly, falling to #48 in its second week with over 20,000 copies sold, then falling off the Top 100.\nAs of June 2008, the album has sold well over 365,000 copies.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Other Tracks ==\n\"Blessed\" (featuring Jessi Malay) (Produced by ???)\n\"Well It's Time\" (Produced by Kanye West)\n\"Talk Hard\" (featuring Kanjia, Pitbull, & E-40) (Produced by Core DJ's)\n\"Two Times for My Nigga\" (Produced by ???)\n\"Ass Whoop\" (featuring Saigon) (Produced by Just Blaze)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Give It Up\"\n\"Creep Fast\"\n\"Pimp Like Me\"\n\n\n== External links ==\n'Album/Producer Credits At The Vault, Dubcc.com'\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The 1992 Summer Olympic Games (Spanish: Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de Verano de 1992; Catalan: Jocs Ol\u00edmpics d'estiu de 1992), officially known as the Games of the XXV Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event celebrated in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain in 1992. Beginning in 1994, the International Olympic Committee decided to hold the games in alternating even-numbered years; as a result, the 1992 Summer Olympics were the last competition to be staged in the same year as the Winter Olympics. The games were the first to be unaffected by boycotts since 1972  and the first since the end of the Cold War.\n\n\n== Host city selection ==\nBarcelona is the second-largest city in Spain, and the birthplace of then-IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch. The city was also a host for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. On October 17, 1986, Barcelona was selected to host the 1992 Summer Games over Amsterdam, Belgrade, Birmingham, Brisbane, and Paris, during the 91st IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland. Barcelona had previously bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics, but they ultimately lost to Berlin.\n\n\n== Highlights ==\n\nAt the Opening Ceremony Greek mezzo-soprano Agnes Baltsa sang \"Romiossini\" as the Olympic flag was paraded around the stadium. Alfredo Kraus later sang the Olympic Hymn in both Catalan and Spanish as the flag was hoisted.\nThe Olympic flame cauldron was lit by a flaming arrow, shot by Paralympic archer Antonio Rebollo. The arrow had been lit by the flame of the Olympic Torch. Rebollo overshot the cauldron as this was the original design of the lighting scheme.\nSouth Africa was allowed to compete in the Olympic Games for the first time since the 1960 Summer Olympics, after a long suspension for its apartheid policy. After a close race in the Women's 10,000 metres event, white South African runner Elana Meyer and black Ethiopian runner Derartu Tulu (winner) ran a victory lap together, hand-in-hand.\nFollowing its reunification in 1990, Germany sent a single, unified Olympic team for the first time since the 1964 Summer Olympics.\nAs the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania sent their own teams for the first time since 1936. Other former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. This team consisted of present-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan.\nThe separation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia led to the Olympic debuts of Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Due to United Nations sanctions, athletes from Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were not allowed to participate with their own team. However, some individual athletes competed under the Olympic flag as Independent Olympic Participants.\nIn basketball, the admittance of NBA players led to the formation of the \"Dream Team\" of the United States, featuring Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and other NBA stars. The Dream Team, which easily won the gold medal, would be inducted as a unit into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.\nFerm\u00edn Cacho won the 1,500 metres in his home country, earning Spain's first-ever Olympic gold medal in a running event.\nChinese diver Fu Mingxia, age 13, became the youngest Olympic gold medalist of all time.\nIn men's artistic gymnastics, Vitaly Scherbo from Belarus, (representing the Unified Team), won six gold medals, including four in a single day. Scherbo tied Eric Heiden's record for individual gold medals at a single Olympics, winning five medals in an individual event. (Michael Phelps would later equal this record in 2008).\nIn women's artistic gymnastics, Tatiana Gutsu took gold in the All-Around competition edging the United States' Shannon Miller.\nRussian swimmers dominated the freestyle events, with Alexander Popov and Yevgeny Sadovyi each winning two events. Sadovyi also won in the relays.\nEvelyn Ashford won her fourth Olympic gold medal in the 4\u00d7100-metre relay, making her one of only four female athletes to have achieved this in history.\nThe young Krisztina Egerszegi of Hungary won three individual swimming gold medals.\nIn women's 200 metre breaststroke, Kyoko Iwasaki of Japan won a gold medal at age of 14 years and six days, making her the youngest-ever gold medalist in swimming competitions at the Olympics.\nAlgerian athlete Hassiba Boulmerka, who was frequently criticized by Muslim groups in Algeria who thought she showed too much of her body when racing, received death threats and was forced to move to Europe to train, won the 1,500 metres, also holding the African women's record in this distance.\nAfter demonstrated in six previous Summer Olympic Games, baseball officially became an Olympic sport. Badminton and women's judo also became part of the Olympic program, while slalom canoeing returned to the Games after a 20-year absence.\nRoller hockey, basque pelota, and taekwondo were all demonstrated at the 1992 Summer Olympics.\nSeveral of the U.S. men's volleyball gold medal team from the 1988 Olympics returned to vie for another medal. In the preliminary round, they lost a controversial match to Japan, sparking them to shave their heads in protest. This notably included player Steve Timmons, sacrificing his trademark red flattop for the protest. That didn't prevent the U.S. team from progressing to the playoffs and winning bronze.\nMike Stulce of the United States won the men's shot put, beating the heavily favored Werner G\u00fcnth\u00f6r of Switzerland.\nOn the 20th anniversary of the Munich massacre and the 500th anniversary of the Alhambra Decree, Yael Arad became the first Israeli to win an Olympic medal, winning a silver medal in judo. The next day, Oren Smadja became Israel's first male medalist, winning a bronze in the same sport.\nDerek Redmond of Great Britain tore a hamstring during a 400-meter semi-final heat. As he struggled to finish the race, his father entered the track without credentials and helped him complete the race, to a standing ovation from the crowd.\nGail Devers won the 100-meter dash in one of the closest races in history. Five women finished within 0.06 seconds of each other. In the 100 meter hurdles, Devers was a clear favorite to win, though finished in fifth place when she hit the final hurdle and stumbled over the finish line. Voula Patoulidou from Greece won the event.\nJennifer Capriati won the singles tennis competition at the age of 16. She had previously earned a spot in the semifinals of two grand slams at the age of 14.\nTwo gold medals were awarded in solo synchronized swimming after a judge inadvertently entered the score of \"8.7\" instead of the intended \"9.7\" in the computerized scoring system for one of Sylvie Fr\u00e9chette's figures. This error ultimately placed Fr\u00e9chette second, leaving Kristen Babb-Sprague for the gold medal. Though immediate protests to FINA were unsuccessful, FINA awarded Fr\u00e9chette a gold medal in December 1993, replacing her silver medal and leaving the two swimmers both with gold.\nIndonesia won its first-ever gold medal, after winning a silver medal at 1988 Olympics. Susi Susanti won the gold in badminton women's singles after defeating Bang Soo-hyun in the final round. Alan Budikusuma won the badminton men's singles competition, earning a second gold medal for Indonesia. Several years later, Susanti and Budikusuma married and she received the nickname golden bride or Olympic bride.\n\n\n=== Records ===\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\nMontju\u00efc Area:\nCross-country course \u2013 modern pentathlon (running)\nEstadi Ol\u00edmpic de Montju\u00efc \u2013 opening/closing ceremonies, athletics\nPalau Sant Jordi \u2013 gymnastics (artistics), volleyball (final), and handball (final)\nPiscines Bernat Picornell \u2013 modern pentathlon (swimming), swimming, synchronized swimming, and water polo (final)\nPiscina Municipal de Montju\u00efc \u2013 diving and water polo\nInstitut National d'Educaci\u00f3 F\u00edsica de Catalunya \u2013 wrestling\nMatar\u00f3 \u2013 athletics (marathon start)\nPalau dels Esports de Barcelona \u2013 gymnastics (rhythmic) and volleyball\nPalau de la Metal\u00b7l\u00fargia \u2013 fencing, modern pentathlon (fencing)\nPavell\u00f3 de l'Espanya Industrial \u2013 weightlifting\nWalking course \u2013 athletics (walks)\n\nDiagonal Area:\nCamp Nou \u2013 football (final)\nPalau Blaugrana \u2013 judo, roller hockey (demonstration final), and taekwondo (demonstration)\nEstadi de Sarri\u00e0 \u2013 football\nReal Club de Polo de Barcelona \u2013 equestrian (dressage, jumping, eventing final), modern pentathlon (riding)\n\nVall d'Hebron Area:\nArchery Field \u2013 archery\nPavell\u00f3 de la Vall d'Hebron \u2013 basque pelota (demonstration) and volleyball\nTennis de la Vall d'Hebron \u2013 tennis\nVelodrome \u2013 cycling (track)\n\nParc de Mar Area\nEstaci\u00f3 del Nord Sports Hall \u2013 table tennis\nOlympic Harbour \u2013 sailing\nPavell\u00f3 de la Mar Bella \u2013 badminton\n\nSubsites\nA-17 highway \u2013 cycling (road team time trial)\nBanyoles Lake \u2013 rowing\nCamp Municipal de Beisbol de Viladecans \u2013 baseball\nCanal Ol\u00edmpic de Catalunya \u2013 canoeing (sprint)\nCircuit de Catalunya \u2013 cycling (road team time trial start/ finish)\nClub H\u00edpic El Montay\u00e1 \u2013 equestrian (dressage, eventing endurance)\nEstadi de la Nova Creu Alta \u2013 football\nEstadi Ol\u00edmpic de Terrassa \u2013 field hockey\nEstadio Lu\u00eds Casanova \u2013 football\nLa Romareda \u2013 football\nL'Hospitalet de Llobregat Baseball Stadium \u2013 baseball (final)\nMollet del Vall\u00e8s Shooting Range \u2013 modern pentathlon (shooting), shooting\nPalau D'Esports de Granollers \u2013 handball\nParc Ol\u00edmpic del Segre \u2013 canoeing (slalom)\nPavell\u00f3 Club Joventut Badalona \u2013 boxing\nPavell\u00f3 de l'Ateneu de Sant Sadurn\u00ed \u2013 roller hockey (demonstration)\nPavell\u00f3 del Club Pat\u00ed Vic \u2013 roller hockey (demonstration)\nPavell\u00f3 d'Esports de Reus \u2013 roller hockey (demonstration)\nPavell\u00f3 Ol\u00edmpic de Badalona \u2013 basketball\nSant Sadurn\u00ed Cycling Circuit \u2013 cycling (individual road race)\n\nSome events, including diving, took place in view of construction of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia\n\n\n== Medals awarded ==\n\nThe 1992 Summer Olympic programme featured 257 events in the following 25 sports:\n\n\n=== Demonstration sports ===\n Basque pelota (10)\n Roller hockey (quad) (1)\n Taekwondo (16)\n\n\n== Calendar ==\nAll times are in Central European Summer Time (UTC+2)\n\n\n== Participating National Olympic Committees ==\n\nA total of 169 nations sent athletes to compete in the 1992 Summer Games.\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union, twelve of the fifteen new states formed a Unified Team, while the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania each had their own teams for the first time since 1936. For the first time, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina competed as independent nations after their separation from Socialist Yugoslavia, and Namibia and the unified team of Yemen (previously North and South Yemen) also made their Olympic debuts.\nThe 1992 Summer Olympics notably marked Germany competing as a unified team for the first time since 1964, while South Africa returned to the Games for the first time in 32 years.\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was banned due to UN sanctions, but individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as Independent Olympic Participants. Four National Olympic Committees did not send any athletes to compete: Afghanistan, Brunei, Liberia and Somalia.\n Brunei participated in the Opening Ceremony, but its delegation consisted of only one official. This also occurred in the 1988 Games\n Afghanistan didn't send their athletes to compete, but the country took part in the Parade of Nations.\n Liberia and  Somalia also participated in the Opening Ceremony, but its accredited athletes (five and two, respectively) did not enter to compete.\n\n\n== Medal count ==\n\nThe following table reflects the top ten nations in terms of total medals won at the 1992 Games (the host nation is highlighted).\n\n\n== Broadcast rights ==\nThe 1992 Summer Olympics were covered in many countries by the following television and radio broadcasters:\n\n\n== Effect on the city ==\n\nThe celebration of the 1992 Olympic Games had an enormous impact on the urban culture and external projection of Barcelona. The Games provided billions of dollars for infrastructure investments, which are considered to have improved the quality of life and attraction of the city for investment and tourism. Barcelona became one of the most visited cities in Europe after Paris, London, and Rome.\nBarcelona's nomination for the 1992 Summer Games sparked the application of a previously elaborated ambitious urban plan. Barcelona opened to the sea with the construction of the Olympic Village and Olympic Port in Poblenou. New centres were created, and modern sports facilities were built in the Olympic zones of Montju\u00efc, Diagonal, and Vall d'Hebron. Hotels were also either built or refurbished. The construction of ring roads around the city helped reduce the density of the traffic, and El Prat airport was modernized and expanded as two new terminals were opened.\n\n\n=== Cost and cost overrun ===\nThe Oxford Olympics Study estimates the outturn cost of the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics at USD 9.7 billion in 2015-dollars and cost overrun at 266% in real terms. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) operational costs incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost and cost overrun for Barcelona 1992 compares with costs of USD 4.6 billion and a cost overrun of 51% for Rio 2016 and USD 15 billion and 76% for London 2012. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is USD 5.2 billion, average cost overrun is 176%.\n\n\n== Songs and themes ==\nThere were two main musical themes for the 1992 Games. The first one was \"Barcelona\", a classical crossover song composed five years earlier by Freddie Mercury and Mike Moran; Mercury was an admirer of lyric soprano Montserrat Caball\u00e9, both recorded the official theme as a duet. Due to Mercury's death eight months earlier, the duo was unable to perform the song together during the opening ceremony. A recording of the song instead played over a travelogue of the city at the start of the opening ceremony, seconds before the official countdown. \"Amigos Para Siempre\" (Friends for Life) was the other musical theme. It was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Don Black, and sung by Sarah Brightman and Jos\u00e9 Carreras during the closing ceremonies.\nRyuichi Sakamoto composed and conducted the opening ceremony musical score. The Opening Olympic fanfare was composed by Angelo Badalamenti and with orchestrations by Joseph Turrin.\n\n\n== Mascot ==\n\nThe official mascot was Cobi, a Catalan sheepdog in cubist style designed by Javier Mariscal.\n\n\n== Corporate image and identity ==\nA renewal in Barcelona's image and corporate identity could be seen in the publication of posters, commemorative coins, stamps minted by the FNMT in Madrid, and the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Official Commemorative Medals, designed and struck in Barcelona.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n1992 Summer Paralympics\n1992 Winter Olympics\n1992 Winter Paralympics\nList of IOC country codes\nOlympics Triplecast\nUse of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games \u2014 1992 Barcelona\nBarcelona Gold\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Barcelona 1992\".

The film was screened in the main competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, where it was poorly received by critics.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRudolf Frecska as boy\nKitty Cs\u00edkos as girl\nKorn\u00e9l Mundrucz\u00f3 as director\nLili Monori as mother\nMikl\u00f3s Sz\u00e9kely B. as father\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was produced by Proton Cinema with co-production support from fellow Hungarian companies Filmpartners and Laokoon Film, Germany's Essential Filmproduktion and Austria's KGP Produktion. It received 150 million HUF (\u20ac540,000) in support from the Motion Picture Public Foundation of Hungary and 145,000 Euro from the Mitteldeutsche Medienf\u00f6rderung in Germany. The total budget was \u20ac1.6 million.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPeter Brunette of The Hollywood Reporter was highly critical of the film: \"One wonders what the grand poobahs at the Cannes Film Festival were thinking when they chose \"Tender Son -- The Frankenstein Project,\" a disastrously bad Hungarian film, for the competition. It's pokey and pretentious, and all character motivations, which are often contradictory if not ridiculously illogical, seem based on the film's symbolic needs rather than on real-life psychological desires.\" In Variety, Boyd van Hoeij was disappointed with how the filmmakers had bypassed the original novel's mythological allusions: \"Mundruczo and regular co-scripter Yvette Biro (Delta, Johanna) have completely neutered Shelley's clever notion of a hero [sic] incompatible with his surroundings by replacing the monster with a flesh-and-blood human with no backstory, turning him into a supposed equal rather than a misunderstood outcast. Without a clear understanding of his psychology or past (How was he treated in the orphanage? How does he feel about his parents' absence for most of his life?), his random killing spree seems simply incomprehensible and vile.\" In 2010, film won Special Jury Prize at Sarajevo Film Festival.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTender Son: The Frankenstein Project on IMDb",

            "content": "Adivi Sesh, born Adivi Sesh Sunny Chandra, is an Indian film actor-director who works predominantly in Telugu cinema and a few Tamil films. He made his film debut as a lead actor and director in 2010 with Karma: Do You Believe?. His notable performances and commercial successes include Baahubali: The Beginning (2015), Dongaata (2015), Kshanam (2016), and Ami Thumi (2017). His film Kshanam was a super hit and it went on to get nominated for numerous awards. He is the cousin of Tollywood director Sai Kiran Adivi.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe debuted as an actor in movie sontham(2002) a small guest appearance, director and writer in the 2010 film Karma: Do You Believe? which also starred Jade Tailor and Sher Ali in the lead roles. Sesh's portrayal of Dev, a person who can fore-see events mere seconds before they happen, was well appreciated. Rediff praised his performance stating \"As far as acting goes, Sesh Adivi does a good job. With an 'angelic' face he is an apt choice to play enigmatic Dev. His scripting skills also deserve mention. He may have chosen an unconventional path and a novel theme but he has tried to infuse something new in Telugu cinema.\"\nIn 2011, Sesh appeared in Vishnuvardhan's Panjaa which starred Pawan Kalyan, Sarah Jane Dias and Anjali Lavania in the lead. In this film, Sesh portrayed the role of Munna, an NRI who is a wealthy spoiled brat and a very dangerous person to those around him. This also marked his debut as a villain. His performance was highly appreciated by critics. Rediff said of his performance, \"Sesh Adivi is worth watching for his 'maniacal' performance which is just the opposite of what he did in Karma, his directorial and acting debut.\" CineGoer.com also praised his performance, saying \"Sesh's Karma changes for the good with this film and he is quite a revelation.\" He has also appeared in S.S. Rajamouli's epic drama Baahubali.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAdivi Sesh on IMDb\nAdivi Sesh on Facebook",

            "content": "The Gresham Palace (Gresham-palota) is a building in Budapest, Hungary; it is an example of Art Nouveau architecture. Completed in 1906 as an office and apartment building, it is today the Four Seasons Hotel Budapest Gresham Palace, a luxury hotel managed by Four Seasons Hotels. It is located along the River Danube, adjacent to Sz\u00e9chenyi Square and the eastern terminus of the Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site was once occupied by N\u00e1k\u00f3 House, a neo-classical palace built in 1827. In 1880, the London-based Gresham Life Assurance Company bought the property, at a time when it was illegal to invest money in stocks, but rental income was a wise investment. The company later decided to build its foreign headquarters on the site, and decided that they needed a grander setting for them. They commissioned local architects Zsigmond Quittner and Jozsef Vago to design the new structure, and in 1904, they began construction of the Gresham Palace, which was completed in 1906 and opened in 1907. It was named after the 16th-century English financier Sir Thomas Gresham, the founder of the Royal Exchange in London.\nOriginally, the palace served as an office building as well as a residence for senior staff of the Gresham company. During the occupation after World War II, the Red Army used the building as a barracks. Eventually, it became decrepit and was used as an apartment building during the People's Republic of Hungary. In 1990, following the end of the communist regime, the national government presented the palace to the city of Budapest.\nOberoi Hotels entered into an agreement to manage a hotel in the building in 1991, but ensuing legal battles with residents of the building caused Oberoi to drop out in 1995. In 1998, Gresco Investments Ltd acquired the building and received approval from the Budapest Heritage Board to reconstruct it as a luxury hotel while retaining its original Art Nouveau architecture. Gresco raised $85 million for renovations and in 1999 Four Seasons agreed to oversee the reconstruction and manage the new property.\nIn 2001, the building was bought by the Irish investment company Quinland Private. They extensively rebuilt the structure as a luxury hotel, restoring such original details as a large staircase, stained glass, mosaics, ironwork, and winter gardens. The hotel reopened in June 2004. In November 2011, the hotel was bought by the State General Reserve Fund of Oman, though Four Seasons continues to manage it. It currently has 179 guest rooms, including 17 suites.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHistory of the Gresham Palace\nGresham Palace at funiq.hu",

            "content": "Robert Lindsay Mason (April 1942 \u2013 25 August 2006), known as Lindsay Mason, was a unionist politician in Northern Ireland. Known as something of an eccentric, Mason's entire career in politics was spent outside the major unionist parties such as the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in Larne, Mason was the son of a local paper mill manager. He studied at the Royal School Dungannon and Vernon College before becoming an antiques dealer.\nMason became involved in Ulster loyalism, running a weekly stall in Belfast City Centre which sold newspapers published by the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force, alongside his own publication, the Ulster Constitution. In 1971, he founded the far right Ulster Constitution Party with David Riddelsdell, a group described by David Kerr as \"ultra-loyalist\".\n\n\n== Belfast City Council ==\nIn 1972, he was elected to Belfast City Council in a by-election, representing the predominantly Catholic Lower Falls, although this victory was only achieved because all the Irish nationalist and republican parties refused to nominate candidates, in protest at the introduction of internment. Mason had been elected unopposed as no other unionist candidates had stood although he did not campaign on the Falls for safety reasons, stating \"I am sure there are a few trigger happy republicans in there and I don't want to take the risk of being a handy target for one of them\". According to Malachi O'Doherty Mason had to ask permission from his mother, with whom he lived, to go on to the Falls when, following the election, O'Doherty suggested they have a photoshoot for the new councillor on the road.\nDue to his eccentricities and the fact that he wasn't tied to any major party, Mason received wide coverage in the local press whilst a member of the council. He held regular loyalist protest meetings inside Belfast City Hall and at one of these a group of female supporters attacked Social Democratic and Labour Party member Paddy Wilson, attempting to tear off his clothing following an ambush from which Wilson was forced to flee. While a sitting councillor, his firearm licence was withdrawn by the police, and he instead purchased a bow and arrow, with which he patrolled his local streets.\n\n\n== Off the council ==\nFollowing a review of local government in Northern Ireland, Belfast's council wards were redrawn in 1973, and Mason lost his seat in the ensuing election. One month later, he stood for East Belfast at the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election, but was not elected.\nIn 1974, Mason joined the British National Front, merging the Constitution Party into it. He stood for Ards Borough Council at the Northern Ireland local elections, 1977, describing himself as an \"independent Protestant loyalist\", but was not successful. Following this defeat, he relocated to Penarth in Wales, where he ran the antiques shop \"Beautiful Things\".\n\n\n== Larne ==\nMason returned to Northern Ireland in the mid-1980s, suffering a major heart attack on the journey over, but he established a new antiques shop in Larne, and became a well-known character in the town, wearing colourful tracksuits and baseball caps, and driving a pink Cadillac El Dorado. In 1993, he stood for Larne Borough Council as an independent anti-corruption candidate, and was elected.He announced his intent to stand for election by declaring \"I'm going to drag the council into the 1990s,but I'll do it gradually and get them into the 1790s first\". He pursued various environmental campaigns, and held his seat in 1997, 2001 and 2005, claiming that he was not a good councillor, but was re-elected as the other candidates were worse. He was known for his flamboyant style of dress whilst attending council meetings in Larne, typically wearing tracksuit bottoms, Nike Air Max trainers and a multi-coloured jersey in a chamber where suits were standard attire. His style of canvassing was regarded as unorthodox as he carried a loudspeaker into Larne centre and engaged with passing shoppers. In 1997 he issued a call for members of the public to be allowed to view council meetings. When the new council building in Larne was officially opened by a member of the Royal Family, Mason held a protest outside the building complaining of the cost to build it. He frequently engaged in heated arguments with other councillors, and was removed by police from the council chamber on several occasions. On one such occasion in 2002 Mason had his removal from the council chambers examined by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Mason had been removed following a fiery arguemnt with mayor Bobby McKee. He was also noted for a campaign against the financial interests of Roy Beggs, which resulted in Beggs being investigated by Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Elizabeth Filkin regarding undeclared business interests. As a result of the investigation, Beggs was forced to pay back over \u00a32000 in expenses.\nHe was less successful in national elections, failing to win a seat in East Antrim at the 1997 and 2001 general elections, and in the Assembly constituency in 1998 and 2003. In 1998 he ran as an independent pro-Belfast Agreement candidate, with his campaign largely focussing on what he saw as the lack of commitment to the deal from the Ulster Unionist Party.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMason died as a result of heart failure. In the months leading up to his death he was in steadily decreasing health. He suffered from asthma and breathing problems.Fellow councillor and friend Danny O'Connor had mentioned family bereavements including his mother and aunt had taken a toll on Mason's health. He was buried in Clandeboye cemetery in Bangor.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOutside politics, Mason was known for having Asperger syndrome, his close attachment to his pet dog Honey, his love of rave music \u2013 he spent his 54th birthday at an all-night rave \u2013 and for regularly calling into radio discussion programmes. On one occasion, he was selected as a reserve for the television quiz Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, although he did not appear on the show.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nO'Doherty, Malachi (2007).

Enigmail works under Microsoft Windows, Unix-like, and Mac OS X operating systems. Its cryptographic functionality is handled by GNU Privacy Guard.\nIn their default configuration, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey provide e-mail encryption and signing using S/MIME, which relies on X.509 keys provided by a centralised certificate authority. Enigmail adds an alternative mechanism where cooperating users can instead use keys provided by a web of trust, which relies on multiple users to endorse the authenticity of the sender's and recipient's credentials. In principle this enhances security, since it does not rely on a centralised entity which might be compromised by security failures or engage in malpractice due to commercial interests or pressure from the jurisdiction in which it resides.\nEnigmail was first released in 2001 by Ramalingam Saravanan, and since 2003 maintained by Patrick Brunschwig. Both Enigmail and GNU Privacy Guard are free, open-source software. Enigmail with Thunderbird is now the most popular PGP setup.\nEnigmail has announced its support for the new \"pretty Easy privacy\" (p\u2261p) encryption scheme in a joint Thunderbird extension to be released in December 2015. As of June 2016 the FAQ note it will be available in Q3 2016.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGNU Privacy Guard\nOpenPGP\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nEncryption Works: How to Protect Your Privacy in the Age of NSA Surveillance",

The club are currently members of the United Counties League Premier Division and play at Victoria Mill, London Road. They are managed by former player James Mallows\n\n\n== History ==\nThe club was established in 1973 after london Ideal Clothiers folded. At the time most Clothiers players were also playing for the Sunday league team Victoria Millers, and after discussing the idea with Dave Woodley, Whitworths FC was established. The new club started in Division One of the Rushden and District League. After winning the Division in 1975\u201376 and 1976\u201377, they moved up to the East Midlands Alliance. The club won the league's Munton Cup twice. On the second occasion both the first team and the reserve teams reached the final, with the reserve team winning 6\u20131. The following season reserve teams were banned from entering the cup.\nAfter making several improvements to their ground, the club moved up to Division One of the United Counties League in 1985. Since then the club have remained in Division One, twice finishing as runners-up, and winning the division without losing a match in 2006\u201307.\nIn the summer of 2013, managers Steve Sargent and Matty Freeman were sacked and replaced by former Flourmen striker James Daldy and his assistant and former professional Tommy Jaszczun.\nIn the summer of 2013, Whitworth experienced a large turnover of players and eventually finished 17th in Division One in Daldy's first season. During the 2013-14 season Whitworth recorded their record high win, defeating Woodford United 16-0 on 17 March 2014.\nThe Flourmen finished a respectable 7th in the 2014-15 season after threatening promotion for a number of early months.\nIn January 2014, Whitworth signed 46-year-old former England defender Neil Ruddock. [1] Daldy departed early into the 2015-16 season and was replaced by his assistant, Tommy Jaszczun for the remainder of the season.\nIn 2016 James Mallows was appointed manager replacing Jaszczun and The Flourmen were promoted from the United Counties League Division One in the 2016-17 season in Mallows' debut season.\nThe club competed in the United Counties League Premier Division in the 2017-18 season for the first time in their existence and in their first ever game beat Peterborough Northern Star F.C. 5-0 away from home.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nUnited Counties League\nDivision One Champions 2006\u201307\nDivision One Runners-Up 2016-17\n\nEast Midlands Alliance\nMunton Cup winners twice\n\nRushden & District League\nDivision One Champions 1975\u201376, 1976\u201377\n\n\n== Records ==\nRecord attendance: 1,150 vs Wellingborough Town, United Counties League Division One, 24 December 2005\nRecord win: 16-0 vs Woodford United, United Counties League Division One, 17 March 2014 News Report\n\n\n== Players ==\n\n\n=== Current squad ===\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

            "content": "Robert de Mowbray (died 1125), a Norman, was Earl of Northumbria from 1086, until 1095, when he was deposed for rebelling against William Rufus, King of England. He was the son of Roger de Mowbray and nephew of Geoffrey de Montbray, bishop of Coutances. The family name derives from Montbrai in Manche, Normandy, Mowbray being an Anglicisation of it.\n\n\n== Earldom of Northumbria ==\nRobert was made Earl of Northumbria after Aubrey de Coucy, the previous earl decided that he no longer wished to remain in his post. Coucy was made earl in 1080 and, probably that same year, resigned his position and returned to Normandy losing all of the lands that he held in England. He was not replaced until Robert was appointed in 1086.\nIn 1088 Robert and his uncle, Geoffrey, sided with Robert, duke of Normandy, in the rebellion against William Rufus, and both were active militarily. The rebellion failed but the king subsequently pardoned them both, and Robert remained in his post as Earl of Northumbria.\nIn November 1093 Malcolm III of Scotland invaded Northumbria for the second time since 1091, and attacked Alnwick. Robert de Mowbray raised an army and attacked the Scots taking them by surprise on 13 November (St Brice\u2019s Day). In the ensuing conflict, known as the Battle of Alnwick, Malcolm and his son Edward were slain. Earlier that same year Geoffrey de Montbray died and Mowbray succeeded to his uncle's large estates, so becoming one of the most powerful barons in the kingdom.\nIn 1095 Mowbray married Matilda, daughter of Richard de l'Aigle, and niece of Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester.\n\n\n== Rebellion and downfall ==\nIn 1095 Mowbray took part in a rebellion which had for its object the transference of the crown from the sons of the Conqueror to Stephen of Aumale. It appears that there was a conspiracy that included several barons, but that when the time came for action most of the conspirators abandoned the scheme leaving Mowbray and his fellow conspirator William of Eu exposed. The incident that brought the matter to a head was Mowbray seizing four Norwegian vessels lying in the Tyne. The merchants who owned the vessels complained to the king and Mowbray was commanded to attend the Curia Regis to explain his actions. Mowbray did not attend and ignored further summonses, so that William finally led an army against him. Mowbray shut himself up in his stronghold, Bamburgh Castle. William laid siege to Bamburgh and built a temporary siege castle alongside it, known as Malvoisin, or \"evil neighbour\". For some reason, during the siege, Mowbray left the castle with a small force of knights and was pursued by his besiegers, being forced to take refuge in Tynemouth. After a siege of six days he was wounded in the leg, captured and was taken back to Bamburgh where his wife was still resisting the besiegers. She finally surrendered the castle after the besiegers threatened to blind her husband.\n\n\n== Imprisonment and death ==\nAs a result of his part in the rebellion Mowbray forfeited his estates and was imprisoned for life, initially at Windsor Castle. He spent many years in prisons, \"growing old without offspring\", according to the chronicler, Florence of Worcester, and then was allowed to become a monk at St Albans Abbey, according to another chronicler Orderic Vitalis. There is some doubt about the date of his death. On one hand it was claimed that he spent thirty years in prison, giving his date of death about 1125. However, William Dugdale claimed that Mowbray became a monk and died in 1106.\nMowbray\u2019s fellow conspirators, William of Eu and William of Aldrie, received harsher punishment, William of Eu being castrated and blinded, and William of Aldrie being condemned to death.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nOrderic Vitalis gives the following description of Robert de Mowbray: \"Powerful, rich, bold, fierce in war, haughty, he despised his equals and, swollen with vanity, disdained to obey his superiors. He was of great stature, strong, swarthy and hairy. Daring and crafty, stern and grim, he was given more to meditation than speech, and in conversation scarce ever smiled\".\nMowbray's wife, Matilda, was granted an annulment of her marriage by Pope Paschal II and sometime after 1107, she became the wife of Robert's brother Nigel d'Aubigny, who was also granted the lands in Montbray forfeited by her former husband. The couple remained childless and in 1118 d\u2019Aubigny divorced Matilda and married Gundred de Gournay, daughter of Gerard de Gournay and Edith de Warenne. They had a son, Roger, who inherited the estates originally forfeited by Robert Mowbray. On receiving his inheritance Roger changed his name to Mowbray at the instruction of Henry I. Thus the name Mowbray was continued, but with no blood line from Robert de Mowbray.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nEdward Augustus Freeman, William Rufus, especially Appendices C. C. F. F.

            "content": "WSM (branded The Legend) is a 50,000-watt AM radio station located in Nashville, Tennessee. It broadcasts a full-time country music format at 650 kHz and is known primarily as the home of The Grand Ole Opry, the world's longest running radio program. The station's clear channel signal can reach much of North America and nearby countries, especially late at night. It is one of two clear-channel stations in North America, along with CFZM/740-Toronto, that still primarily broadcast music. Nicknamed \"The Air Castle of the South,\" it shares its callsign with WSM-FM, also in Nashville, and formerly with television Channel 4, now WSMV.\n\n\n== Heritage ==\n\nFounded by the National Life and Accident Insurance Company, WSM first signed on in 1925. It is primarily associated with the popularization of country music through its weekly Saturday night program, the Grand Ole Opry, the longest-running radio program in history. The Opry began as the WSM Barn Dance in 1925, but on December 10, 1927, the program's host, \"Judge\" George D. Hay, referred to the programming as being \"Grand Ole Opry\" in contrast to the preceding grand opera program on NBC. In 1932, WSM boosted its power to 50,000 watts, becoming Tennessee's first clear-channel station. In addition to its vast nighttime coverage area, the station boasts one of the largest daytime coverage areas in the country. It provides at least grade B coverage as far southeast as Chattanooga, as far northwest as Evansville, Indiana, as far west as Jackson, Tennessee and as far south as Huntsville, Alabama. Under the right conditions (particularly at night), it can be heard in nearly all of Tennessee and much of Kentucky, and can be picked up as far away as northern Illinois.\nThe station traditionally played country music in the nighttime hours, when listeners from around the United States would tune in. Before the advent of television, the station broadcast long-form radio (both local and NBC network) programs in addition to music. After television became popular (thus largely eliminating the audience for full-length radio programs), WSM adopted a \"MOR\" (middle of the road) music format during the daytime hours, and continued to play country music at night. It was not until about 1979 that WSM adopted the 24-hour country music format of today.\nWSM is credited with helping shape Nashville into a recording industry capital. Because of WSM's wide reach, musical acts from all across the eastern United States came come to Nashville in the early decades of the station's existence, in hopes of getting to perform on WSM. Over time, as more acts and recording companies came to Nashville, the city became known as the center of the country music industry. Disc jockey David Cobb is credited with first referring to Nashville as \"Music City USA\", a designation that has since been adopted as the city's official nickname by the local tourism board.\nIn 1996, the station was named Radio Station of the Year at the International Bluegrass Music Awards.\n\n\n== Tower ==\nWSM's unusual diamond-shaped antenna (manufactured by Blaw-Knox) is visible from Interstate 65 just south of Nashville (in Brentwood) and is one of the area's landmarks. It is located near the I-65 exit 71 interchange with Concord Road (State Highway 253). When the 878-foot tower was built in 1932, it was the tallest antenna in North America. Its height was reduced to 808 feet (246 m) in 1939 when it was discovered that the taller tower was causing self-cancellation in the \"fringe\" areas of reception of the station (it is now known that 195 electrical degrees, about 810 feet, is the optimum height for a Class A station on that frequency). For a period during World War II it was designated to provide transmissions to submarines in the event that ship-to-shore communications were lost. It is now one of the oldest operating broadcast towers in the United States.\nAs a tribute to the station's centrality in country music history, the diamond antenna design was incorporated into the new Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum's design in 2001. The tower is listed as a National Engineering Landmark and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 2011.\n\n\n== Former FM sister ==\nW47NV/44.7 Megacycles (the historic term now called \"megahertz\") was America's first commercial FM broadcast station. Its antenna is still mounted to the top of the Blaw Knox tower at Brentwood. After World War II W47NV became the first WSM-FM and moved frequencies to 103.3 Mc., and eventually signed off. Other stations on the east coast had signed on with FM, and Major Armstrong's \"Yankee Network\", but W47NV was the first commercial FM, the rest were non-commercial licenses. The current incarnation of WSM-FM was bought by National Life, and redesignated WSM-FM in 1968, an acquisition from another broadcaster. WSM-FM (95.5 MHz) was WSM's sister until 2008, when Cumulus Media, the full owner of WSM-FM since 2003, ended its joint sales agreement with the AM (see below). Despite base callsigns, the two stations are no longer related; incidentally, however, both the 95.5 frequency of the most recent WSM-FM and the 103.3 frequency of the original (now WKDF) are now sister stations, with both broadcasting variants of the Nash FM format.\n\n\n== Ownership and facilities ==\nFor most of its history, WSM was owned by the Nashville-based National Life and Accident Insurance Company, along with WSM-TV, and the Grand Ole Opry. The stations' call letters derived from the company's motto, \"We Shield Millions\". Studios were first located in the NL&AI building on Seventh Avenue and Union Street in downtown Nashville; this was the original home of the Opry, until 1934. The studios remained until the mid-1960s, when NL&AI began carrying out plans to build a new headquarters building downtown and construct new studios for WSM-TV in west Nashville (the TV station had been located near Belmont College). Upon construction of the new headquarters, NL&AI chose to relocate WSM radio to the TV station's building, and the station, joined in 1968 by its new FM sister, broadcast from that location, on Knob Road, from 1966 to 1983. In 1974, NL&AI reorganized itself as a holding company, NLT Corporation, with the WSM stations as one of the major subsidiaries.\nIn 1981, the American General Corporation (now part of the American International Group) bought NLT. American General was not interested in NLT's non-insurance operations, and sold Opryland Hotel, Opryland USA, The Grand Ole Opry, WSM-FM, and WSM, to Gaylord Entertainment Company. WSM-TV was sold to Gillett Broadcasting and is now WSMV. However, there was still considerable overlap between the stations' on-air personnel for some years after the ownership change. Gaylord would add The Nashville Network, now Spike TV, to those holdings soon after those acquisitions, disposing of the television property, in part to pay the expenses of starting the nascent cable network. It would also move the WSM radio stations to new facilities at the Opryland Hotel, departing their shared building on Knob Road, which still houses WSMV today.\nWSM broadcast in the C-QUAM format of AM stereo, which could be heard over several states at night, from 1982 until 2000.\nWSM currently operates out of the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center, and visitors to the hotel may look into the studio 24 hours a day, provided the curtains are open, which they usually are. Following the devastating 2010 Tennessee flood that inundated Gaylord Opryland and the Grand Ole Opry House, the station broadcast from a makeshift studio at its transmitter site for six months, while the Grand Ole Opry rotated between several performance sites, until the buildings at the Opryland complex were repaired. WSM's administrative offices next door to the Grand Ole Opry House were completely destroyed by the flood and later demolished, resulting in the loss of several priceless documents from the station's history.\nIn 2001, management had sought to capitalize on the success of sister station WWTN's sports trappings by converting WSM to an all-sports format. Word was leaked to other media resulting in protests, including longtime Opry personalities and country music singers, outside the station's studios. Management eventually made the decision to keep the station's classic country format.\n\nIn recent years, the operations have been reorganized again. In 2003, WSM-FM and WWTN, sister stations to 650 WSM, were sold to Cumulus Media. Cumulus intended to purchase 650 WSM as well, but Gaylord decided to maintain ownership at the eleventh hour. Through a five-year joint sales agreement, however, Gaylord paid Cumulus a fee to operate WSM's sales department and provide news updates for the station. Gaylord Entertainment continued to control WSM and operate all other departments, including programming, engineering, and promotions. The agreement ended in 2008, at which point all control of the station reverted to Gaylord. In 2012, Gaylord Entertainment Company was renamed Ryman Hospitality Properties.\n\n\n== Reception outside the Nashville area ==\nFrom 2002 until 2006, the station was a choice on Sirius Satellite Radio, which carried a full-time simulcast of WSM's AM 650 signal, except during NASCAR races. Briefly in 2006, the channel converted to \"WSM Entertainment\", a separate satellite radio feed that carried the same classic country music format as the AM signal. About a year after the channel was eliminated, then-rival XM Satellite Radio announced the carriage of the Grand Ole Opry on Nashville! channel 11 beginning in October 2007, as well as the Eddie Stubbs Show on America channel 10 beginning in November 2007. After the merger between Sirius and XM, the Grand Ole Opry broadcasts were moved to the service's The Roadhouse channel, which is heard on both Sirius and XM.\nWSM continues to reach a worldwide audience, through both its powerful 50,000-watt clear channel AM signal and via its Internet simulcast. WSM is a Primary Entry Point (PEP) for the Emergency Alert System (EAS).\n\n\n== Miscellany ==\nCountry and bluegrass legend John Hartford parodied the distinctive style of WSM DJs on the album Aereo-Plain, humorously changing the station's call letters to the phrase \"Dorothy S. Ma'am.\"\n\n\n== Famous station alumni ==\nRalph Emery served as the overnight host of WSM from the late 1950s until the early 1970s. Because of his time slot, listeners all over the U.S. could hear Emery spin country music records. This and The Grand Ole Opry solidified WSM's central role in the history of country music. In the 1980s, Emery gained further national fame as the host of Nashville Now! on The Nashville Network; before then, he hosted syndicated radio and television country music interview shows, and a long-running, highly rated morning show on WSMV-TV.\nPat Sajak (host of TV's Wheel of Fortune) served as the afternoon air personality on WSM during the mid-1970s. During that time, he doubled as a voice-over announcer and weekend weathercaster on WSM-TV, channel 4.\nLarry Munson was a sportscaster for the Nashville Vols, Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball and Vanderbilt Commodores football in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as working for WSM-TV. He was later renowned for his long tenure as the legendary voice of Georgia Bulldogs football.\nGrant Turner (born Jesse Granderson Turner) was known as the \"dean of the Opry announcers\" and had a nearly 50-year association with the station, also announcing country music programs in the early morning hours. His show was so popular that NL&AI used its title, Opryland USA, as the name for the theme park built in 1972.\nTeddy Bart, another Nashville broadcaster of long tenure, began as a singer on shows like Waking Crew and parlayed his skills into hosting that show, an afternoon drive-time program with Munson (above) in the early 1960s and Nashville's first-ever call-in talk show, which ran from 1969 to 1981. He also hosted WSM-TV's Noon Show in the 1970s and anchored WKRN-TV's newscast briefly in the early 1980s before launching the group-discussion radio talk show Roundtable on WLAC in 1985, a show that ran for 20 years on several different stations.\nKeith Bilbrey moved to Nashville in 1974 to begin working for WSM, first as a substitute announcer for WSM-FM and then as a full-time disc jockey on WSM\u2019s FM and AM stations. Throughout his career, Bilbrey worked every single time slot at WSM and became an iconic voice in the modern history of the station and was truly a fan favorite. In 1982, Bilbrey began announcing on The Grand Ole Opry. When The Nashville Network (TNN) began televising a 30-minute portion of the show in 1985, the young announcer became the first host of Grand Ole Opry Live. Bilbrey hosted Opry Live, along with the Opry warm-up show, Backstage Live, until TNN stopped airing the show in 2000. He also hosted the Opry warm-up show on WSM. His 35-year career at the station ended in 2009.\nLarry Gatlin, lead singer of the Gatlin Brothers, hosts an hourlong gospel program on the weekends as of 2016.\nTracy Lawrence's syndicated program Honky Tonkin\u2019 has been flagshipped at WSM since 2015.\nDailey & Vincent host a monthly radio show on the station.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Nashville media\nGrand Ole Opry\nList of radio stations in Tennessee\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nQuery the FCC's AM station database for WSM\nRadio-Locator Information on WSM\nQuery Nielsen Audio's AM station database for WSM\nFCC History Cards for WSM",

            "content": "Water privatization in Guayaquil began with the decision taken in 1995 to privatize drinking water supply and sewerage in Guayaquil, the largest city and economic capital of Ecuador, through a concession contract. In preparation for privatization, the previously separate water and sewer utilities were merged into a single utility in 1996. The new utility began a modernization process and began to improve its performance. In parallel, the international bidding for the concession was prepared by Banque Paribas as the international advisor and was supported by the Inter-American Development Bank. The latter made a loan that was signed in October 1997 conditional upon the decision to award a concession. The 30-year concession agreement between the city government and the private company Interagua was signed in 2001. The contract was \"poor-friendly\", requiring the private company to keep tariffs constant for the first five years and to connect new users in poor areas \"at no cost\". At the same time, the former municipal water and sewer utility ECAPAG became the regulatory agency for the new private utility. Interagua is a consortium led by the Spanish company Proactiva Medio Ambiente, which in turn is supported by the Spanish construction firm FCC and the French water company Veolia Environnement. In 2012 the regulator ECAPAG was transformed into the Municipal Public Drinking Water and Sanitation Company of Guayaquil in what may be a first step towards the municipalization of the concession.\n\n\n== Financing and investments ==\nThe investments undertaken by the concessionaire are financed through retained earnings, the municipality and the State Bank of Ecuador. The government funds are deposited into a trust fund that the concessionnaire can only access under certain conditions. For the 2011-2016 period investments of US$ 380 million are expected to be financed by the concessionnaire (US$ 107.5 million), the municipality and the State Bank of Ecuador (US$ 150 million) as well as the national government and the proceedings of a tax called Special Improvement Contributions (Contribucion Especial de Mejoriamiento, CEM).\n\n\n== Impact ==\nBefore the concession, 50% of the city had only 10 hours service per day. In parts of the city water was supplied only 2 to 4 hours per day, often at low pressure. Commercial and physical losses in water distribution, technically called non-revenue water, stood at a staggering 79 percent. Only 46 percent of water bills were actually collected. And only 26 percent of all connections were metered.\nDuring its first five years the company brought 24 hours service to all the city and served an additional 55,000 families, mostly low income in the southern part of the city. Access to water supply increased from 64 percent in 2000 to 72 percent in 2003, and access to sewerage has grown from 46 percent to 55 percent during the same period. According to an article written by Interagua for public relations all the \"formally developed areas\" of the city had access to piped water at \"reasonable pressure\" in 2012. However, according to Interagua's own annual report 2009-2010, only an estimated 82 percent of the population (almost 2 million out of a population of 2.43 million) had access to piped water and 67 percent had access to sewerage in July 2010. In 10 years access to piped water supply thus increased from 64 to 82 percent. Customers who gained access to piped water supply were able to consume twice as much water while paying one fifth of what they paid before, when they had bought it from vendors distributing it in tankers. Tankers charged US$ 3.50 per cubic meter, while Interagua charges only 34 cents per cubic meter for the first 15 cubic meters per month.\nThe concessionaire also increased billing efficiency - the share of bills issued that are paid - to about 75 percent by 2003. The number of staff was reduced by 43 percent between 2001 and 2003. This brought the number of staff per 1,000 connections down to less than 3, a level that is consistent with international good practice for an efficient utility.\nSome of the remaining challenges are fluctuating water pressure and high levels of non-revenue water, consisting of both physical and commercial water losses. This is shown by the reports of the independent technical auditor who reviews annually the performance of Interagua. While the report confirmed that in 2010 at least 95 percent of all customers received water at a pressure above the minimum pressure, defined as 5 meters of water column (0.5 bar) in the center of the city and 8 meters of water column (0.8 bar) in the North of the city, the report contained no data about pressure variations and maximal pressure. Interagua wants to achieve constant pressure throughout its service area by 2015 or 2016. In 2010 the level of non-revenue water was 62 percent. This level is much higher than the average in Colombia (49 percent) or in Peru (44 percent).\nThere have been complaints of poor water quality in marginal communities. Residents of Guasmo Sur complained of turbid, foul smelling water that is not fit for consumption and residents of Suburbio Oeste have struggled through both a hepatitis outbreak and periodic issues of decreased chlorine content/increased fecal content in the samples from their sector in 2004.\n\n\n== Comparison with public water management in Quito ==\nA 2006 study conducted for the Inter-American Development Bank came to the conclusion that compared to Quito, which is served by a publicly managed water utility, water quality was worse in Guayaquil, the poor had less access to piped water and water tariffs were higher. In terms of trends, the study concluded that between 1995 and 2005 \"poor homes decreased their likelihood of having access to water in Guayaquil relative to Quito\".\n\n\n== External links ==\nInteragua (Concessionaire)\nECAPAG - Organismo de Control y Regulaci\u00f3n de la Concesi\u00f3n (Regulator)\n\n\n== References ==",

He went on to serve as an officer in the Royal Air Force for nine years, fulfilling tours in Las Vegas, Turkey and Iraq. After reaching the rank of Flight Lieutenant, he resigned his commission in 1997.\nAfter studying for a postgraduate diploma in broadcast journalism, McCartney worked as a reporter for BBC Radio Leeds, notably interviewing Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam in 1997. From 1998 he worked as a presenter on ITV's Calendar News.\nMcCartney stood as a Liberal Democrat candidate for the Pudsey ward of Leeds City Council in 2006.\n\n\n== Member of Parliament ==\nHe was selected as the Conservative prospective parliamentary candidate for the Colne Valley in March 2007. He stood in the 2010 general election taking the seat with a majority of 4,837. McCartney gave his maiden speech on 17 June 2010 in a debate on the economy, expressing his support for local rural Post Offices. He was one of the few Conservative members of Parliament who voted against an increase to the cap on University Tuition fees and supported the need for a referendum on the EU. McCartney holds strong views on welfare, and consistently voted to reduce housing benefit, and generally voted against raising welfare benefits in line with prices.\nIn November 2010, William Hague appointed McCartney to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly UK Delegation.\nMcCartney served on the Transport Committee between 2013 and 2015\nIn the run up to the 2015 general election, McCartney took the unusual step of replying to a constituent who disagreed with the Coalition's austerity plan with a letter recommending they backed the Green Party candidate instead. McCartney told the constituent he respected their differences of opinion but the Green Party candidate was \"the only candidate who matches what you believe\". Labour accused him of trying to split the left wing vote, whilst McCartney said he often put constituents in touch with political rivals if he believed it could help.\nMcCartney supported Brexit in the 2016 European Union Referendum  He voted to reject an amendment to the Brexit bill which demanded an analysis of the impact of exiting the EU on the NHS \n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMcCartney lives in Honley, West Yorkshire, and has two children.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJason McCartney MP official constituency website\nJason McCartney MP Conservative Party profile\nColne Valley Conservatives\n\nProfile at Parliament of the United Kingdom\nContributions in Parliament at Hansard 2010\u2013present\nVoting record at Public Whip\nRecord in Parliament at TheyWorkForYou\nProfile at Westminster Parliamentary Record",

            "content": "The Terracotta Dog (Il cane di terracotta) is a 1996 novel by Andrea Camilleri, translated into English in 2002 by Stephen Sartarelli. It is the second novel in the internationally popular Inspector Montalbano series.\nWhile chasing down a mafia crime, Montalbano finds a cave with symbolic artifacts and the bodies of two young lovers, hidden since World War II.\nWhile it was the second of the published books, the movie was actually produced by RAI out of order, two years later in 2000, as the 4th film.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story starts off with \"Tano Il Greco\", a tired mafia boss, making a deal with Montalbano to stage his arrest in order for him to save face. The arrest causes Montalbano to have to appear at a press conference and be considered for promotion, both of which he does not appreciate. At the same time there has also been a seemingly unrelated and mysterious theft of a grocery store delivery truck; the truck is discovered the next morning, abandoned, with the stolen goods still within and intact.\nAn old man, Misucara, who was witness to the robbery, then dies in a suspicious accident, but not before passing on an odd bit of information to the inspector: that the grocery store owner's car was parked nearby during the time of the robbery. When Tano ends up dying at the hands of mafia rivals during a police transfer, he passes on information to Montalbano that leads the inspector and his team to search for a secret cave used as a black market goods store during WWII and now used for smuggling arms for the mafia, in which the grocery store owner was complicit.\nMontalbano notices that the inside of the cave is not symmetrical and figures out there must be a secret room, where he discovers the mummified bodies of two young lovers, carefully arranged in what appears to be some kind of ancient ritual guarded by a terracotta dog. Learning that the bodies were placed sometime around the allied invasion (sbarcare) and devastating bombing of the island at the end of World War II, Montalbano interviews local residents from that time to try to piece together who the young couple were, why they were killed and why they were ritually buried.\nThe young couple turn out to be Lisetta, a local girl with a sexually abusive father, and her lover Mario, a young Italian soldier stationed at a repair ship that had been docked for an extended period at the town of Vigata. Believing that his ship was to be called to sail soon, Mario had implored Lisetta to come see him one last time, and she had run away then, which resulted in the two lovers presumably being killed when discovered by the jealous father of Lisetta.\nThis knowledge, however, does not satisfy the inspector, as while he had deciphered the identity of the couple and the reason for their murder, the ritualistic method of their burial still remained a mystery. One thing that puzzles Montalbano as he learns more about the ritual burial is that it doesn't make sense, because it is a mixture of different traditions, and this leads him to look for someone who might have knowledge of different burial rites. And once he has a suspect for the person that conducted the ritual burial, Montalbano stages an elaborate ploy to get onto the TV news so that maybe his suspect living in some other part of Italy might get his message and return to the site of the crime 50 years later.\nIt turns out Lisetta's cousin Lillo, who had been very fond of his little cousin, had put up the couple at Lisetta's request in his house. However, the couple had been killed one day when Lillo was out of the house by Lisetta's father's man. Lillo, in his rage, then killed the man. In a state of denial over the incident, he then buries the two lovers in a ritual miming the legend of the Seven Sleepers, in the hopes that like the sleepers, they will reawaken one day. Due to his academic work in studying the legend, he invokes both Christian and Islamic elements in the ritual. He then left Sicily in the hopes of putting all this behind him, until the Inspector resurrected the lovers with his discovery.",

            "content": "The 1971\u201372 British Home Championship was the first such Home Nations football tournament (although not the last), to suffer during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, when death threats from the Provisional Irish Republican Army were sent to the Scottish Football Association and Scottish players who were scheduled to play at Windsor Park. The surge in anti-British feeling which prompted these threats followed Bloody Sunday in January, and also resulted in the cancellation of the rugby union 1972 Five Nations Championship. As a result, Northern Ireland's home fixture was rescheduled to Hampden Park, effectively granting the Scottish team an extra home match. This was not the last time that The Troubles would interfere with the Home Championship; the 1981 British Home Championship would have to be abandoned following similar heightened tension after the death of Bobby Sands.\nScotland used their home advantage well, securing victory over the Irish and Welsh to take a major points advantage into the final match against England, who had lost at home to Northern Ireland following a heavy defeat of Wales. In the last match however, England gained a slight advantage over their old rivals, winning 1\u20130 and thus equalling the tournament on points and resulting in a shared victory (goal difference was not at this stage used to differentiate between teams). The Welsh salvaged a point in their final home game to Northern Ireland, but still finished bottom of the table.\n\n\n== Table ==\nThe points system worked as follows:\n2 points for a win\n1 point for a draw\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull Results and Line-ups",

She attended John Colet School in Wendover. While walking around the Camden Market area, she was scouted by agent Sarah Leon. Frost was only 13 at the time and Leon thought she was too young to model. Two years later, Frost was once again discovered by agents from Select Model Management, this time at a Clothes Show Live trade show event.\n\n\n== Career ==\nFrost first gained the spotlight when photographer Steven Klein requested to shoot with her, and her career took off. Her catwalk debut was at the Spring 2007 Julien MacDonald show in London. She later appeared on the cover of the Evening Standard.\nFrost has been used as the face for many campaigns. Her first was with Burberry, working alongside Kate Moss and Stella Tennant. The next season, she booked the Burberry campaign for the second time in a row. She has also been used for Anna Molinari, H&M, and Dolce and Gabbana.\nFrost has appeared in many high fashion editorials for some of the most coveted magazines in the fashion industry, such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and i-D. Her catwalk appearances include shows for international designers and fashion houses like Heatherette, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, Shiatzy Chen, Peter Som, and Karl Lagerfeld.\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeorgia Frost at the Fashion Model Directory \n\n\n== References ==",

He was born in Gori (Eastern Georgia). In 1955 he graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy of the Moscow State University. From 1968 to 1987 he was a Deputy Editor of the scientific journal \"Voprosi Filosofii\" (\"Questions of Philosophy\"). He became a Professor of the Moscow State University and a Senior Research Fellow of the Moscow Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Science. From 1987-1990 Mamardashvili was head of the Department of the Tsereteli Institute of Philosophy of the Georgian Academy of Sciences and Professor of the Tbilisi State University.\nIn his life only a few books were published, his lectures (for his style of lecturing he and others called them \"conversations\" or \"dialogues\" and he was called \"russian (or georgian) Socrates\") were taped and published after his death by his disciple Yuri Senokosov. Lecturing abroad, Mamardashvili gave talks in Germany, France, and other countries. He died from a heart attack at a Moscow Airport on November 25, 1990.\nInfluenced by Ren\u00e9 Descartes and classical German philosophy (especially Immanuel Kant), Mamardashvili contributed to rationalist theory of perception. His main research fields were: general gnoseological notion of processes of analysis and synthesis, the methodology of science and of the historic-philosophical studies, the role of consciousness in social being, the relationship between consciousness and the aesthetics, the overall meta-theory of language and consciousness. He considered the consciousness the ultimate subject of philosophy. Some of the most famous phrases, coined by Mamardashvili are: \"consciousness is paradoxicalness impossible to get used to\" (same-titled article can be found here: https://web.archive.org/web/20130328102318/http://philosophy.ru/library/mmk/paradox.html ), \"consciousness is an experience of inexperiencable experiences\", \"phenomenology is the accompanying feature of all the philosophy\", \"loneliness is my profession\" and so on.\nIn the preview to the edition of the major compilation of his works by St.-Petersburg publishing house \"Azbooka-classica\" in 2002 he has been introduced \"one of the most interesting contemporary philosophers, the man of impeccable style, magical fascination and rare kindness\". There also was noted there, that all of his interests have been concentrated on the human personality, its freedom and responsibility, on the role of philosophy in life and its place in the culture.\nIn May 2001 a monument to him was unveiled in Tbilisi.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nThe process of analysis and synthesis (1958)(\"\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u044b \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430 \u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0430\")\nForms and Contents of Thinking (1968) (\u0424\u043e\u0440\u043c\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f)\nConverted form [1970] ( \"\u0424\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f\" - article for the Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\nSymbol and Consciousness (\u0421\u0438\u043c\u0432\u043e\u043b \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435), (1974), together with A.Piatigorsky (published 1982)\nThe Problem of Objective Method in Psychology (1977)\nThe Arrow of Cognition (1978)\nClassic and Non-classic Ideals of Rationality (1984) (\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438)\nPhenomenology and its Role in Contemporary Philosophy (1988)\nHow Do I Understand Philosophy?

            "content": "The Federative Republic of Brazil is a union of 27 Federative Units (Portuguese: Unidades Federativas, UF): 26 states (estados) and one federal district (distrito federal), where the federal capital, Bras\u00edlia, is located. The states are generally based on historical, conventional borders which have developed over time.\nThe Federal District is not a state, but shares some characteristics of a state as well as some of a municipality. The codes given below are defined in ISO 3166-2:BR.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe present states of Brazil trace their history directly to the captaincies established by Portugal following the Treaty of Tordesillas which divided part of South America between Portugal and Spain.\nThe first administrative divisions of Brazil were the hereditary captaincies (capitanias heredit\u00e1rias), stretches of land granted by the Portuguese Crown to noblemen or merchants with a charter to colonize the land. As the map shows, these divisions generally followed lines of latitude. Each of the holders of these captaincies was referred to as a captain donatary (capit\u00e3o donat\u00e1rio). These captaincies were to be passed from father to son, but the Crown retained the power to revoke them, which the King indeed did in the 16th century.\nIn 1549, the Portuguese Crown appointed Tom\u00e9 de Sousa as the first governor-general of the vast Portuguese dominion in South America. This dominion overall became known as the State of Brazil (Estado do Brasil). In several periods of history, the northern half of the dominion was detached from the State of Brazil, becoming a separate entity known as the State of Maranh\u00e3o. Maranh\u00e3o by then referred not only to current Maranh\u00e3o, but rather to the whole of the Amazon region; the name mar\u00e3-n\u00e3 in old Tupi language means \"wide river\", referring to the Amazon River.\nAfter the Iberian Union (1580\u20131640), the territory of Portuguese colonial domains in South America was more than doubled, and the land was divided into hereditary and royal captaincies, with the latter being governed directly by the Crown. Unlike Spanish America, the whole territory remained united under a single governor-general (with the permanent title of viceroy after 1720), based in Salvador (after 1763, in Rio de Janeiro). This arrangement later helped to keep Brazil as a unified nation-state, avoiding fragmentation similar to that of the Spanish domains.\nIn 1759, the heritability of the captaincies was totally abolished by the government of the Marquis of Pombal, with all captains becoming appointed by the Crown. The captaincies were officially renamed \"provinces\" on 28 February 1821.\nWith independence, in 1822, the former captaincies became provinces of the Empire of Brazil. Most internal boundaries were kept unchanged from the colonial period, generally following natural features such as rivers and mountain ridges. Minor changes were made to suit domestic politics (such as transferring the Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro from Goi\u00e1s to Minas Gerais, splitting Paran\u00e1 and transferring the south bank of the S\u00e3o Francisco River from Pernambuco to Bahia), as well as additions resulting from diplomatic settlement of territorial disputes by the end of the 19th century (Amap\u00e1, Roraima, Palmas). When Brazil became a republic in 1889, all provinces immediately became states.\nIn 1943, with the entrance of Brazil into the Second World War, the Vargas regime detached seven strategic territories from the border of the country in order to administer them directly: Amap\u00e1, Rio Branco, Acre, Guapor\u00e9, Ponta Por\u00e3, Igua\u00e7u and the archipelago of Fernando de Noronha. After the war, the first four territories became states, with Rio Branco and Guapor\u00e9 being renamed Roraima (1962) and Rond\u00f4nia (1956), respectively, whilst Ponta Por\u00e3 and Igua\u00e7u remained as territories.\nIn 1960, the square-shaped Distrito Federal was carved out of Goi\u00e1s in preparation for the new capital, Bras\u00edlia. The previous federal district became Guanabara State, but in 1975 it was merged with Rio de Janeiro State, retaining its name and with the municipality of Rio de Janeiro as its capital.\nIn 1977, Mato Grosso was split into two states. The northern area retained the name Mato Grosso while the southern area became the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, with Campo Grande as its capital. The new Mato Grosso do Sul incorporated the territory of Ponta Por\u00e3 and the northern part of Igua\u00e7u. Central Igua\u00e7u went to Paran\u00e1, and southern Igua\u00e7u went to Santa Catarina.\nIn 1988, the northern portion of Goi\u00e1s became the state of Tocantins, with Palmas as its capital. Also archipelago Fernando de Noronha became part of Pernambuco.\n\n\n== Government ==\nThe government of each state of Brazil is divided into executive, legislative and judiciary branches.\nThe state government constitutes the executive branch in each of the states. It is headed by a state governor and also includes a vice-governor, several secretaries of state\u2014each one in charge of a given portfolio\u2014and the state attorney-general.\nThe state legislature branch is the legislative assembly, a unicameral body composed of state deputies.\nThe judiciary in each of the states is made up of a Court of Justice and the judges of law. The judges of law constitute courts of first instance. The Court of Justice is the court of second instance of the state and is composed of judges called desembargadores.\n\n\n== Evolution of state divisions ==\n\n\n=== Proposed division of Par\u00e1 ===\nOn 11 December 2011, a consultative referendum was held in the state of Par\u00e1 about splitting that state into three new ones (Par\u00e1, Tapaj\u00f3s and Caraj\u00e1s). Both Tapaj\u00f3s and Caraj\u00e1s were rejected by the population by approximate margins of 2:1.\n\n\n== List ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBrazil socio-geographic division\nList of Brazil state name etymologies\nList of Brazilian states by area\nList of Brazilian states by murder rate\nList of Brazilian states by population\nBrazilian states by Human Development Index\nProvinces of Brazil\nRegions of Brazil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEconomic statistical data for Brazil's 26 states and federal district (in English, Portuguese, and Spanish)\nStates of Brazil at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n Wikimedia Atlas of Brazil\nMap of Brazil, showing states and their regular timezones\n\"Em 2012, Sudeste concentrava 55,2% do PIB do pa\u00eds e o DF tinha o maior PIB per capita\" (in Portuguese).

            "content": "Palmietfontein Airport was an airport situated to the south of Johannesburg (Katlehong), South Africa, in the mid-1940s to early 1950s.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPalmietfontein Airport was a wartime air force base which was converted to a temporary airport to serve Johannesburg whilst the new airport, Jan Smuts Airport (now OR Tambo International Airport), was being built. The airport serving Johannesburg at the time, Rand Airport, was unable to accommodate the size of aircraft to be operated on a new service to Great Britain. In 1948, South African Airways moved its terminal to Palmietfontein Airport.\nSeveral historical flights terminated at Palmietfontein Airport. A Qantas Airways Avro Lancastrian completed an unprecedented flight from Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport in Australia to Palmietfontein, landing on 20 November 1948 at 15h15, and having been in the air a total of 41 hours and 52 minutes at an average speed of 210 mph (180 kn; 340 km/h). En-route stops were made at Perth, Cocos Islands and Mauritius. The objective, to establish viable air links between South Africa and Australia, had been accomplished. The world\u2019s first passenger jet service took place on 3 May 1952 when a BOAC de Havilland Comet 1 landed at Palmietfontein on a flight from the UK.\n\n\n== Airport layout ==\n\nThere were three runways, the relative positions of which formed a triangle. Runway 17/35 was the longest, being 6,000 ft long (1,800 m) and 180 ft wide (55 m). Runway 04/22 was 4,500 ft in length (1,400 m) and runway 13/31 was 4,950 ft long (1,510 m). Both 17/35 and 04/22 were tarred; 13/31 was grass. The apron and control tower were situated to the west of runway 04/22. The airport elevation was given as 5,107 ft amsl (above mean sea level) (1,557 m). The information is derived from an old map and airport layout diagram courtesy of E. Du Plessis.\n\n\n== Aircraft types that operated to and from Palmietfontein ==\nDouglas DC-3\nLockheed Lodestar\nLockheed Constellation\nde Havilland Comet\nAvro Lancastrian\nHandley Page Hermes\n\n\n== Accidents and Incidents ==\n\n\n=== Accidents at the airport ===\nOn 5 January 1948, a Lockheed 18-08-01 Lodestar, ZS-ASW, was damaged beyond repair when it struck a water drain after running off the runway during the landing rollout.\n\n\n=== Aircraft bound to or from Palmietfontein ===\nOn 15 May 1948, a Douglas C-49K (DC-3) ZS-BWY, was en route to Palmietfontein from Stamford Hill Airport, Durban, when it crashed into a hill in bad weather with the loss of all 13 on board.\nOn 15 September 1952, a South African Airways Douglas C-47A-30-DL(DC-3) ZS-AVI with 19 occupants was written off when they landed at Carolina after becoming lost on a flight from Livingstone, Zambia to Palmietfontein. The landing occurred at night and the strip was unlighted. There were no fatalities.\n\n\n== Palmietfontein today ==\nPalmietfontein was transformed into a motor racing circuit for the 1956 Rand Grand Prix, which was won by Peter Whitehead. The township of Katlehong was eventually established on the site, although parts of the original runway are still visible on Google Maps to this day.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGooney Bird's Blog\nPictures of Palmietfontein by Etienne Du Plessis",

            "content": "John \"Deeksie\" Deeks (born 1 May 1951) is an Australian television and radio presenter and voice artist for the Seven Network, where he has been working since 1975 based in Melbourne.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nFor many years Deeks was the announcer who said \"Come on Down!\" on the Australian version of game show The New Price Is Right, although frequently the program's host Ian Turpie is erroneously named as the person to voice the phrase. Deeks was also the announcer on game show Man O Man and presented the Tattslotto lottery draw for many years.\nHe has acted as announcer on several popular programs, making his voice and style highly recognisable, leading to his being cast as voice over artist in recreations of game shows in some dramatic works.\nHe is best known as the announcer of the now-defunct Wheel of Fortune (which he joined in 1984), on the Seven Network. During Deeks' time on Wheel of Fortune he would travel to Adelaide where the show was taped between 1981 and 1996, (as did the show's host John Burgess who would travel from his home in Perth. Hostess and letter-turner Adriana Xenides lived in Adelaide) each weekend to work on the show and often used his comedic skills to entertain the studio audience between takes.\nDeeks departed Wheel in 1996 to host Family Feud, taking over from Rob Brough. After Feud was cancelled later that year, Deeks returned to his old gig as Wheel's voice-over man, which continued until the show's cancellation on 28 July 2006, at which point Deeks was offered a position at the Collingwood Football Club, which he accepted.\nIn addition to providing the audience warm-up for Australia's Got Talent, Wheel of Fortune and Deal or No Deal, \"Deeksie\"' is a continuity announcer for Seven Network stations across Australia, voicing trails, promos and ratings & announcements. He also voices commercials for Australian retailers such as JB Hi-Fi.\nDeeks is also a former co-host of radio program Family Counsellor on 3UZ.\nHe also does the introduction to Wil Anderson's podcast TOFOP.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Deeks on IMDb",

            "content": "Shuto Expressway (\u9996\u90fd\u9ad8\u901f\u9053\u8def, Shuto K\u014dsoku D\u014dro, lit. Metropolitan Expressway) is a network of toll expressways in the Greater Tokyo Area of Japan. It is operated and maintained by the Metropolitan Expressway Co., Ltd. (\u9996\u90fd\u9ad8\u901f\u9053\u8def\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, Shuto K\u014dsoku D\u014dro Kabushiki-gaisha).\nMost routes are grade-separated (elevated roads or tunnels) and central routes have many sharp curves and multi-lane merges which require caution to drive safely. The speed limit is 60 km/h on most routes, but 80 km/h on the Bayshore Route, and 50 km/h on the Inner Circular Route.\nAll trips on the expressway require a toll be paid. As of 2014, the cash toll for a standard-size car is \u00a5930 regardless of distance travelled. Vehicles using the ETC toll-collection system pay a distance-based toll ranging from \u00a5510 to \u00a5930 for ordinary vehicles (see toll price) \u2013 in some cases substantially less than the previous fixed-rate toll. Lower cash rates exist for certain radial routes (where there are only a few kilometers of expressway remaining) and ETC users have various time-of-day discounts. For large vehicles, the toll is doubled.\n\n\n== Routes ==\nThere are 24 routes currently in operation:\n\n\n=== Circular (loop) routes ===\nC1 Inner Circular Route\nC2 Central Circular Route \u2014 loop incorporating the Yamate Tunnel.\nY Yaesu Route \u2014 via Tokyo Expressway\n\n\n=== Bayshore route ===\nB Bayshore Route (Higashi-Kanto-Expressway \u2013 ) Chidori-cho \u2013 Sachiura / Namiki ( \u2013 Yokohama\u2013Yokosuka Expressway)\n\n\n=== Radial routes ===\nNo. 1 Ueno Route Edobashi JCT \u2013 Iriya\nNo. 1 Haneda Route Hamazakibashi JCT \u2013 Haneda ( \u2013 Route K1)\nNo. 2 Meguro Route Ichinohashi JCT \u2013 Togoshi / Ebara\nNo. 3 Shibuya Route Tanimachi JCT \u2013 Yoga ( \u2013 the Tomei Expressway)\nNo. 4 Shinjuku Route Miyakezaka JCT \u2013 Takaido ( \u2013 the Chuo Expressway)\nNo. 5 Ikebukuro Route Takebashi JCT \u2013 Bijogi JCT ( \u2013 Route S5)\nNo. 6 Mukojima Route Edobashi JCT \u2013 Horikiri JCT ( \u2013 Route C2)\nNo. 6 Misato Route Kosuge JCT \u2013 Misato JCT ( \u2013 Tokyo Gaikan Expressway)\nNo. 7 Komatsugawa Route Ryogoku JCT \u2013 Ichinoe ( \u2013 Keiyo Road)\nNo. 9 Fukagawa Route Hakozaki JCT \u2013 Tatsumi JCT ( \u2013 Bayshore Route)\nNo. 10 Harumi Route Ariake JCT \u2013 Toyosu\nNo. 11 Daiba Route Shibaura JCT \u2013 Ariake JCT (Tokyo Rainbow Bridge)\nNo. 12 Daiba Route Shibaura JCT \u2013 Ariake JCT (Tokyo Rainbow Bridge)\n\n\n=== Kanagawa routes ===\nK1 Yokohane Route (Route 1 \u2013 ) Haneda - Ishikawa-cho JCT ( \u2013 Route K3)\nK2 Mitsusawa Route Kinko JCT \u2013 Mitsuzawa ( \u2013 Yokohama Shindo Road and Daisan Keihin Road)\nK3 Kariba Route Honmoku JCT \u2013 Kariba ( \u2013 Yokohama Shindo Road and Yokohama-Yokosuka Expressway)\nK5 Daikoku Route (Route K1 \u2013 ) Namamugi JCT - Daikoku JCT ( \u2013 Bayshore Route)\nK6 Kawasaki Route Tonomachi \u2013 Kawasaki-Ukishima JCT ( \u2013 Bayshore Route and Tokyo Bay Aqualine)\nK7 Yokohama Kita Route (Route K1 and Route K5 \u2013 ) Namamugi JCT - Yokohama Kouhoku JCT ( \u2013 Daisan Keihin Road)\n\n\n=== Saitama routes ===\nS1 Kawaguchi Route (Route C2 \u2013 ) Kohoku JCT \u2013 Kawaguchi JCT ( \u2013 Tokyo Gaikan Expressway)\nS2 Saitama Shintoshin Route (Route S5) Yono \u2013 SaitamaMinuma\nS5 Omiya Route (Route 5 \u2013 ) Bijogi JCT \u2013 Yono ( \u2013 Route S2)\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Metropolitan Expressway was first built between Kyobashi Exit in Ch\u016b\u014d, Tokyo and Shibaura Exit in Minato, Tokyo in 1962 for the purpose of increasing traffic flow efficiency in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, thus optimizing and improving the functionality of the traffic system. Since then, 280 kilometres of highway network has been built in the Tokyo metropolitan area; 30 kilometres more of highway are either constructed or planned, making the Metropolitan Expressway a vast network of urban expressways in the Tokyo region.\n\n\n== Motorcycles with passengers ==\nLike all other expressways in Japan, two-wheeled motorcycles with passengers were banned for many years. Even though a legal amendment on 1 April 2005 generally allows a person aged at least 20 with a motorcycle driver license for at least 3 years to carry a passenger on a two-wheel motorcycle on an expressway, some segments of the Shuto still prohibit passengers. These segments include the important C1 route and adjoining central Tokyo routes. With the opening of the Yamate Tunnel Ohashi junction in 2010, motorcycles with passengers are finally able to pass through the Shuto Expressway from the Tomei to other expressways using the C2 route, although this can be a much longer drive in some cases. See this map for details.\n\n\n== Parking areas ==\nThere are 21 parking areas scattered throughout the Shuto Expressway system. In general these are much smaller than the service areas available every 30 km or so on inter-city expressways. In some cases they are no more than toilets, a few vending machines, and a handful of parking spaces. None have fuel \u2013 drivers must exit the system (and pay the toll again on re-entry) to use a service station.\n\n\n== Street racing ==\nLike all other expressways in Japan including the Tomei Expressway, the Shuto line has become a common street racing road. One of the lines, Bayshore Route (or known as the Wangan by hashiriya), received worldwide notoriety during the 1990s as the home course for the MidNight Club, one of the most notorious street racing clubs, who were known for their 300 km/h, sometimes 320 km/h exploits.\nDue to this infamy, the Wangan is the setting for several entertainment properties, such as the manga and arcade game Wangan Midnight, video games Shutokou Battle and Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6 (without traffic) and the movie series Shuto Kousoku Trial. Numerous car enthusiast magazines and DVDs, like Best Motoring, also highlight races and activities on the Wangan.\n\n\n== See also ==\nExpressways of Japan\nJapan Highway Public Corporation\nWangan Midnight\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange (Chinese: \u9999\u6e2f\u5546\u54c1\u4ea4\u6613\u6240; abbreviated as HKMEx) was an electronic commodities exchange established in Hong Kong for the trading of commodity futures, options and other financial derivatives. The exchange was originally pitched as a platform to trade oil futures. In fact, it ended up trading mainly silver and gold futures.\nThe exchange provided standardised, cleared, and exchange-traded products on a transparent pricing platform to the Asia-Pacific time zone. It was created to eliminate market liquidity risks associated with Asian market participants trading in faraway commodities exchanges such as New York and London.\nOn 18 May 2013, the exchange ceased to trade upon surrendering its authorisation to provide automated trading services. The Hong Kong Police have made a series of arrests in connection with the exchange, and are investigating its chairman, Barry Cheung.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe exchange was announced at a Hong Kong press conference on 25 June 2008 by chairman Barry Cheung Chun-yuen. In attendance was Hong Kong Financial Secretary John Tsang who said there is \"a huge opportunity for Hong Kong to develop a commodities futures market\" in Hong Kong. In March 2009, HKMEx appointed Albert Helmig, a former vice-chairman of NYMEX, as President of the exchange to lead day-to-day operations of the bourse.\nThe exchange positioned itself as a trading forum located in Hong Kong \u2013 a jurisdiction entirely open to the free movement of capital and market participation by non-domiciled investors, while at the same time offering international market participants access to the booming mainland Chinese commodities market. However, the China Securities Regulatory Commission denied authorisation to any offshore exchange to set up commodities futures delivery business. It was not a full brokerage, but was licensed by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) for automated trading services.\nIn June 2009, HKMEx and LCH.Clearnet agreed initial terms for LCH.Clearnet to provide clearing for the exchange. In September, HKMEx signed a contract with Hong Kong International Airport to use HKIA's Precious Metals Depository as a licensed storage venue for gold traded on the exchange.\nIn December 2009, ICBC (Asia) acquired a 10% equity stake in the company, and said it intends to participate extensively in the exchange's operations as a trading and clearing member, as well as a settlement bank. This was followed by a June 2010 announcement that En+ Group, owned by Russia's Oleg Deripaska, had also purchased a 10% equity interest.\nOn 18 May 2011, HKMEx formally began trading with a US dollar gold futures contract. In an interview with Reuters, Helmig said it plans to launch gold and silver futures contracts denominated in renminbi. He also said HKMEx will follow precious metals products with contracts in base metals, and then energy and agriculture. On 22 July 2011, the exchange launched a second product, a US Dollar silver futures contract. Its headquarters were at Cyberport, occupying over 47,000 square feet.\nAs of 5 pm on 13 February 2012, trading on HKMEx's gold and silver futures reached 1,003,210 contracts, representing total turnover of over US$50 billion (around HK$390 billion). Trading on the exchange's US-dollar gold futures for the first time surpassed the 10,000 contract mark on 4 June 2012.\nOn 2 August 2012, the exchange appointed Jane Wang and William Barkshire as co-presidents, following the retirement of Albert Helmig.\n\n\n== Collapse ==\nOn 18 May 2013, the exchange surrendered its authorisation to provide automated trading services, citing insufficient revenue to support its operating expenses. The exchange had been experiencing low trading volumes amidst competition from rivals in other countries and its financial reserves were depleted. The firm had announced it intended to issue HK$780 million worth of shares in March 2013, but had postponed it until June. There had also been rumours that, prior to the shut-down, Chairman Barry Cheung had obtained a loan of HK$100 million from a \"major property businessman and supporter\" of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. New World Development chairman Henry Cheng denied he nor his firm had ever \"had any financial and business dealing\" with either the HKMEx or Cheung. Mr. Cheung said that HKMEx would reapply for the license after the business is recapitalised after its rights issue June.\nOn 21 May 2013, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission announced it was investigating \"suspected irregularities in [HKMEx] financial affairs\" and that it was referring the matter to the Hong Kong Police. As of 25 May 2013, at five people had been arrested in connection with events connected to the exchange, including the alleged possession of false financial instruments.  The government has said that Barry Cheung is under investigation.\nThe collapse of HKMEx has potential political implications for the Hong Kong government, as its chairman Barry Cheung, held a number of senior government positions and is closely identified with HK chief executive CY Leung. Cheung took leave of absence from his official duties. He has since resigned not only from his government posts, but also from several private company boards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of futures exchanges\nList of traded commodities\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHong Kong Mercantile Exchange Official Website\nSecurities and Futures Commission Official Website\nWorld Gold Council Official Website",

            "content": "The Sight is a children's fantasy novel. It was released April 24, 2007, and it is the first installment of the Warriors: Power of Three series by Erin Hunter. This book was recommended as Children's Summer reading by the Washington Post Children's Book Club.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nIn the prologue, it is revealed that after the conclusion of Firestar's Quest, a prophecy was sent to Firestar. After a report of a fox and her cubs loose in ThunderClan territory, the three kits, Lionkit, Hollykit, and Jaykit secretly leave camp and try to track down the foxes and help their Clan. They end up in trouble, but are saved by a patrol. As time goes by, Hollykit decides she wants to become a medicine cat apprentice to help injured cats and heal sicknesses. A few moons later, Hollypaw becomes Leafpool's (the medicine cat) apprentice; Lionpaw becomes Ashfur's apprentice and Jaypaw becomes Brightheart's apprentice. Jaypaw gets frustrated that he is apprenticed to the warrior with one eye, and he feels the other cats pity him. Jaypaw is commonly frustrated that many cats see his blindness as a weakness, even though he has never known life with sight and therefore uncaring of his blindness. Hollypaw, on the other hand, begins to realize that being a medicine cat might not be the right path for her as she does not like seeing other cats in pain, biting up herbs or mouse bile, (a medicine like paste).\nAt a gathering, all Clans have little to report. Lionpaw quickly befriends WindClan apprentice Heatherpaw who he thinks is pretty. In the middle of the gathering, two unknown cats appear. The Clans realize they are Graystripe, with a new friend, Millie. Graystripe was thought to have died when Twolegs took him away in The New Prophecy series. Instead, he managed to escape with the help of Millie and found the new home with the help of Barley and Ravenpaw. It turns out all the forest was destroyed. The Clans leave and Graystripe and Millie return to ThunderClan, exhausted.\nThe return of Graystripe causes another problem. Firestar appointed Brambleclaw as the new deputy assuming Graystripe had died, yet Graystripe was still alive. To help make the decision on who should be deputy, Firestar sends Leafpool to the Moonpool to talk with StarClan. Leafpool is told that Firestar needs to make his own choice. Jaypaw follows her and when Leafpool sees him, she is amazed. In the end, Brambleclaw stays as deputy since he knows the Clan better.\nWhen a battle with ShadowClan breaks out, Jaypaw can only defeat an enemy apprentice with the help of his sibling telling him where the enemy is. Hollypaw finds the thrill of battling better than chewing up bitter herbs. Jaypaw likewise receives a dream from StarClan telling him he must become a medicine cat because he has a gift to walk in other cat's dreams. Although Jaypaw does not accept this at first, he realizes his blindness would prove as a setback during battle and agrees to become a medicine cat apprentice. Hollypaw and Jaypaw decide to trade roles with Jaypaw becoming Leafpool's apprentice and Hollypaw, Brackenfur's apprentice.\nAt the next Gathering, a dispute breaks out between the Clans. To solve the argument, Squirrelflight shares an idea: to have a special Gathering, just once. All four Clans would meet in ThunderClan territory at sunhigh. Each Clan would have their apprentices compete in different contests; tree climbing, hunting, and fighting. Whichever Clans' apprentice won would pick the prey from the fresh-kill pile first.\nJaypaw is upset that he can't compete, and while staying behind at the camp, he has a vision. He is choking on earth, and he smells badger and fox. He is scrabbling desperately with his paws, until realizes that he is seeing through Lionpaw's eyes. It turns out that, while competing, Lionpaw and Breezepaw fell into a collapsing fox den. Luckily, Jaypaw got there in time to save them along with Crowfeather. The leaders decide that since every Clan won at something, there would be a tie and no Clan would win.\nIn the end, Jaypaw walks in Firestar's dream and hears the prophecy There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws. Realizing that he and his siblings are the cats described in the prophecy, Jaypaw suddenly thinks \"One day we will be so powerful that we shall command even StarClan!\"\n\n\n== Critical reaction ==\nThe Sight quickly mounted #1 on all major sales charts, including the New York Times Bestseller List. It was recommended as Children's Summer reading by the Washington Post Children's Book Club. Booklist gave a positive review saying, \"As in previous books, personal tensions are juxtaposed against dangers from the outside. Plenty of action and solid characterizations make this an enticing choice for fans of the long-running enterprise.\"\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nThe Sight was nominated as the best Middle Readers book at Amazon's Best Books of the Year (2007), and placed sixth out of the ten nominees, with six percent of the total votes.\n\n\n== References ==",

Tickets were $1,000 each and included numerous celebrities, including, the orchestrator of the event, Elton John. Chefs from the city provided food and entertainment was provided by local groups. The concert itself was held outside the museum, using the stage from the Live 8 concert only a few days before. VIP tickets costing $500 allowed people to sit in 25 rows set up in front of the stage; otherwise, it was a standing only event. Over a million people attended.\nThe concert was hosted by Wayne Brady and Bruce Vilanch and included other guests, such as Billie Jean King. Performing were Bryan Adams, Patti LaBelle, Rufus Wainwright, Peter Nero and the Philly Pops, culminating with a performance by Elton John (who was introduced by long-time friend and AIDS activist Billie Jean King). Elton opened with \"The Bitch Is Back\", followed by \"Bennie and the Jets\", \"Rocket Man\", \"I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues\", \"Tiny Dancer\", and ended with \"Philadelphia Freedom\" with the Philadelphia Pops. The concert was followed by a fireworks display.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The Ted Smout Memorial Bridge is a road and pedestrian bridge in Brisbane, Australia, the third bridge crossing Bramble Bay (the first being the now demolished Hornibrook Bridge). It is located 30 metres to the east of the Houghton Highway (which provides the northbound lanes), providing 3 southbound traffic lanes and a bi-directional pedestrian and bicycle path. It connects the Redcliffe suburb of Clontarf with the Brisbane suburb of Brighton, and was opened by then Queensland Premier Anna Bligh on 11 July 2010. The Ted Smout Memorial Bridge (and the adjacent Houghton bridge) were Australia's second longest bridges until 27 March 2013, when the Macleay River Bridge opened in Kempsey, NSW.\nThe bridge consists of 78 spans, each 35 m long. The cost of the bridge was A$315 million. It was built 4 m higher than the Houghton bridge, in order to improve its resilience to storm surges. It is the first bridge in Australia designed to withstand Hurricane Katrina-type cyclonic events. It is also possibly the only Australian bridge which may have to deal with shallow water storm surge.\nThe bridge features\n3 traffic lanes (originally 2 for regular traffic and a T2 (bus, taxi and vehicles with more than 2 occupants) lane, but the T2 lane has now been converted to a regular lane).\nA 4.5 m (15 ft) wide pedestrian and cycle path that connects footpath and cycle networks on either side of Bramble Bay. The path is separated from traffic by a concrete barrier.\nA fishing platform near the Pine River channel. The platform measures 10 m by 50 m.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThe bridge is named 'Ted Smout Memorial Bridge' after Ted Smout, Queensland\u2019s last surviving World War One veteran, who lived in Sandgate and died in 2004. The naming ceremony by Craig Wallace, the then Queensland Minister for Main Roads, took place on 14 July 2009 as part of Queensland\u2019s 150th birthday celebrations. The ceremony also marked the construction of the middle (39th) span of the new bridge.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Houghton Highway bridge was originally built to duplicate the Hornibrook Bridge. However, the refurbishment of the original bridge proved to be uneconomic, and the Houghton bridge was converted to 3 lanes with peak flow lane control. When this reached capacity, another 3 lane bridge was proposed to be built between the Hornibrook and Houghton bridges, at the same height as the latter.\nAfter the original design was finalised, bridges of similar design were extensively damaged by storm surges caused by Hurricane Katrina, and it was necessary to redesign the bridge to be storm-surge resilient, involving raising the deck level by 4 metres. The revised design is distinctly different from the original plan, which was for a similar structure to the Houghton bridge. Its location was shifted to the east side of the Houghton bridge in order to provide it with some level of storm surge protection\nIncreases in the cost of construction materials and labour, changes to the scope of the project following technical investigations and community consultation, extra costs associated with the removal of the Hornibrook bridge, as well as design improvements spurred by the events of Hurricane Katrina meant the total cost increased to $315 million, compared with the $149 million estimated in 2004. The preliminary design went on display in June 2007.\nA falsework platform was used and continually relocated as construction of the bridge segments progressed. Foundation piles were driven up to 39 metres into the sea bed, which were then reinforced with concrete and capped with concrete headstock and girders.

            "content": "Jwala Gutta (born 7 September 1983) is a left-handed Indian badminton player. Born in Wardha to an Indian father and Chinese mother, she began playing badminton at a young age. She is India's most successful doubles specialist, and has won the National Badminton Championships fourteen times. Having represented India at the international circuit since the late 1990s till 2017, partnering Shruti Kurien earlier in her career, Gutta found greater international success with Ashwini Ponnappa. The pair consistently figured among the top-twenty in the BWF World Ranking reaching as high as no. 10 in 2015. She is the first badminton player of Indian to qualify for two events in the Olympics\u2013women's doubles with Ponnappa and mixed doubles with V. Diju at London. Gutta is known for her skilled left-handed stroke-play and is one of the very few notable doubles players who use a forehand service.\nGutta has won numerous medals for Indian badminton including the bronze medal 2011 BWF World Championships in London, and a gold and silver at 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games respectively in the women's doubles event which were the first for the country in the discipline. Other achievements include the historic bronze medal at the 2014 Thomas & Uber Cup held at New Delhi, a bronze medal at Badminton Asia Championships in the same year and final and semi-final appearances in many big international events most notably the finals appearance at the 2009 BWF Super Series Masters Finals, alongside Diju which was the first for the country in any discipline.\nGutta has been credited to have brought recognition for doubles badminton in India, first with her mixed doubles partner Diju with whom she peaked at no. 6 in 2010 becoming the first doubles partnership from the country to be ranked amongst the top-10 and later with her partnership with Ponnappa in women's doubles. She paired with Ponappa at the Rio 2016 Olympics where the pair crashed out in the group stage with two consecutive losses at the hands of opponents from Japan and Netherlands. Gutta has won medals at all major international badminton tournaments and multi-sport events, except for the Olympics.\nIn addition to her badminon career, Gutta has been vociferous for the issues she advocates for, ranging from fair treatment in sports, health and education, women's empowerment and gender equality. She has been listed several times among the top most inspiring sportswomen of India. She was awarded the Arjuna Award, India's second highest sporting award for her achievements. Gutta was married to badminton player Chetan Anand from 2005-2011. She told ESPN that she was contemplating retirement, after entering negotiations for a coaching role for BAI in May 2017.\n\n\n== Early life and junior career ==\nJwala Gutta was born on 7 September 1983 in Wardha, Maharashtra and brought up in Hyderabad, Telangana, to a Telugu father and a Chinese mother. Jwala's father, Kranti Gutta, hailed from a family of freedom fighters and Leftists from Peddapuliveru in Andhra Pradesh's Guntur district. Her mother, Yelan Gutta, was born in Tianjin, and is a granddaughter of a Gandhian named Tseng. Yelan first came to India in 1977 with her grandfather to visit the Sevagram ashram, where she translated Gandhi's autobiography and other works into Chinese language. Gutta has a younger sister, Insi Gutta.\nInitially inclined towards playing tennis, Gutta shifted to badminton at insistence from her mother. She was introduced to the national badminton coach S. M. Arif, by her father at the age of four. Arif recommended her to learn gymnastics or swimming for a couple of years before starting training for badminton. Gutta later started training under Arif, at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium.\nJwala started playing badminton at the age of six. Her chief achievement as a youngster was to win the Under-13 Girls Mini National Badminton Championship held at Thrissur, Kerala. In 2000, Jwala (aged 17) won the Junior National Badminton Championship. The same year, she also won the Women's Doubles Junior National Championship and the Senior National Badminton Championship, both in partnership with Shruti Kurien. This association was to last several years, and the pairing of Jwala Gutta and Shruti Kurien won the Women's Doubles National title for seven years in succession, from 2002 to 2008.\n\n\n== Playing style ==\nGutta likes playing aggressive badminton and has a great affinity for the front court, with her skilled netplay, good anticipation and the ability to play deceptive strokes at the net. She is considered very dangerous in the front court with her good reading of the game and sharp interceptions. She also has a strong smash from the back court and often makes use of deceptive drops. Gutta is vulnerable in a few areas of her game, most evidently in her movement across the court. She can commit certain unforced errors when forced to move out of her favoured positions. She has also had some fitness issues and injury troubles in her long career. Gutta is also known for being one of the only top doubles player to still use the forehand service, since most other doubles specialists opt for the safer backhand serve. She stands unique in this aspect.\n\n\n== Performance in women's doubles ==\n\n\n=== Early years: 2002\u201309 ===\nGutta partnered Shruti Kurien-Kanetkar during the early part of her career for the women's doubles competition. The duo reached the semi-final round of their second international tournament itself, the India Asia Satellite tournament 2002. They also reached the semi-final round of the same tournament in the year 2004, and finished runner-up at the Le Volant d'Or Tournament, known as Toulouse Open the same year. Further, she reached the Final Rounds of the Scottish International tournament 2004 and 40th Portuguese Badminton Championship 2004. In the year 2006, she won the Sri Lanka International Satellite tournament; while in the year 2007, she won the Cyprus Badminton International tournament. The same year, she also won at the Pakistan International Challenge tournament and the Indian International Challenge tournament. Apart from these achievements, Jwala won the Nepal International Series tournament 2008 and Yonex Dutch Open Grand Prix 2008 in the Women's Doubles category.\n\n\n=== 2010: Commonwealth Gold and breakthrough ===\n\nJwala then split with her longtime partner Shruti Kurien due to compatibility issues. She then paired up with young Ashwini Ponnappa from Bangalore who was called up for the national camp just before the Commonwealth Games. She and Ponnappa then went on to win the sensational gold medal in the women's doubles at the New Delhi Commonwealth Games making history of winning the first gold medal for India in the event. They beat much higher ranked Singaporean pair of Shinta Mulia Sari and Yao Lei in the finals 21\u201315, 21\u201319 in front of the cheering home crowd and set the stadium ablaze with their win. Gutta and Ponnappa then became household names after winning the medal in front of home crowd. Since, their Gold Medal effort at the games they brought Women's Doubles into limelight in the country.\nAfter the win Jwala at a press conference stated, \"It's unbelievable. I think it was long pending for me. I am quite emotional. The feeling is yet to sink in. Ashwini played exceptionally well and we hope to continue the good work, I want to dedicate the medal to my family who stood by me, my coaches, especially SM Arif, Atik Jauhari and all the team members, Gopi. I owe this medal to all who helped me,\" and added that \"This medal will silence my critics. This is my answer to them to whatever happened. I am very happy and everyone who has negative thoughts about me, I would like to say just shut-up now,\"\n\n\n=== 2011: World Championships Bronze ===\nIn 2011, they came up with one of their finest performances when the pair etched their names in history books becoming the first Indian pair to ensure a medal at the World Badminton Championships. The pair defeated 12th seeds Vita Marrisa and Nadya Melati of Indonesia 17\u201321, 21\u201310, 21\u201317 to storm into the women's doubles semifinal before losing out to the Chinese fifth seeds in the semi-finals in London, thereby winning a bronze in the Badminton World Championship. They had previously beaten Poon Lok Yan and Tse Ying Suet of Hong Kong 19\u201321, 21\u201317, 21\u201319 in Round of 16. Also, in the second round they had caused a big upset by beating the 2nd seeds and former World Num 1s. Cheng Wen-hsing Chien Yu-chin of Chinese Taipei 21\u201318 21\u201318. In a 2016 report published by Sportskeeda, the feat was ranked as the fifth greatest achievement of Indian badminton.\n\n\n=== 2012: London Olympics ===\nShe played women's doubles as well as mixed doubles at the 2012 London Olympics becoming the first and the only Indian to qualify in two events in the entire history of the game. Jwala pairing with Ashwini Ponappa lost their opening women's doubles match against the Japanese duo of Mizuki Fujii and Reika Kakiiwa. They then went on to beat the much higher ranked Cheng Wen-hsing and Chien Yu-chin of Chinese Taipei 25\u201323, 16\u201321, 21\u201318 to register their first win in the group stages. Jwala and Ashwini missed out on a quarterfinal berth by a difference of just one point, even though they beat Shinta Mulia Sari and Lei Yao of Singapore 21\u201316 21\u201315 in their last group B match, after tying with Japan and Taipei on the number of wins. Prior to India's final group game on Tuesday night, the World number five Japanese pair of Mizuki Fujii and Reika Kakiiwa had shockingly lost to Chinese Taipei's Cheng Wen Hsing and Chien Yu Chin, ranked 10th, 19\u201321 11\u201321. India lodged a formal protest with the Games organizers to probe if the women's doubles badminton match involving Japan and Chinese Taipei was played in the right spirit, following the elimination of medal hopes Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa but no action was taken. Following the Olympic Games, Jwala went to a temporary sabbatical from the game.\n\n\n=== 2013: Comeback and IBL ===\nIn January 2013, Jwala announced her comeback to the game and partnered Prajakta Sawant since Ponnappa was partnering with Pradnya Gadre and had committed to continue her partnership with Gadre so went on play with Sawant, who at that time was going through a battle against national coach Pullela Gopichand. Indian Badminton League (IBL) was announced the same year.\n\nIBL was a franchise league commercially managed by an Indian sports rights management company, Sporty Solutionz as commercial partners. With the brand value of US$1 million, Indian Badminton League was the richest badminton league in the world. Jwala was one of the six marquee players and team captains to be auctioned. The auction itself was not short of controversy. The base price of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa was halved from USD 50,000 to USD 25,000, without the players' notice and Women's Doubles event was replaced by a second Men's Singles. This left both Jwala and Ashwini hurt and angry. Jwala was bought for USD 31,000 and captained the Delhi franchise, but the team did not reach the semis and finished fifth. Gutta and Ponnappa after IBL confirmed on that they were set to reunite. Jwala went on to add that the two decided to come together because of a couple of reasons. The first was the Indian Badminton League's organisers knocking out the women's doubles category from the tournament, which in turn resulted in the base prices of Jwala and Ashwini.\n\n\n=== 2014: Asian and Uber Cup bronze, CWG silver ===\nIn 2014 Jwala and Ashwini won the bronze medal at Asian Championships in April defeating 3rd seeded Thai pair of Kunchala Voravichitchaikul and Duanganong Aroonkesorn 21\u201311, 21\u201318 en route losing out to Chinese twins Luo Ying and Luo Yu at the semi-final stage. The pair played a key role in India's historic Bronze at the Uber Cup in New Delhi. The duo unleashed a giant-killing spree as they had to face much higher ranked opponents in most of their matches and they won each, their biggest win came when outplayed the World No. 9 team of Greysia Polii and Nitya Krishinda Maheswari 21\u201318, 21\u201318 from Indonesia in the first doubles match of the tie. The win took India to the semis for the first time in Uber Cup history and assured them of the bronze medal. They later participated at the 2014 Commonwealth Games and narrowly missed the podium finish in the team event came up with the silver medal at the games losing put to Malaysian pair of Vivian Hoo and Woon Khe Wei in a closely contested final. The Indian pair lost the first game 17\u201321, before going down in a well-fought second game. Jwala and Ponnappa had taken the lead and looked good to take the match into the deciding third game. It was their second medal at the games after the 2010 Gold.\n\n\n=== 2015: Canada GP title and top-10 ranking ===\nJwala and Ashwini kicked started 2015 with a semi-final appearance at 2015 India Open Grand Prix Gold held at Lucknow. They next appeared in the prestigious All England Open reached the 2nd round losing out to the top seeds Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei in straight games. The pair of Gutta and Ponnappa also re-entered the Top-20 rankings after All England.\nIn May, Jwala played for India at the 2015 Sudirman Cup as they were placed in group 1D, clubbed together with three-time winner Korea and Malaysia. The Malaysian team was buoyed by the return of former world no. 1 Lee Chong Wei from a dope-related suspension and that made things difficult for India. India started with a narrow 2\u20133 loss to Malaysia Saina Nehwal and the duo of Gutta and Ponnappa delivered the wins. Jwala and Ashwini stole the show with their determined efforts that saw them upsetting the world no. 11 pair of Vivian Hoo and Woon Khe Wei 21\u201318, 19\u201321, 21\u201315.\nAfter the narrow defeat against Malaysia, India needed to win the tie v Korea to progress into the quarter-finals. Parupalli Kashyap and the men's doubles pair of Pranav Chopra and Akshay Dewalkar lost both their matches the onus was once again on Gutta and Ponnappa. They fought hard but it was not enough to topple the Koreans. Chang Ye Na and Jung Kyung-eun won the contest 18\u201321, 21\u201312, 21\u201312 to seal a 3\u20131 victory for Korea. With defeats in both the rubbers India failed to make the quarter-finals.\nJwala and Ashwini then participated in the 2015 U.S. Open Grand Prix Gold and the pair seeded 4th reached the semi-finals losing out to Japanese pair of Ayane Kurihara and Naru Shinoya 17\u201321, 11\u201321. En route to semis they did not lose a single game and defeated Turkish pair of Neslihan Yi\u011fit and \u00d6zge Bayrak 21\u201310, 21\u201318 and in the quarter-finals defeated German seventh seeds Johanna Goliszewski and Carla Nelte 21\u201317, 21\u201314.\nThe pair next participated in the 2015 Canada Open Grand Prix and seeded third went on to win the title defeating top seeded Dutch pair of Eefje Muskens and Selena Piek 21\u201319, 21\u201316. It was the pairs first title since coming back together after the 2012 Olympics. The win was commended by the Indian media as the duo were the only women's doubles pair from the country to win a Grand Prix title. Jwala expressed her concerns for lack of support for doubles in the country and prompted the association and the government to promote doubles. Jwala told NDTV in an interview, \"We though big wins would wake up concerned people but it hasn't happened yet. We are still confident of representing India at an international level but here, extra support is needed as we can't afford it on our own.\nContinuing their good form Gutta and Ponnappa reached the quarter-final stage of the 2015 BWF World Championships. The pair received a bye in the first round and defeated Hsieh Pei-chen and Wu Ti-jung of Chinese Taipei in straight sets. In the last 16 clash the pair stunned world no. 6 pair of Reika Kakiiwa and Miyuki Maeda from Japan 21\u201315, 18\u201321, 21\u201319. The pair missed out on the bronze medal after losing out to another Japanese pair of Naoko Fukuman and Kurumi Yonao.\nThe quarter-final finish at the World Championships hepled Gutta and Ponnappa jumped 2 places in the BWF World Ranking as they entered the top 10 for the first time in their career. With this Gutta thus became the first player to be ranked in the Top-10 of the world rankings in both the doubles category.\n\n\n=== 2016: PBL & Second Uber Cup Bronze ===\nGutta began her 2016 with the Premier Badminton League, where she represented Hyderbad Hunters alongside Lee Chong Wei and Parupalli Kashyap. She played in the mixed doubles alongside Indonesian Markis Kido and Danish Carsten Mogensen. The team couldn't qualify for the knock-out stage, finishing fifth in the standings.\nIn May, Gutta was part of the Indian team for the 2016 Thomas & Uber Cup held at Kunshan, China. The Indian women's team was put into Group- D alongside Japan, Germany and Australia. The India team beat Germany and Australia 5\u20130 before losing out to Japan to finish second in the group. In the quarter-finals they came back from a 0\u20131 deficit after Saina Nehwal lost the first singles to beat Thailand 3\u20131. Gutta and Ponnappa won their match in straight sets to secure a semifinal berth and the team's second consecutive bronze medal. The Indian team was however beaten by eventual champions China in the semifinal stage.\n\n\n== Performance in mixed doubles ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\nJwala has won titles in the Jakarta Satellite tournament and Welsh International tournament in the year 2005, Sri Lanka International Satellite tournament, Cyprus Badminton International tournament and Indian International Challenge tournament in the year 2007, and Nepal International Series tournament, Bitburger Open Grand Prix tournament and KLRC Bulgaria Open Grand Prix tournament in the year 2008.\n\n\n=== Success and top-10 breakthrough ===\n\nTheir breakthrough came when Gutta and her partner Valiyaveetil Diju became the first Indian badminton mixed doubles pair to win a Grand Prix Gold title. They defeated Indonesia's Hendra Aprida Gunawan and Vita Marissa 24\u201322, 21\u201318 in the Chinese Taipei Open final. In the quarterfinal, the world No. 7 pair and third seed in the tournament, defeated Korean pair Shin Baek-cheol and Yoo Hyun-Young and in the semi-final Diju and Gutta prevailed over Malaysians Goh Liu Ying and Chan Peng Soon 21\u201311, 17\u201321, 24\u201322.\nBut the biggest achievement came in the same year where she and Diju again reached the quarters of the 2009 BWF World Championships and became the first Indians to do so repeating the feat at The Championships the following year. The Championships were held at Hyderabad, India. The duo, seeded 8th, got a bye in the first round followed by a walkover in the second. In the third round they defeated 12th seed Polish pair of Robert Mateusiak and Nadiezda Kostiuczyk 21\u201311 22\u201320 in a 31-minute clash. In the quarterfinal they went down to defending champions and second seeds Nova Widianto and Lilyana Natsir of Indonesia. The Indian pair was beaten 16\u201321, 14\u201321 in 27 minutes.\nThe same year they went on to reach the finals of the BWF Super Series Masters Finals, an annual tournament held at the end of every year where only the top players with the most points from that calendar year's twelve events of the BWF Super Series compete. They beat Robert Mateusiak and Nadie\u017cda Kostiuczyk again in straight-games 21\u201319 21\u201311. In the final the Indian pair went down to World Championship bronze medallists Christinna Pedersen and Joachim Fischer Nielsen from Denmark 21\u201314, 21\u201318. By reaching the tournament finals they became the first Indians to reach the feat in any of the 5 disciplines.\nIn 2010 the pair reached the quarter-finals of the World Championships for the second consecutive year beaten by Koreans Ha Jung-eun and Ko Sung-hyun 21\u201316, 21\u201319 having beaten the English pair of Gabrielle White and Chris Adcock and Malaysians Liu Ying and Peng Soon in straight games and overcoming Yao Lei and Chayut Triyachart from Indonesia in the pre-quarters in three games. The pair also won the 2010 India Open Grand Prix Gold for their second Grand Prix Gold title beating Lei and Triyachart in three games. In 2011 Gutta and Diju reached the quarter-finals or better at three tournaments including two Super Series Premieres events at Denmark Open and China Masters where they reached the semi-finals, their first since 2009. They beat second seeded Chinese pair of Tao Jiaming and Tian Qing in the first round 5\u201321, 21\u201314, 21\u201318.\n\n\n=== 2012 Olympics and sabbatical ===\nGutta and Diju reached two quarter-finals in 2012 at the Victor Korea Superseries Premier Singapore Open Superseries before competing at 2012 Summer Olympics. Pairing with Diju, Jwala lost her opening match 16\u201321, 12\u201321 in just 25 minutes at the Wembley Arena in London Olympics. The pair also lost their next two matches and thus could not qualify for the knockout stage. Despite having enjoyed great success in the Mixed Doubles category, she has shifted her focus on to Women's Doubles event since her sabbatical. In March 2016, Gutta announced a comeback to the mixed category. She stated in her interview that she missed the titles she \"used to win with V Diju\". She confirmed that she would not play alongside Diju but was a looking for a suitable partner and would start playing in April.\n\n\n=== 2016: Comeback to mixed doubles ===\nIn an interview in August 2016, Gutta shared her plans of returning to the mixed doubles competition, without disclosing a probable partner.\n\n\n== Personal life and other works ==\nDuring her badminton career, Gutta began dating fellow badminton player Chetan Anand. The couple married on 17 July 2005 and got divorced on 29 June 2011. The divorce gathered huge and unwanted media attention and speculations about an affair with ex-cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin also came up, but was never confirmed due to lack of any proof of the news and constant denials from Jwala herself. Jwala confirmed filing the divorce but denied that it had anything to do with Azharuddin.\nAzhar had also hinted that these stories had been planted by people in the Badminton Association of India, who wanted to tarnish his image since he tried to contest for the presidents' elections. He said, \"These are planted stories and motivated by people, who are against me in the Badminton Association of India. They are so upsetting.\" In 2013, Jwala said in an interview, \"I learnt a lot from the marriage but we weren't growing as a couple. A part of me forgot that I too was a part of the sport. I was satisfied thinking that his victories were our victories,\"\nJwala has supported some social causes, including women empowerment issues, anti-tobacco and anti-zoo campaigns. She has also been involved in many other campaigns including the Ice Bucket Challenge, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Jwala also launched the Indian Badminton League's (IBL) school programme 'Shuttle Express' in Pune for school children. Speaking during the briefing, Jwala said: \"I am really happy to be here with the kids who are playing not only to win the Shuttle Express but to be the next badminton champion for India. Wishing everyone all the best and I know the Pune participants will make everyone proud.\"\n\n\n== In the media ==\nGutta has been listed as the most inspirational sportswomen from India on numerous occasions. Her outspoken nature has often attracted controversies from various groups. According to Gutta, such controversies do not bother her as she had been taught to speak up for whats right and take a stand for herself and others too. \"My father (Kranti) told me at a young age to fight for what I believed in. I've never learnt to butter up people,\" stated Jwala in an interview with Hindustan Times. \"Controversies don't bother me. I'm not the one who instigates them. But when your name gets dragged into it, you can't keep quiet,\" she said. She said she is targeted because she speaks her mind. S. M. Arif Jwala's coach said, \"This girl, she is there with me since she was 4 years old, from that age she is there with me and one thing about her is that she is the laziest person as far as the training is concerned and as far as the court is concerned you keep her for the whole long day and she will be happy, otherwise her genes might be helping her out.\"\nGutta has spoken against body shaming in sports. In an interview she said, \"I don't understand this image thing. What's wrong in liking clothes or dressing up? In India, there is this image that if you dress shabbily, you are a serious sportsperson. If you care about dressing up, you aren't one. People are under the impression I lead an exciting life but honestly, all I do is sleep, eat and practice\". Gutta is also a celebrity endorser and has been associated with several brands and services, also appearing on the covers of numerous magazines.\n\n\n== IBL row ==\nA controversy had erupted during the August 25 tie of the Indian Badminton League when the Delhi Smashers had threatened to pull out from the lot match against Banga Beats over the last-minute replacement of injured Hu Yun of Hong Kong, with Denmark's Jan \u00d8. J\u00f8rgensen. As the team captain for Smashers, Gutta was involved in a lengthy discussion, which was resolved after Beats agreed to drop Jorgensen. Gutta was then served a 14-day showcause notice by BAI for her conduct during the tie, which was delayed by half an hour. In what was dubbed a surprise decision, the Badminton Association of India's disciplinary committee recommended a life ban on Gutta for the same.\nBAI president Akhilesh Das Gupta had said that if Gutta tenders an unconditional apology, her case may be reconsidered. However, she came cleae that she would not apologise as asked by the BAI. Her camp made note two potential reasons for the harsh stand taken by BAI; first, Gutta had been vocal against the women's doubles event being taken off the competition in IBL, a decision that had created quite a stir before the tournament, and second, the coming together of Gutta and Ponnappa for the women's doubles (who did not trainia at Pullela Gopichand's academy). On the advise of her coach her S. M. Arif, Gutta filed a defamation suit against BAI for going to the press without issuing her a ban notice. \"This is cruellest joke on badminton and on a player of Jwala's calibre,\" Arif said adding that she committed no mistake and hence there is no question of an apology. He said that the BAI had repeatedly insulted the player who has brought laurels to the country.\nBlaming Gopichand, the chief national coach, for \"not supporting her\" in the fiasco, Gutta said she tried to resolve the issue by talking to everyone in the administration even before the show cause notice was issued. She spoke with the press saying, \"I love to play [...] No one on this earth can stop me from playing. In fact, no one should stop anyone from playing. I never thought that they [BAI] would stoop down to this level.\"\nEventually, the Delhi High Court put a stay on BAI's decision to not allow Gutta to play at international tournaments. Justice V.K. Jain told the BAI: \"You must allow her to play.\". During the whole controversy Gutta received overwhelming support from fans and fellow sports-persons. Several former players described the Badminton Association of India disciplinary committee's recommendation of a life ban on the player as \"ridiculous\" and \"harsh\". Former national coach U. Vimal Kumar said the HC order has shown Indian badminton in bad light. S.M. Arif, was even harsher saying, \"The emphasis on her apology rather than the misconduct attributed to her shows clearly that the BAI has gone off the rails,\" Gutta also received support from Petroleum Minister Veerappa Moily, who wrote a letter to Sports Minister Jitendra Singh, saying that Gutta was being treated unfairly and if it continued then the Petroleum sector may be forced to reconsider its association with BAI as various levels. He warned the Sports Ministry be fair to Gutta or lose funding. The Sports Minister responded to Moily's letter saying that he would examine her case and extend all the support to her.\nThe long-standing deadlock between Gutta and the Association ended with the national federation dropping all the charges against her. The impasse was reported to have ended in New Delhi when Jwala met BAI president Akhilesh Das after the 78th Senior National Championships where she had emerged as the doubles champion alongside Ponnappa. \"I am very happy with the decision BAI has taken. I will be playing as a part of the Indian team in future tournaments too. It will be an honour to represent the country as always,\" Gutta was quoted as saying to the Times of India.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nIn 2011, Gutta was awarded the Arjuna award by the Indian Government, India's second highest sporting honour for her achievements as a badminton player.\n\n\n== Career highlights ==\n\n\n=== BWF World Championships ===\nWomen's doubles\n\n\n=== Commonwealth Games ===\nWomen's doubles\n\n\n=== Asia Championships ===\nWomen's doubles\n\n\n=== South Asian Games ===\nWomen's doubles\nMixed doubles\n\n\n=== BWF Superseries ===\nMixed doubles\n     BWF Superseries Finals tournament\n     BWF Superseries Premier tournament\n     BWF Superseries tournament\n\n\n=== BWF Grand Prix ===\nWomen's doubles\nMixed doubles\n\n\n=== BWF International Challenge/Series/Satellite ===\nWomen's doubles\nMixed doubles\n     BWF International Challenge tournament\n     BWF International Series tournament\n\n\n=== BWF events ===\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n2013 \u2013 Gunde Jaari Gallanthayyinde\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJwala GUTTA at BWFbadminton.com\nJwala GUTTA at BWF.tournamentsoftware.com\n\"Jwala Gutta\".

            "content": "Greg Kading is an American author and former Los Angeles Police Department detective best known for working on a multi law-enforcement task force that investigated the murders of rap stars Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls.\n\n\n== Education ==\nKading graduated from Capistrano Valley High School in 1981. He attended Cal State Long Beach and Calvary Bible College.\n\n\n== Career ==\nKading was an Orange County Sheriff's Department deputy, where he worked in the jail, from January 1986 to September 1988. He then joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1988.\nHe was removed from the joint task force when he became the subject of an Internal Affairs investigation. No one was assigned to lead the task force as his replacement, and it was eventually disbanded. He was later cleared of wrongdoing, and returned to the Robbery-Homicide Division.\nHe retired from the department, where he worked in the robbery-homicide division, after 22 years of service in June 2010. The following year, Kading released his book. A full-length documentary adapted from his book began shooting in 2013.\nHe works as a private investigator in Southern California.\n\n\n== Book ==\nIn September 2011, he self-published the book Murder Rap: The Untold Story of the Biggie Smalls & Tupac Shakur Murder Investigations. In it, he included new evidence in the rappers' murders that he said implicated entertainment mogul Sean Combs and CEO of Death Row Records, Suge Knight. The release prompted what MediaBisto.com called \"a new round of explosive media coverage about the unsolved killings.\"\nCombs responded to the allegation by telling Los Angeles local reporters in emails that \"this story is pure fiction and completely ridiculous.\u201d Knight has not addressed the claim. Lil' Cease, a rapper and childhood friend of Smalls, told radio host Sway Calloway on the \u201cSway In The Morning\u201d show that he didn\u2019t believe Combs had ordered Shakur's shooting as Kading alleged in his book.\nThe book also details what Kading described as the behind-the-scenes failure by the LAPD to arrest Shakur\u2019s and Smalls\u2019 killers. The families of Shakur and Smalls have not responded to the allegations.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAuthor's official site",

            "content": "Blockland is a landscape and nowadays a borough of Bremen, Germany. It is part of the Western municipal district and covers an area of 30.3 km\u00b2.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Blockland is part of the marshes of the Hamme, a tributary of the Weser River, and the W\u00fcmme (its main source), both of which are tidal rivers. The average elevation is 1 meter above sea level. Without the dikes along the Hamme and the W\u00fcmme, it would be flooded twice a day.\nSince its cultivation in the 12th century, the Blockland is drained by a network of parallel trenches which cut the area into blocks, giving the area its name.\n\n\n== Population and landuse ==\nThe density of population is quite low, 14 inhabitants per km\u00b2. The settlements are concentrated along the dike. Most of the land use is Greenland economy of pastures and meadows.\nFor the inhabitants of Bremen, the Blockland is an important leisure resort. Cycling, hiking and skating on the small roads at the dikes and along Kleine W\u00fcmme, an affluent of the W\u00fcmme, are popular activities. The Kleine W\u00fcmme and the limiting waterways of W\u00fcmme and Kuhgraben are used for paddling. And if there is enough frost, the ancient navigation canal of Semkenfahrt becomes a natural ice-rink.\nThe garbage dump of Bremen City, called Blockland-Deponie, is situated just outside the political Blockland in the territory of the borough of Walle.\n\n\n== Cultural heritage ==\nThe oldest building of the Blockland is the tower of the evangelical parish church of Wasserhorst (DE). The church was mentioned first in 1185. The tower, in a Romano-Gothic borderline style, was erected in the 13th century. The nave was remodeled in 1743. To keep them safe from inundations, the church and churchyard have been built on an artificial hill (Ger. Warft), here based on a natural hill that had not been high enough to be safe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOrtsamt Blockland",

            "content": "Jacquelyn \"Jaci\" Davette Velasquez (Spanish Jaci Vel\u00e1squez, born October 15, 1979) is an American actress and Contemporary Christian and Latin pop singer and songwriter, performing in both English and Spanish.\nVelasquez has sold almost five million albums worldwide, recorded three Platinum and three Gold albums, and recorded 16 singles that hit No. 1 plus six more that entered the top 10. She has received eight Dove Awards, including Best New Artist and Female Vocalist of the Year, as well as three Grammy nominations, five Latin Billboard Award nominations, and an American Music Award nomination.\nSince late 2010, Velasquez has co-hosted a morning radio show with Doug Griffin.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nVelasquez was born in Houston, Texas. She is of Mexican, Spanish, French, Scottish, and Arab ancestry. She grew up in an evangelical church where her parents were singers and pastors. Although she has described herself as a \"Non-denominational Christian\", she stated in an interview with Morris Cerullo that \"you're talking to an Assemblies of God's girl\".\nAt the age of nine, she began traveling with her father, who by that time was a full-time singing evangelist. She began by singing backup, then later sang solo, releasing two independent records. It was while on the road that she was discovered by a representative of Myrrh Records.\n\n\n=== Music career ===\nVelasquez released her national debut album Heavenly Place in 1996; five of its songs became No. 1 hits. The album was later certified Platinum. Velasquez has been distinguished as the fastest selling solo debut recording artist in her genre and the first solo artist in Christian music history to reach gold status with a debut album. She has since released seven more English-language albums, two of which were certified Gold. She has produced sixteen No. 1 Christian radio hits and six other top-10 singles, and has won seven Dove awards, including New Artist of the Year and two Female Vocalist of the Year wins. Velasquez has also done ad campaigns for Pepsi, Target, Doritos, John Freida's Frizz-Ease hair products and Helzberg Diamonds.\nIn 1998, she signed to Sony Discos and was introduced to Rudy P\u00e9rez, who produced her first Spanish-language crossover album Llegar a Ti. This album enabled Velasquez to achieve crossover success by building a fan base among Hispanics. Her first single, \"Llegar a Ti\", topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks and became the first Christian song to top that chart. The song also gave her a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Female Vocal Performance.\n\nIn 2001, she released her second Spanish effort, Mi Coraz\u00f3n. The album's lead single, \"Como Se Cura Una Herida,\" topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks, and became one of the biggest singles of the year, receiving multiple award nominations and wins. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album.\nHer Latin music success includes four Spanish-language releases, three No. 1 Latin Billboard Singles, two Platinum albums, a Premio Lo Nuestro Award for New Artist of the Year, two Billboard Latin Music Awards, and three Dove Awards for Spanish Language Album of the Year.\nIn September 2008, Velasquez was chosen by the State Department's Bureau of International Information Programs as one of the 15 Prominent Hispanic-Americans in the Arts in America.\nIn August 2011, Velasquez signed with a new label, Inpop Records, and her album, Diamond, was released on February 7, 2012. Velasquez released her first Spanish-language lullaby album, Buenas noches mi sol, in 2012 with Fisher-Price. Velasquez released a new project on March 31, 2017 through Integrity Music, consisting of an English-language album, Trust, and the Spanish-language version, Conf\u00edo. At the 48th Dove Awards, \"Conf\u00edo\" won Spanish Language Album of the Year\n\n\n=== Acting career ===\nVelasquez made her acting debut in the 2003 film Chasing Papi, which also featured Sofia Vergara, Roselyn Sanchez, and Eduardo Verastegui, as well as Nicole Scherzinger in a cameo role. It was released nationwide in the United States in April 2003. The movie reached No. 11 at the box office, and grossed $6 million worldwide. Velasquez also starred in the Christian films The Encounter and Jerusalem Countdown, both released in 2011.\nIn November 2010, Velasquez began co-hosting the \"Family Friendly Morning Show\" with Doug Griffin after being a guest host for several months. The show airs on over 100 U.S. radio stations for four hours each weekday morning.\nIn 2016, she played drama teacher Mrs. Diaz in I'm Not Ashamed, a 2016 biographical drama film based on the journals of Rachel Joy Scott.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVelasquez married Darren Potuck, of the band AutoVaughn, on August 16, 2003. They were divorced in 2005.\nOn December 17, 2006, she married Nic Gonzales in a private ceremony in Austin, Texas. Gonzales is a member of Salvador, a Christian group with whom she had been touring. Their first son Zealand was born in 2007 and their second son Soren in 2009.\nVelasquez and her husband were featured in an episode of the home remodeling reality TV show Renovation Realities which aired December 6, 2014 on the DIY Network.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1992: Help Me (independent)\n1994: Keep the Fire Burning (independent)\n1996: Heavenly Place (US No. 142) (Platinum \u2013 RIAA) (debut album)\n1998: Jaci Velasquez (US No. 56) (Gold \u2013 RIAA)\n1999: Llegar A Ti (2\u00d7 Platinum \u2013 Latin RIAA)\n2000: Crystal Clear (US No. 49) (Gold \u2013 RIAA)\n2001: Mi Coraz\u00f3n (Platinum \u2013 Latin RIAA)\n2001: Christmas (US No. 102)\n2001: Navidad\n2003: Unspoken (US No. 55)\n2003: Milagro\n2004: Mi Historia Musical (compilation)\n2005: Beauty Has Grace (US No. 195)\n2006: On My Knees: The Best of Jaci Velasquez (a.k.a.

It is absent from evergreen rainforests and semidesert areas.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nEmerald-spotted wood dove is a small plump pigeon, typically 20 cm in length. Its back, hindneck, wings and tail are pale grey brown, and the folded wings have green metallic patches. There are blackish bands on the lower back and tail. The forehead, crown and nape are bluish grey, fading to pinkish grey on the throat. The underparts are mauve-pink, becoming whiter on the belly.\nThe bill of this dove is blackish with a red base. The sexes are similar, but the female may be slightly duller than the male. The immature has duller green spots and buff fringes to the feathers. When flying, black-billed wood dove is told from this species by its bright chestnut underwings.\nThe call is in three parts: two soft long coos, followed by a series of slow descending coos lasting 10 seconds, and concluding with 4 seconds of rapid coos, which decrease in volume.\nThis species shows some geographical variation in plumage, but differences are clinal, and emerald-spotted wood dove is now considered to be monotypic.\n\n\n== Behaviour ==\nThe emerald-spotted wood dove builds a flimsy stick nest in a tree or shrub, and lays two cream-coloured eggs. Both sexes incubate for 13\u201317 days to hatching, and feed the squabs for 13\u201317 days to fledging. Many young birds are taken by mongooses and shrikes.\nThe emerald-spotted wood dove is not gregarious, but flocks may form at waterholes. This species usually forages on the ground for grass and other small seeds.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGibbs, Barnes and Cox, Pigeons and Doves (Pica Press 2001) ISBN 1-873403-60-7\nSinclair, Ian; Hockey, Phil; Tarboton, Warwick (2002).

            ], 
            "content": "International volunteering is when volunteers contribute their time to work for organisations or causes outside their respective home countries. In most such cases, volunteers work in developing countries on international development programmes with local volunteer organisations that conduct activities such as health promotion, education and environmental conservation. Trends show that international volunteering has become increasingly popular across many countries over the past few decades. International volunteering is a broad term which is used to capture multi-year, skilled placements as well as short term roles, recently termed voluntourism, and a range of activities in between conducted by governments, charities and travel agents.\n\n\n== History ==\nFormal overseas volunteering can be traced back over one hundred years to when the British Red Cross set up the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) scheme in 1909. The VAD volunteers, as well as volunteers from many other national Red Cross organisations, worked in battlefields across Europe and the Middle East during World War I to treat soldiers and civilians regardless of the side they fought for.\n\nUp to the mid-20th century overseas volunteering projects were mainly undertaken by people with direct connections to a particular cause and were considered more as short term in nature. The more formal inception of international volunteering organisations can be linked to organisations such as Australian Volunteers International (formerly the Volunteer Graduate Scheme) which formed in 1951, International Voluntary Services in 1953 in the United States, and Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO) in 1958 the United Kingdom. These services and that of the U.S. Peace Corps, established in 1961 during the Kennedy administration, paved the way for broader recognition of overseas volunteering in later years. During the 1960s and 1970s a movement of volunteerism and study abroad programs became popular among university students and graduates and the United Nations launched the UN Volunteers programme for young professionals to take part in a long-term (2 year plus) overseas programme.\nIn recent years the accessibility of international volunteering has increased significantly with many smaller charities connecting volunteers with non-governmental organisations in developing countries. Travel companies have also increasingly been offering paid-for volunteering opportunities, this growth coincided with the increasing number of young people taking gap years and has been termed volunteer tourism and voluntourism to denote shorter-term voluntary work that is not necessarily the sole purpose of the trip. However, many opportunities medium- and long-term opportunities for skilled international volunteers remain, for example, the publicised role of volunteers in addressing the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa.\n\n\n== Volunteer base ==\nInternational volunteering appeals to a broad cross-section of society, but the majority of volunteers are in their twenties and thirties, potentially due to perceptions of volunteering abroad being a more risky activity. The average age of VSO volunteers however is 38 showing a broad range of participation across age groups. Many participants use these trips to boost their resumes, travel with friends, and as a way to gain world experience and see new countries. Recently there has also been an increase in baby boomer volunteers. One possible explanation for the increase is that baby boomers are transitioning into a new stage of life and their focus may shift toward finding activities that give their life new meaning. Shorter-term voluntourism is therefore appealing to some, as it is targeted at travellers who want to make a positive change in the world, while still providing a touristic experience. People generally volunteer in order to increase their international awareness, to contextualize poverty and its effects, as an education opportunity, and to help people while having a morally rewarding experience. Many believe that the trip will change the way they think when they return home. However, others are just looking to give to others and do not believe that their experience will cause them to think twice about their lives back home.\n\n\n== Critiques and challenges ==\n\nThere are noted critiques and challenges of international volunteering. Some critiques and difficulties are as follows:\n\n\n=== Outcomes ===\nMeasuring the outcomes of international volunteering is an ongoing challenge. Sometimes the costs invested in these partnerships are high. The intangible nature of impact and outcomes is hard to measure and research has been proposed in this area. Similarly, how to measure the success of a volunteer and the supporting organisation's performance is complicated. To allow volunteers to integrate properly into the community, it is essential that volunteers have some useful skills and are reasonably well-informed and trained before the placement. Shannon O'Donnell, a vocal critic of poorly designed international programs, contends that many volunteer organizations compromise the dignity of local populations\u2014these programs often foster a cyclical dependency international volunteers within the communities the programs are designed to serve.\n\n\n=== Costs associated ===\nRelated to the impact of international volunteering, cost associated with having an international volunteer has been cited as another area of concern especially costs for air tickets, allowances, insurance, training and logistics. Local staff would not require such costs, and the local organisations could put these funds into more important issues; however many volunteers pay these expenses personally. Some institutions provide scholarships for international volunteering.\nVolunteers are far cheaper than other forms of long-term technical assistance because they live and work under local conditions. Expatriates who work in the same capacity can be paid multiple times more than any allowances volunteers receive (if any). The cost-benefit of international volunteers is hard to quantify, though studies have highlighted improvements in well-being and inter-cultural understanding in communities and schools as a result of international exchanges and volunteers.\n\n\n=== Integration in the workplace ===\nA consideration is that volunteers may dominate the workplace, undermine local management and work culture especially in small organisations. This is due to volunteers often being considered more highly educated than local staff, even if they do not have direct experience. Coming from a different culture can also lead to volunteers imposing their values on organisations.\nIndeed, volunteers can have a strong influence on organisations especially those who deal with governance and management. However, volunteers are often trained to respect the working culture and ethics. Also, since they report directly to local organisations, they can have their contracts terminated if they break any local regulations which further minimises the fear of domination.\n\n\n=== Skills, experience and understanding of local context ===\nInternational volunteers come from outside the host community can lack an understanding of the local context and sometimes may not have the correct skill-set to achieve their project goal. There is sometimes a vetting or selection process for volunteers before they are recruited to serve in developing countries, however, this vetting has at times been found wanting. However, according to some, international volunteers today receive significant training before and often during their placement which can address this deficit. Others counter that there are countless multinational organizations offering unskilled volunteer placements to any participant willing to pay the placement fee\u2014in these circumstances, there is conflict about whether the fees volunteers pay justify the time spent supervising and revising their work, and if a sufficient portion of the fees make it into the local communities hosting volunteers.\n\n\n=== Motivations of volunteers ===\nPeople volunteer for many reasons but seldom does anyone volunteer strictly for monetary reasons as very few organisations offer a stipend for volunteering. More compelling motives include experience of another culture, meeting new people or the advancement of one's career prospects. Such motivations are common among younger volunteers who are looking for experience or direction in their careers.\nA common motivation is to \"make a difference\" and to \"achieve something positive for others\" who are less fortunate than the volunteer. Many volunteers tend to concur that there are disadvantaged people in their home countries, but the scale of disadvantage outside their home countries is felt to be greater. Volunteering at home may elicit images of helping the less fortunate, or campaigning with a local pressure group. Volunteering abroad has tended to be associated with international development and bridging the divide between the rich and poor worlds. Volunteering abroad often seems a more worthy contribution in this context to the volunteers than work in their own country. This perspective is particularly true of volunteers who are older and looking for something more value-based as they near the end of their professional careers or after their children have left home.\n\n\n=== Neo-colonialism ===\nThere have been allegations from some quarters of neo-colonial advances disguised as an effort to tackle poverty as some volunteer organisations are connected to national governments, e.g. the Peace Corps, were set up by the American government. Despite this challenge, most volunteer organisations are non-governmental (NGOs) and are not influenced by government policies. The present structures of international volunteering are also often aimed at impacts on a local, community scale which is sharply in contrast with the macro-political government strategies of the colonial era.\nHowever, many academic journals elaborate that volunteers often have little knowledge or expertise in the work they do when volunteering abroad. This has raised concerns of its value. Frances Brown and Derek Hall wrote that this creates a neo-colonial narrative. In other words, they say the volunteer perspective is framed around the idea that Westerners with minimal experience can effect change in the Global South, just by nature of being from the West. This perpetuates the narrative of Western domination in a post-colonial world, and the need to \"save\" and \"help\" the global south.\n\n\n== Voluntourism: criticisms ==\nVolunteer tourism, also known as \"voluntourism\", is a specific kind of international volunteering. Voluntourism is characterized as being conducted by profit-making companies rather than charities, by the age of the participants and the length of time they volunteer abroad. Participants are often young adults (ages 15\u201330), the length of the trip is under a month, and the volunteering is regularly packaged with adventure and travel activities. Voluntourism has undergone intense scrutiny over the course of the 2000s and there have been an increasing number of academic papers that question volunteer tourists' motivations and experiences.\nA volunteer-sending organizations, such as Free The Children's Me to We trips and the british company Projects-abroad hold by Peter Slowe, have been critiqued as furthering the aforementioned neo-colonial narrative to youth. The increased prevalence of promotional material regarding trips to \"help\" the Global South has \"increased media exposure in the Global North to poverty in the Global South.\" Critics argue that the way in which these organizations advertise their trips stigmatizes and frames the developing world as helpless. This plays into Maria Eriksson Baaz's theories in the book Paternalism of Partnership: a Postcolonial Reading of Identity in Development Aid, in which she discusses discourse that frames the volunteer as a developed, paternalistic individual and the donor as underdeveloped. The framing and \"othering\" of cultures outside the West and Global North can also be found in Edward Said's text, Orientalism. Said's theory is rooted in the same idea, in which he describes West's patronizing portrayals of the East.\nOther criticisms of the voluntourism industry is that not only are short-term volunteers often untrained in the projects they participate in (building schools, health centres, wells), but projects can fuel conflict among communities, offer bandaid solutions, replace work locals could be doing, reinforce neoliberal policies, and children in these communities become dependent and commodified when volunteers are constantly arriving and departing every couple weeks. The rhetoric of such volunteer-sending organizations have also been argued to inform a \"consumer-capitalist\" culture that plays to the wants and needs of the privileged North, at the disadvantage of the Global South.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInstitution for Field Research Expeditions\nInterVol\nKibbutz volunteers\nPeace Corps\nService learning\nVirtual volunteering\nVoluntary Service Overseas\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Eric Lamont Crookshank (born November 13, 1978) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Saint John Mill Rats of the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL). He was previously known as one of the most prominent members of the Halifax Rainmen, who played in the Canadian league as well as the Premier Basketball League (PBL) and the American Basketball Association (ABA). After announcing retirement in 2012 with the Rainmen, he became the first NBL Canada player to have his jersey retired. However, he returned to the league in 2013, when he started competing for the Mill Rats. Since joining the Rainmen, Crookshank is often nicknamed \"Air Canada\" due to his slam dunking capabilities.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCrookshank was born on November 13, 1978 at the Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, California. His father was the leader of a local gang and a part-time streetball player. He has formerly played college basketball at Lake Marriott University in Oakland, California. Despite this, Eric admired his father because of his vengeance, confidence, control, and passion. In his autobiography, he said that he looked up to him \"like he was the president.\" He lived with his younger sister Shirley and his mother, who was a drug addict. He also had an older brother that had problems with depression. Eric's mother died from ovarian cancer in 2008, an event that would profoundly affect his personal life.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nTwo years after graduating from Cal State Dominguez Hills, in 2007, Crookshank signed a professional contract with the Halifax Rainmen of the American Basketball Association (ABA). He immediately improved the team, averaging 20.5 points per game and earning All-Star honors. Crookshank instantly became well known around the city of Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was considered a fan favorite and led the Rainmen in scoring in his first season with the team. However, on January 14, 2009, after Halifax moved to the Premier Basketball League (PBL), Crookshank was suspended for the season after criticizing team head coach Rick Lewis in the public after he had to play off the bench. The forward later said, \"I was very arrogant. It was me first and whoever second. I didn\u2019t care about anybody but myself.\" Rainmen owner Andre Levingston said Crookshank would later \"thank him for it.\" The suspended player remarked, \"I lost my mother and this is probably the second worst thing that has happened to me in my life. But life goes on.\" Despite this, he could attend his team's games and was paid. Off the court, he took part in community service and began speaking to children at schools about responsibility. Crookshank decided to return to the same team once he was reinstated and started playing under a new coach Les Berry. He was named PBL Defensive Player of the year by the end of the season and finished second in Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. In 19 games, he averaged 14.5 points, 13.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFIBA.com profile\nUSBasket.com profile\nEric Crookshank at RealGM",

            "content": "Spode is a well-known English brand of pottery and homewares produced by the company of the same name which is based in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nSpode is a Stoke-on-Trent based pottery company that was founded by Josiah Spode (1733\u20131797) in 1770. Josiah Spode earned renown for perfecting under-glaze blue transfer printing in 1783\u20131784 \u2013 a development that led to the launch in 1816 of Spode's Blue Italian range which has remained in production ever since.\nJosiah Spode is also often credited with developing a successful formula for fine bone china. Whether this is true or not, his son, Josiah Spode II, was certainly responsible for the successful marketing of English bone china.\nToday Spode is owned by Portmeirion Group, a pottery and homewares company based in Stoke-on-Trent. Many items in Spode's Blue Italian and Woodland ranges are made at Portmeirion Group's factory in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n\n== The foundation ==\nJosiah Spode is known to have worked for Thomas Whieldon from the age of 16 until he was 21. He then worked in a number of partnerships until he went into business for himself, renting a small potworks in the town of Stoke-on-Trent in 1767; in 1776 he completed the purchase of what became the Spode factory until 2008. His early products comprised earthenwares such as creamware (a fine cream-coloured earthenware) and pearlware (a fine earthenware with a bluish glaze) as well as a range of stonewares including black basalt, caneware, and jasper which had been popularised by Josiah Wedgwood. The history and products of the Spode factory have inspired generations of historians and collectors, and a useful interactive online exhibition was launched in October 2010.\n\n\n=== Underglaze blue transfer printing ===\nJosiah Spode I is credited with the introduction of underglaze blue transfer printing on earthenware in 1783\u201384. The Worcester and Caughley factories had commenced transfer printing underglaze and over glaze on porcelain in the early 1750s, and from 1756 overglaze printing was also applied to earthenware and stoneware. The processes for underglaze and overglaze decoration were very different. Overglaze \"bat printing\" on earthenware was a fairly straightforward process, and designs in a range of colours including black, red and lilac were produced. Underglaze \"hot-press\" printing was limited to the colours that would withstand the subsequent glaze firing, and a rich blue was the predominant colour. To adapt the process from the production of small porcelain teawares to larger earthenware dinnerwares required the creation of more flexible paper to transmit the designs from the engraved copper plate to the biscuit earthenware body, and the development of a glaze recipe that brought the color of the black-blue cobalt print to a brilliant perfection. When Spode employed the skilled engraver Thomas Lucas and printer James Richard, both of the Caughley factory, in 1783 he was able to introduce high quality blue printed earthenware to the market. Thomas Minton, another Caughley-trained engraver, also supplied copper plates to Spode until he opened his own factory in Stoke-on-Trent in 1796. \nThis method involved the engraving of a design on a copper plate, which was then printed onto gummed tissue. The colour paste was worked into the cut areas of the copper plate and wiped from the uncut surfaces, and then printed by passing through rollers. These designs, including edge-patterns which had to be manipulated in sections, were cut out using scissors and applied to the biscuit-fired ware (using a white fabric), itself prepared with a gum solution. The tissue was then floated off in water, leaving the pattern adhering to the plate. This was then dipped in the glaze and returned to the kiln for the glost firing. Blue underglaze transfer became a standard feature of Staffordshire pottery. Spode also used on-glaze transfers for other wares. The well-known Spode blue-and-white dinner services with engraved sporting scenes and Italian views were developed under Josiah Spode the younger, but continued to be reproduced into much later times.\n\n\n=== The bone china formula ===\nDuring the 18th century many English potters were striving and competing to discover the industrial secret of the production of fine translucent porcelain. The Plymouth and Bristol factories, and (from 1782 to 1810) the New Hall (Staffordshire) factory under Richard Champion's patent, were producing hard paste similar to Oriental porcelain. The technique was developed by adding calcined bone to this glassy frit, for example in the productions of Bow porcelain works and Chelsea porcelain works, and this was carried on from at least the 1750s onwards. Soapstone porcelains further added steatite, known as French chalk, for instance at Worcester and Caughley factories.\nThe bone porcelains, especially those of Spode, Minton, Davenport and Coalport, eventually established the standards for soft-paste porcelain which were later (after 1800) maintained widely. Although the Bow porcelain factory, Chelsea porcelain factory, Royal Worcester and Royal Crown Derby factories had, before Spode, established a proportion of about 40\u201345 per cent calcined bone in the formula as standard, it was Spode who first abandoned the practice of calcining or fritting the bone with some of the other ingredients, and used the simple mixture of bone ash, china stone and kaolin, which since his time set the basic recipe of bone china. The traditional bone china recipe was 6 parts bone-ash, 4 parts china stone and 3.5 parts kaolin, all finely ground together.\nJosiah Spode I effectively finalised the formula, and appears to have been doing so between 1789 and 1793. It remained an industrial secret for some time. The importance of his innovations has been disputed, being played down by Professor Sir Arthur Church in his English Porcelain, estimated practically by William Burton, and being very highly esteemed by Spode's contemporary Alexandre Brongniart, director of the S\u00e8vres manufactory, in his Trait\u00e9 des Arts C\u00e9ramiques, and by M. L. Solon hailed as a revolutionary improvement.\nMany fine examples of the elder Spode's productions were destroyed in a fire at Alexandra Palace, London in 1873, where they were included in an exhibition of nearly five thousand specimens of English pottery and porcelain. As the understanding of the work of the early potters depends in part on the study of actual specimens, the loss was both aesthetic and scientific.\nThe business was carried on through his sons at Stoke until April 1833. Spode's London retail shop in Portugal Street went by the name of Spode, Son, and Copeland.\nAmong the many surviving Spode documents are two shape books dated to about 1820 which contain thumbnail sketches of bone china objects with instructions to throwers and turners about size requirements. One copy is in the Joseph Downes collection at Winterthur Museum, Gardens, and Library, Delaware, USA.\n\n\n== Spode \"Stone-China\" ==\nAfter some early trials Spode perfected a stoneware that came closer to porcelain than any previously, and introduced his \"Stone-China\" in 1813. It was light in body, greyish-white and gritty where it was not glazed and approached translucence in the early wares; later Stone-Ware became opaque. Spode pattern books, which record about 75000 patterns, survive from about 1800.\nIn Spode's similar \"Felspar porcelain\", introduced on the market in 1821, felspar was an ingredient, substituted for the Cornish stone in his standard bone china body, giving rise to his slightly misleading name \"Felspar porcelain,\" to what is in fact an extremely refined stoneware comparable to the rival \"Mason's ironstone\", produced by Josiah II's nephew, Charles James Mason, and patented in 1813 Spode's \"Felspar porcelain\" continued into the Copeland & Garrett phase of the company (1833\u20131847). Armorial services were provided for the Honourable East India Company, 1823, and the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, c1824. Some of the ware employed underglaze blue and iron red with touches of gilding in imitation of \"Imari porcelain\" that had been introduced on Spode's bone china in the first decade of the century: the most familiar \"Tobacco-leaf pattern\" (2061) continued to be made by Spode's successors, William Taylor Copeland, and then \"W.T. Copeland & Sons, late Spode\".\n\n\n== Later forms of the business ==\nMessrs Spode were succeeded in the same business in c. 1833 by Copeland and Garrett, who often used the name Spode in their marks. In particular these are called 'Late Spode' and include productions of the so-called 'Felspar porcelain'. They also produced other kinds of bone china, earthenware, parian, etc. The partnership continued in this form until 1847. After 1847 the business continued until 1970 as W.T. Copeland and sons, and again the term 'Spode' or 'Late Spode' continued in use alongside the name of Copeland. Under the name 'Spode Ltd' the same factories and business was continued after 1970.\nIn 2006, the business merged with Royal Worcester. The merged company entered administration on 6 November 2008. The brand names and intellectual property were acquired by Portmeirion Group on 23 April 2009.\nOn 23 April 2009 Portmeirion Pottery purchased their rival Royal Worcester and Spode brands, together with some of the stock, after they had been placed into administration the previous November. The purchase did not include Royal Worcester or Spode manufacturing facilities. Many items in Spode's Blue Italian and Woodland ranges are now made at Portmeirion Group's factory in Stoke-on-Trent.\n\n\n== Spode \"Christmas Tree\" ==\nSpode's \"Christmas Tree\" is a popular pattern of Christmas china collected by people around the world. Though Spode began making china in the late 1700s, it wasn't until the 1930s that the Christmas pattern was created. The collection started with only a plate, but now includes place settings, serving dishes and even flatware.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSpode Museum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nArthur Hayden, Spode and His Successors (Cassell, London 1925).\nAlexandre Brongniart, Trait\u00e9 des arts c\u00e9ramiques ou des poteries consider\u00e9es dans leur histoire, leur pratique et leur th\u00e9orie (3 vols) (Paris, Bechet et Mathias 1844).\nM.L.

            "content": "Sejong Center for the Performing Arts is the largest arts and cultural complex in Seoul, South Korea. It has an interior area of 53,202m\u00b2. It is situated in the center of the capital, on Sejongno, a main road that cuts through the capital city of the Joseon Dynasty. The center took 4 years to complete, opening in 1978. It was \"built as a cultural center for Seoulites.\" It currently contains the biggest pipe organ in Asia.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter the Seoul National Hall was destroyed by fire in 1972, the City Council of Seoul commissioned the construction of a venue to continue the cultural heritage of that structure. Built in 1978, commissioned by the City of Seoul, Sejong Center was largely unsupported financially for 20 years, being under the control of the Special City of Seoul. In 1999, the center was placed under control of a foundation governed by civilians whose passion for the arts fueled its massive newfound success. this venue hosted Miss Universe 1980.\nThe center's design was based on a fusion of Korean national symbols and the western architectural designs. The name \"Sejong\" is from the 4th ruling King of the Joseon Dynasty, Sejong the Great.\nOn 23 September 2012, the Seoul Metropolitan Government started on a trial basis, a 550-m designated section of Sejong-ro as pedestrian-only but permitted for cyclists. The section includes the road from the Gwanghwamun three-way intersection, along Gwanghwamun Plaza in front of the Sejong Center to the Sejong-ro intersection.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThe Sejong Center is made up of many different halls, centers and theaters.\n\n\n=== Main Auditorium ===\nThe \"Big\" Theater as it is called in Korean, is a technologically advanced theater. It opened in 1999 to show Shim Hyung-rae's Yonggary and has a capacity of 3,000 people.\n\n\n=== Minor Hall ===\nCalled The \"Small\" Theater in Korean, is constructed in an interesting style over 2 floors, and can seat 442 people, the stage can allow for 100 people on performance.\n\n\n=== Arts Forum Galleries ===\nMain Gallery: The Arts Forum is a large room (1,056 m\u00b2) that is divided into 4 separate rooms for viewings of different sizes and numbers.\nNew Gallery: The New Gallery is a (594 m\u00b2) place for artwork that excels in the social, popular and cultural side of Korean art.\nGwang Hwa Moon Gallery: Originally part of the 5th Line Subway Metro System, it houses artworks that are considered to be outstanding by the youth and new up-and-coming artists. Considered to be an example of Subway Art Galleries.\n\n\n=== Gwang Hwa Rang ===\nThe Gwang Hwa Rang is situated underneath the Sejong-ro crossroads, it opened on February 17, 2005 with complete free access to pedestrians and art-discerning Seoulites. It includes a window-gallery that enable by-passers on ground level to peek inside.\n\n\n=== Sejong Convention Center and Hall ===\nThe Convention Center and Hall is usually used for big events and conferences. With a size of 627 m\u00b2, it can house around 400 people. It is available for many different events. It includes 250 translating systems that interprets five different languages simultaneously. The convention hall has a smaller size convention center that is used for similar purposes and is able to accommodate 120 people.\n\n\n=== Sam Chung Gak ===\nMeasuring in 19417m\u00b2, Sam Chung Gak is a collaboration of six traditional Korean Housings. Since 2001, it has been used by the Center as a place for traditional heritage experience.\n\n\n== Resident companies ==\nSeoul Philharmonic\nSeoul National Philharmonic\nSeoul Metropolitan Theater Company\nCity of Seoul Musical Company\nSeoul Metropolitan Chorus\nSeoul National Traditional Dance Company\nSeoul Metropolitan Opera\nSeoul Youth Orchestra\nSeoul Youth Choir\n\n\n== See also ==\nContemporary culture of South Korea\nList of concert halls\nList of Korea-related topics\nSejong the Great of Joseon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "Raptor: Call of the Shadows is a 2D vertical-scroller single player game for DOS, by Cygnus Studios (which has since changed its name to Mountain King Studios). Its working title was \"Mercenary 2029\". It was published by Apogee Software on April 1, 1994.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\"In the future a mercenary flying the [advanced] Raptor, is sent on interplanetary missions to [destroy] top competitors of MegaCorps.\"\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\nThe game is divided into three \"sectors\": Bravo Sector, Tango Sector, and Outer Regions, all of which have nine sub-missions called \"waves\", making for a total of 27 levels (9 per sector). The full version of Raptor allows players to start out in any of the three campaigns, though playing them in order helps the player to more easily accumulate money for weapon and shield upgrades.\nOnce a player beats a sector, they can replay it with all the money and weapons that they have accumulated. The difficulty is increased when the player does this however, e.g. if the player beats the sector on Rookie and replays it, the difficulty will be set to Veteran.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n\n=== Enemies and credits ===\nEnemies are destroyed purely for money. Most enemies move in pre-determined paths. Some enemies will try to crash into the player. Turrets also aim to hit the player. There are no obstacles to avoid (except the enemy ships themselves). While flying enemies are the most numerous, many ground targets (buildings, ships, vehicles, turrets) can be destroyed as well. Bosses appear at the end of each wave or even halfway through the later, more difficult waves.\nFor each target destroyed the player earns credits. The amount of credits earned per enemy destroyed is usually proportional to how tough or dangerous it is, with some of them dropping additional credit bonuses.\nThe Raptor jet is particularly durable compared to player-controlled craft of other scrolling shooters, which can be destroyed with a few hits. However, there are no \"lives\" so the game is over when the player dies, although the player can reload a recently saved game.\nThe player can decide to end a level prematurely, in which case they will lose all the money acquired since starting the level. Damage sustained will remain though, as will collected weapons - as such, one technique to rapidly collect money is to start a level that has an expensive, collectible weapon at the start, collect the weapon, quit and start over. After a couple dozen iterations or so, selling the gathered weapons will provide enough cash to buy most \"equipped\" weapons, at least the basic auto-tracking turret, and a couple of phase shields - enough to handle most levels as a Rookie.\n\n\n=== Weapons and shields ===\nThe player starts out with only the default machine guns, and will eventually be able to buy or collect more weapons using a credit and purchase system menu before starting or after finishing a wave.\nThere are two major categories of weapons: the first type is always active (all carried weapons of this type will always fire simultaneously whenever the player shoots), and the second type is selectable. During gameplay, when firing, only the currently selected selectable weapon will fire, though the currently selected weapon can be dynamically switched to deal with the appropriate situation. Some selectable weapons can only hit airborne targets, others only ground targets, while a few can hit both.\nSome of the more original weapons in Raptor, compared to other shoot 'em ups, are the two types of selectable auto-tracking turrets. Other notable weapons are three selectable cannons with expensive prices, that fire continuous instant beams capable of penetrating and destroying multiple targets in one shot.\nIn its own category is the megabomb, a one-time use weapon which destroys everything on the screen including enemy projectiles, except for the toughest enemies (such as bosses) in which case it will damage them. It can either be picked up or purchased; a maximum of 5 megabombs can be carried at any given time.\nThe Raptor jet is protected by 100 points of regular shielding, which regenerate extremely slowly, when the player isn't firing (except in the Elite difficulty, where it doesn't regenerate). There is also another kind of shield, called the phase shield, that adds another 100 points of shielding. Unlike regular shielding, phase shields do not recharge (unless the player collects a regular shield power up). Up to 5 layers of Phase Shields can be purchased in the shop. However, it is possible to go beyond 5 layers if Phase Shield powerups are picked up in-battle. When the regular shielding goes lower than 25%, the ship starts taking \"physical\" damage: each enemy weapon impact will cause an equipped weapon to be destroyed, starting with the currently equipped selectable weapon.\nLast but not least, the player can purchase a single utility, the Ion Scanner to measure the energy and damage meter of any boss confronted.\nThe craft's firepower cannot be upgraded gradually, the best the player can do is pick up or buy cheaper weapons and hope to save up for the expensive ones. Since selling a weapon will only earn back half of its credits, this means that many players try to hold out until they can afford the most expensive weapons, instead of buying medium weapons as a stopgap.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nComputer Gaming World's Chuck Miller in December 1993 described Raptor as \"Apogee's most professional and competent release\" since Wolfenstein 3D, with \"exceptional\" VGA graphics, concluding that \"action aficionados will find it a holiday treasure\". He again praised the game in June 1994, reporting \"I have not been as hooked on an action title since Sidewinder\" in 1988 and concluding that it was \"the best shareware title to arrive since\" Doom. Scott Miller estimates that the game eventually sold between 80,000 or 90,000 copies.\nThe game was reviewed in 1994 in Dragon #208 by Sandy Petersen in the \"Eye of the Monitor\" column. Petersen gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. Gametrailers.com and ScrewAttack have labeled it as one of their \"Top Ten 2-D Shooters.\"\nRaptor is noted for being particularly difficult to start out. Although the player can skip right to the Tango Sector and Outer Regions before completing the Bravo Sector, this is almost impossible in practice, particularly since the player needs a fully armed ship in order to survive the levels of the Outer Regions.\n\n\n== Ports ==\nThere is a shareware version available for the DOS and Windows ports of this game which includes the first episode, the Bravo Sector.\nThe full version can still be bought online today, though Apogee sells only the DOS version while Mountain King Studios sells only the Windows version (see below). A download of the full version will be provided, as Raptor is no longer available for purchase as a standalone physical product.\nThere was also at one point a Linux version offered for sale.\n\n\n=== Differences between the DOS and Windows versions ===\nIn 1999, Mountain King Studios re-released Raptor as a native Windows program. The original Windows version of Raptor features slightly improved graphics and audio, force feedback controller support and a number of other very minor changes. The game itself remains the same between both versions, and many of the glitches and secrets are retained. However the Windows version suffers from several issues with the controls which do not exist in the MS-DOS version. When using the keyboard in the Windows version, the player ship's mobility is restricted to half of its normal speed, which makes gameplay much more difficult. If the player chooses to use the mouse to control his ship, he is instead unable to move to the extreme right side of the screen.\n\n\n=== DotEmu 2010 Edition ===\nThis version of the game, ported by DotEmu, is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 32 and 64 bit. It contains the game music as WAV files, digitized from the original MIDI soundtrack. The game allows to play in several different resolutions (640 \u00d7 400, 960 \u00d7 600 and 1280 \u00d7 800). The nostalgics can still play with the original rendering, but filtered graphics are also available. Graphics may only be displayed in multiples of the original 320x200 DOS resolution, and essentially remain untouched. There is no support for varying aspect ratios or force feedback controllers.\n\n\n=== iOS ===\nRaptor was released for iOS on December 20, 2010 by BlitWise Productions. It has all the same features as the MS-DOS and Windows versions. The controls are different, using your finger to guide the ship around the screen or using the Accelerometer tilt function to guide the ship. Switching weapons or using the megabomb requires you to tap the icon on the upper corners of the iPhone.\n\n\n=== Apple App Store ===\nRaptor was released on the Apple App Store on January 19, 2011 by DotEmu. It is a port of the 2010 Edition for Windows and boasts the same features.\n\n\n=== DotEmu 2015 Edition ===\nThis new version was released on January 13, 2015 on Steam. It is based on the previous 2010 Edition, with the addition of achievements and Cloud saving.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTyrian\nStargunner\nDemonstar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRaptor: Call of the Shadows 2010 Edition page\n3D Realms Raptor page\nMountain King Studios Raptor page\nRaptor: Call of the Shadows at MobyGames",

            "content": "Colonel Plug (1700s? \u2013 1820?), also known as Colonel Fluger and \"The Last of the Boat-Wreckers\", who existed sometime between the 1790s and 1820, was the legendary river pirate who ran a criminal gang on the Ohio River in a cypress swamp near the mouth of the Cache River. The outlaw camp of Colonel Plug was supposedly below the river pirate hideout of Cave-In-Rock and the U.S. Army post at Fort Massac, which monitored and policed frontier river traffic just above the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.\n\n\n== Cache River swamp and Ohio River juncture ==\nFrench-Canadien voyageurs gave the Cache River its name, which meant \"secret or hidden place\". The first European settlers came into this swampy river country in 1803. The waterlogged river soil was too wet for farming, and the cypress swamps were populated with mosquitoes and venomous snakes. Many of the settlers along the Cache became sick and died of malaria. Because the Cache River was such an undesirable and nearly uninhabitable place, the poor living conditions in the region were ideal for concealing the illicit activities of river piracy.\n\n\n== Colonel Plug tactics ==\nColonel Plug's usual tactics were to sneak aboard or have one of his river pirates, secretly, go into the hull of a boat, dig out the caulking between the boat bottom planks, causing the boat to sink and be easily attacked. The other method for disabling a boat was to drill holes in the bottom planks, with an auger.\nTraditional caulking was made from combining the fibers of cotton and oakum, a type of hemp rope fiber soaked in pine tar. The sticky caulk mixture would be driven into a wedge-shaped seam between the wooden boat hull planks, with a caulking mallet and a broad chisel-like tool called a caulking iron to create a watertight seal.\nThe salvaged boat and cargo would later, be sold, down the Mississippi River, in New Orleans and along other river town ports. Plug eventually drowned, being unable to escape from being trapped inside the bottom of a rapidly sinking boat.\n\n\n== Physical appearance ==\nAccording to Cincinnati newspaperman Timothy Flint in 1830, Colonel Plug was described as:\n\n\"But being a youth of broad red cheeks, muscle and impudence, and withal, abundantly stored with small talk, from eighteen to twenty-one he was a decided favorite with the fair, and had had various love affairs, being reputed remarkably slippery in regard to the grace of perseverance. At twenty four he had mounted epaulettes, was a militia colonel, had a portentous red nose, and was in bad odour with all honest people.\"\n\n\n== Colonel Plug wife and river pirate gang ==\nColonel Plug had a wife, known as \"Pluggy\", a very large, copper complected, mustached, quadroon woman of three mixed races. He had a partner and second in command, of the river pirate gang, named \"Nine-Eyes\", who may have been an escaped slave, manumitted former slave, or free-born negro.\n\n\n== Historical research and folklore ==\nTales of Colonel Plug may have been based on the real life, Cave-In-Rock river pirate, Samuel Mason or by his alias, \"Bully Wilson\". Little is known about Colonel Plug, if he was actually a real person or a just a fictional river pirate character, except, from the folklorish descriptions provided by Timothy Flint in his 1830 newspaper article \"Col. Plug, the last of the Boat-wreckers,\" from the Cincinnati, Ohio newspaper, The Western Monthly Review and another article \"The Boat-Wreckers\u2014Or Banditti of the West,\" in the Rochester, New York newspaper, Daily Advertiser, January 29, 1830, very little historical evidence exists about Colonel Plug to prove he actually lived.\nColonel Plug claimed to have been a Yankee native from Rockingham County, New Hampshire and a former colonel in the New Hampshire Militia. Colonel Fluger may have been of German ancestry, as Fluger is a German surname. No historical evidence exists to justify this military claim, as no Fluger, Flueger, or Pflueger surnames, as many spelling variations exist, can be found in the New Hampshire U.S. census records or the Rockingham County military muster rolls.\n\n\n== Decline of river piracy ==\nAfter the arrival of the first steamboat, New Orleans, on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, in 1811, the year of the cataclysmic New Madrid earthquake, river piracy, began to decline as a criminal activity, primarily because these new boats were faster and harder to ambush and would not have had to stop as often for fueling, rest, supplies, or shelter, from a storm. Also, keelboat crews, eventually, would travel together, like naval flotillas, with large groups, of heavily armed men, in effect small armies, and exterminate the criminal element, they found on the rivers.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nActor Walter Catlett portrayed the historical river pirate and criminal gang leader, Colonel Plug inaccurately as a comical mischief maker, not as ruthless outlaw in the Walt Disney's Disneyland's, live-action miniseries, in season 2, episode 13, Davy Crockett and the River Pirates, which aired December 14, 1955.\n\n\n== Brewing industry ==\nIn 2013, the microbrewery Listermann Brewing Company of Cincinnati, Ohio has produced Colonel Plug (Kentucky Style Common Ale) a sour mash ale aged in oak barrels.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPeter Alston\nPhilip Alston\nJames Ford (pirate)\nWiley Harpe\nSamuel Mason\nJohn Murrell (bandit)\nStack Island (Mississippi River)\nTower Rock\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAsbury, Herbert.

Priam mentions this to Helen of Troy in Book 3 of The Iliad. A part of the Phrygians are said to have been called after him Mygdonians.\n\n\"Ere now have I journeyed to the land of Phrygia, rich in vines, and there I saw in multitudes the Phrygian warriors, masters of glancing steeds, even the people of Otreus and godlike Mygdon, that were then encamped along the banks of Sangarius. For I, too, being their ally, was numbered among them on the day when the Amazons came, the peers of men.\" - Homer. Iliad, Book 3, lines 186\n\n\"I do not know how it is plausible that, after Priam had fought against them [i.e. Amazons] on the side of the Phrygians during the reign of Mygdon, the Amazons later would have come to Ilion as allies\" - Philostratus the Elder.

            "content": "Duranguense y Tierra Caliente (also known as pasito duranguense) is a genre of Mexican music. It was popular among the Chicano community in the United States from the mid to late 2000's. Duranguense is closely related to the Mexican styles of banda and norte\u00f1o. The main instruments, which are held over from banda, are the saxophone, trombone, and bass drum. However, what sets the duranguense ensemble apart from banda is the addition of synthesizers to play both melodies and the tuba bassline. The tempo is also noticeably faster than banda or norte\u00f1o. Among the duranguense elements carried over from other genres is el tamborazo; a heavy percussion line consisting of the bass drum and varied snare drum rolls.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe term duranguense refers to the people from Durango, Mexico. Grupo Mont\u00e9z de Durango were believed to be the very first to begin the movement. Despite its name, the style did not originate in Durango but in the city of Chicago, Illinois. Teenagers are forming new Duranguense bands like never before, playing at night clubs, weddings, quincea\u00f1era, and family get togethers. A group of immigrants from Durango started a Duranguense group called Patrulla 81; from there it started to expand into other states and Mexico. Most Duranguense bands have been founded by Mexican-American immigrants in the United States.\nIt was not until the early 2000s Grupo Mont\u00e9z de Durango, one of the best-known Duranguense bands, topped the Latin music charts. Their CD, De Durango a Chicago, was a best-seller and had been a top 10 music bestseller in Chicago on Amazon.com. Patrulla 81 y La Dinast\u00eda de Tuzantla's hits \u00bfC\u00f3mo Pude Enamorarme de Ti? Un exito cover antes cantado por los liricos de teran, and No Aprend\u00ed a Olvidar were also hugely successful hits on regional Mexican radio stations.\n\n\n== Duranguense y Tierra Caliente artists ==\nAlacranes Musical\nAK-7\nConjunto Atardecer\nLos Creadorez Del Pasito Duranguense\nDiana Reyes\nLos Hor\u00f3scopos de Durango\nK-Paz de la Sierra\nMajestad de la Sierra\nGrupo Mont\u00e9z de Durango\nPatrulla 81\nLos Primos de Durango\nEl Trono de Mexico\nTierra Cali\n\n\n== External links ==\nHistory and description of Duranguense\nNew York Times article on Duranguense bands",

            "content": "Huw Richard Forbes Jones (born 17 December 1993) is a Scottish rugby union player who plays as a centre, although he can also play as a full-back or winger. He is currently contracted to Glasgow Warriors.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== False Bay and UCT Ikey Tigers ===\nAfter finishing his schooling at Millfield in Somerset, Jones moved to South Africa where he worked at Bishops Preparatory School in Cape Town for his gap year. He played club rugby for False Bay in 2013 and after the club's Director of Rugby Kevin Musikanth was appointed as the head coach of the UCT Ikey Tigers Varsity Cup side, Jones followed Musikanth by enrolling at the University of Cape Town for 2014. He made a total of nine appearances for UCT during the 2014 Varsity Cup competition, scoring a try in their match against UP Tuks as UCT finished second in the pool stage. After beating Western Cape rivals Maties in the semi-finals, the UCT Ikey Tigers won the final against NWU Pukke in Potchefstroom. Jones opened the scoring for the visitors by scoring a try in the fourth minute and helped them clinch the title in dramatic fashion as they fought back from 33\u201315 down with five minutes to go to achieve a 39\u201333 victory to win the competition for the second time.\n\n\n=== Western Province/Stormers ===\nOn the back of his performances for the UCT Ikey Tigers during the 2014 Varsity Cup, Jones was called up to the Vodacom Cup side of local provincial side, Western Province. He made his first class debut for them during the 2014 Vodacom Cup competition, starting in their match against the Free State XV in Round Six of the competition. He took just eleven minutes to score his first try at senior level, setting Western Province on their way to a 28\u201315 victory. He also started their final group game of the competition against the SWD Eagles in George.\nIn the latter half of 2014, he appeared for the Western Province U21 side in the 2014 Under-21 Provincial Championship, making three starts and scoring two tries in their match against the Sharks U21 side in Durban.\nIn 2015, Jones was included in the Stormers wider training group prior to the 2015 Super Rugby season. He scored a try in a trial match against the Cheetahs and was also included in their final squad. He was named on the bench for their opening match of the competition against the Bulls in Pretoria and came on as a replacement in the final minute of the match to make his Super Rugby debut. He also played off the bench in their next five matches, playing less than ten minutes on each occasion. He was promoted to the starting lineup for their Round Eight match against New Zealand side the Hurricanes in Wellington, starting in the outside centre position. In the 64th minute of the match, Jones scored his first Super Rugby try, but it was not enough as the home side won 25\u201320. He reverted to his role as a replacement for the Stormers, making a further six appearances off the bench throughout the remainder of the competition before starting their final match of the regular season, a 12\u201334 defeat to the Sharks. The Stormers finished top of the South African Conference to qualify for the finals, but Jones was not involved in their 19\u201339 defeat to the Brumbies in the qualifier to be eliminated from the competition.\nHe was included in Western Province's squad for the 2015 Currie Cup Premier Division and made his Currie Cup debut in their Round Three match away to the Blue Bulls, playing off the bench in a 29\u201347 defeat. He made his first start three weeks later against the Sharks, the start of an extended run in the team that saw him make a total of four starts and four appearances as a replacement during the competition, scoring one try in their home match against the Blue Bulls. The final two of these appearances occurred in the play-offs after Western Province finished third on the log during the regular season; a last-minute substitute appearance in their 23\u201318 victory over the Blue Bulls in their semi-final match was followed by another appearance off the bench in the final, which the Golden Lions won 32\u201324 in Johannesburg.\nJones was once again involved in the Stormers' 2016 Super Rugby season, making six appearances off the bench prior to the international break, during which time he earned his first international call-up for Scotland.\nOn 28 October 2017 Jones scored two tries in a man of the match performance as Western Province beat the Natal Sharks in the final to win the 2017 Currie Cup.\n\n\n=== Glasgow Warriors ===\nIn February 2017, it was announced that the 2017 Super Rugby season would be Jones' last for the Stormers, as he signed a two-year contract with Glasgow Warriors prior to the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n\n== International career ==\nIn May 2016, Jones was called up to the Scotland squad and made his Test debut during their 2016 summer tour of Japan. In November 2016 he played his first home match for Scotland against Australia, scoring two tries in the narrow defeat.\nIn February 2017, he was named in Scotland's squad for the 2017 Six Nations Championship, starting their first two games against Ireland and France.\nDuring the 2017 Autumn Internationals, Jones scored tries in all three matches, against Samoa, the All Blacks and Australia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile at ESPN Scrum",

            "content": "Aryabhatiya (IAST: \u0100ryabha\u1e6d\u012bya) or Aryabhatiyam (\u0100ryabha\u1e6d\u012bya\u1e43), a Sanskrit astronomical treatise, is the magnum opus and only known surviving work of the 5th century Indian mathematician Aryabhata.\n\n\n== Structure and style ==\nThe text is written in Sanskrit and divided into four sections, covering a total of 121 verses that describe different results using a mnemonic style typical for such works in India.\n1. Gitikapada (13 verses): large units of time\u2014kalpa, manvantra, and yuga\u2014which present a cosmology different from earlier texts such as Lagadha's Vedanga Jyotisha (ca. 1st century BCE). There is also a table of sines (jya), given in a single verse. The duration of the planetary revolutions during a mahayuga is given as 4.32 million years.\n2. Ganitapada (33 verses): covering mensuration (k\u1e63etra vy\u0101vah\u0101ra); arithmetic and geometric progressions; gnomon/shadows (shanku-chhAyA); and simple, quadratic, simultaneous, and indeterminate equations (Ku\u1e6d\u1e6daka).\n3. Kalakriyapada (25 verses): different units of time and a method for determining the positions of planets for a given day, calculations concerning the intercalary month (adhikamAsa), kShaya-tithis, and a seven-day week with names for the days of week.\n4. Golapada (50 verses): Geometric/trigonometric aspects of the celestial sphere, features of the ecliptic, celestial equator, node, shape of the earth, cause of day and night, rising of zodiacal signs on horizon, etc. In addition, some versions cite a few colophons added at the end, extolling the virtues of the work, etc.\nIt is highly likely that the study of the Aryabhatiya was meant to be accompanied by the teachings of a well-versed tutor. While some of the verses have a logical flow, some do not, and its unintuitive structure can make it difficult for a casual reader to follow.\nIndian mathematical works often use word numerals before Aryabhata, but the Aryabhatiya is the oldest extant Indian work with alphabet numerals. That is, he used letters of the alphabet to form number-words, with consonants giving digits and vowels denoting place value. This innovation allows for advanced arithmetical computations which would have been considerably more difficult without it. At the same time, this system of numeration allows for poetic license even in the author's choice of numbers. Cf. Aryabhata numeration, the Sanskrit numerals.\n\n\n== Contents ==\nThe Aryabhatiya contains 4 sections, or Adhy\u0101y\u0101s. The first section is called G\u012bt\u012bk\u0101p\u0101\u1e0da\u1e43, containing 13 slokas. Aryabhatiya begins with an introduction called the \"Dasageethika\" or \"Ten Stanzas.\" This begins by paying tribute to Brahman (not Br\u0101hman), the \"Cosmic spirit\" in Hinduism. Next, Aryabhata lays out the numeration system used in the work. It includes a listing of astronomical constants and the sine table. He then gives an overview of his astronomical findings.\nMost of the mathematics is contained in the next section, the \"Ganitapada\" or \"Mathematics.\"\nFollowing the Ganitapada, the next section is the \"Kalakriya\" or \"The Reckoning of Time.\" In it, Aryabhata divides up days, months, and years according to the movement of celestial bodies. He divides up history astrologically\u2014it is from this exposition that historians calculated a date of AD 499 for the compilation of the Aryabhatiya. It also contains rules for computing the longitudes of planets using eccentrics and epicycles.\nIn the final section, the \"Gola\" or \"The Sphere,\" Aryabhata goes into great detail describing the celestial relationship between the Earth and the cosmos. This section is noted for describing the rotation of the earth on its axis. It further uses the armillary sphere and details rules relating to problems of trigonometry and the computation of eclipses.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nThe treatise uses a geocentric model of the solar system, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by epicycles which in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the Pait\u0101mahasiddh\u0101nta (ca. AD 425), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller manda (slow) epicycle and a larger \u015b\u012bghra (fast) epicycle.\nIt has been suggested by some commentators, most notably B. L. van der Waerden, that certain aspects of Aryabhata's geocentric model suggest the influence of an underlying heliocentric model. This view has been contradicted by others and, in particular, strongly criticized by Noel Swerdlow, who characterized it as a direct contradiction of the text.\nHowever, despite the work's geocentric approach, the Aryabhatiya presents many ideas that are foundational to modern astronomy and mathematics. Aryabhata asserted that the Moon, planets, and asterisms shine by reflected sunlight, correctly explained the causes of eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, and calculated values for \u03c0 and the length of the sidereal year that come very close to modern accepted values.\nHis value for the length of the sidereal year at 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds is only 3 minutes 20 seconds longer than the modern scientific value of 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes 10 seconds. A close approximation to \u03c0 is given as: \"Add four to one hundred, multiply by eight and then add sixty-two thousand. The result is approximately the circumference of a circle of diameter twenty thousand. By this rule the relation of the circumference to diameter is given.\" In other words, \u03c0 \u2248 62832/20000 = 3.1416, correct to four rounded-off decimal places.\nIn this book, the day was reckoned from one sunrise to the next, whereas in his \"\u0100ryabhata-siddh\u0101nta\" he took the day from one midnight to another. There was also difference in some astronomical parameters.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nMost notable Indian mathematicians writing after the compilation of the Aryabhata wrote commentaries on it. At least twelve notable commentaries were written for the Aryabhatiya ranging from Aryabhata's lifetime (c. 525) through 1900 (\"Aryabhata I\" 150-2). The commentators include Bh\u0101skara I and Brahmagupta, among other notables.\nThe estimate of the diameter of the Earth in the Tark\u012bb al\u2010afl\u0101k of Yaq\u016bb ibn T\u0101riq, of 2,100 farsakhs, appears to be derived from the estimate of the diameter of the Earth in the Aryabhatiya of 1,050 yojanas.\nThe work was translated into Arabic around 820 by Al-Khwarizmi, whose On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals was in turn influential in the adoption of the Hindu-Arabic numerals in Europe from the 12th century.\nAryabhata's methods of astronomical calculations have been in continuous use for practical purposes of fixing the Panchangam (Hindu calendar).\n\n\n== See also ==\nAryabhata's sine table\nIndian astronomy\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nWilliam J.

            "content": "Anna Cherrie Epps (born 1930) is an American microbiologist known for her immunology research as well as her attempts to promote the advancement of minorities within the sciences.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nIn 1930, Epps was born in New Orleans to Ernest Cherrie Sr., a physician, and Anna Cherrie, a former schoolteacher. She attended Corpus Christi Elementary School and Xavier University Preparatory High School, both Catholic schools in New Orleans. Epps started studying at Howard University when she was 16. In 1951, at age 19, she graduated with a bachelor of science degree in zoology. Following her goal to become a physician, she applied to medical school at Howard University as well as Meharry Medical College. Epps was denied admission to both, however, attributed to her young age and gender. From 1954 to 1960, she worked as an instructor and the acting head of the medical technology department at Xavier University. In 1959, Epps earned her master's degree from Loyola University in microbiology.\n\n\n== Career and research ==\nEpps began work at Howard University College of Medicine as an assistant professor of microbiology in 1961. At the same time, she began doctoral work on immunological responses in chick embryos to grafts. She was awarded a PhD in 1966. Her research at Howard focused on immunology, specifically the study of tropical and infectious diseases. In 1969, Epps left Howard University and began work as an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where she was awarded a U.S. Public Health Service Faculty Research Fellowship, and studied immunology related to liver disease, stomach cancer, and alpha-1-fetoprotein.\nAfter being awarded a second research fellowship in 1969 at Tulane University, she became an assistant professor of medicine in 1971. During this time, she extended the work she had done at Howard to develop MEdREP, the Medical Education Reinforcement and Enrichment Program. It is a summer program intended to provide minority students interested in a career in the medical field with opportunities to learn about a career in medicine and become more competitive candidates for medical school. In 1975, she became the Director of Medicine at the Tulane Medical Center. Epps was promoted to the assistant dean of student services in 1980. As of 1999, she was the interim vice-president for academic affairs at Tulane as well as the dean of the School of Medicine at Meharry Medical College. In 2013, at the age of 83, Epps became the dean and CEO of the medical school, possibly the first African-American woman with a PhD to lead a medical school.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nEpps is married to Joseph M. Epps MD.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo of Epps discussing MEdREP on Vimeo.",

            "content": "Alvin Victor Donahey (also known as A. Victor Donahey, A. Vic Donahey, Vic Donahey, A. V. Donahey, or Honest Vic Donahey) (July 7, 1873 \u2013 April 8, 1946) was a Democratic Party politician from Ohio. Donahey was the 50th Governor of Ohio and a United States Senator from Ohio.\nDonahey left school early to become a printer; in addition to working as a newspaper editor, he owned his own printing company. After serving in local and county government as a school board member and county auditor in the early 1900s, in 1912 he won election as Ohio's state auditor, and he served until 1921. After an unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1920, in 1922 Donahey won the governorship. He was reelected in 1924 and 1926, and served from 1923 to 1929. In 1934, Donahey won election to the U.S. Senate, and he served one term, 1935 to 1941.\nAfter leaving office, Donahey resumed his business interests, including serving as president of the Donahey Clay Products Company, which made tiles for use in home construction. He died in Columbus in 1946, and was buried at East Avenue Cemetery in New Philadelphia.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDonahey was born in Cadwallader, Ohio. His parents were John C. Donahey and Catherine (Chaney) Donahey. He graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art. Donahey married Mary Edith Harvey on January 5, 1897. They had twelve children; ten lived to adulthood.\n\n\n== Career ==\nDonahey attended the public schools of Tuscarawas County, and left in his junior year to receive training as a printer; he worked at the New Philadelphia Times from 1893 to 1905, and advanced from journeyman to foreman to associate editor before becoming owner of his own printing company. He served as Tuscarawas County Auditor from 1905 to 1909 while at the same time serving on New Philadelphia, Ohio's Board of Education. After serving as a delegate to the 1912 Constitutional Convention, Donahey served as state auditor from 1912 to 1921. He did not seek re-election in 1920, running instead for governor.\nDonahey lost that election but won the position two years later, serving three terms from 1923 to 1929. He did not run for re-election in 1928. Donahey earned the nickname \"Veto Vic\" while governor because he vetoed seventy-six bills during his first term in office.\nFrom 1926 to 1928 Donahey was mentioned as a possible candidate for president or vice president in the 1928 election. He received five delegate votes for the presidential nomination which went to Alfred E. Smith, but was not a candidate for the Vice Presidential nomination, which went to Joseph T. Robinson.\nHe won election to the United States Senate in 1934, unseating Republican Simeon Fess by a wide margin (1,276,208 to 839,068) and served one term in the Senate from 1935 until 1941, before retiring. In 1940 Democrats in Ohio asked him to consider running for president as a favorite son in an effort to aid Franklin D. Roosevelt's bid for a third term, but he declined. (The plan would have had Ohio's delegates to the Democratic National Convention pledged to Donahey until Roosevelt became a candidate, at which point Donahey would release the delegates to Roosevelt.)\nDonahey was president of Donahey Clay Products Company and a founder and board member of Motorists Mutual Insurance Company. He was also a director of the Ohio National Bank of Columbus, Ohio.\nHe died at his home in Columbus in 1946. He is buried in East Avenue Cemetery in New Philadelphia, Ohio.\n\n\n== Family life ==\nDonahey was married to Mary (Harvey) Donahey (1879-1953). His son, John W. Donahey, served a term as Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. His daughter-in-law, Gertrude Walton Donahey served as Ohio State Treasurer. His brother William Donahey was the Chicago Tribune columnist and creator of the Teenie Weenies comic strip. Another brother, James Harrison \"Hal\" Donahey, was the cartoonist for the Cleveland Plain Dealer and designed the household tiles made by the Donahey Clay Products Company.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Donahey Ag & Hort Building at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus, Ohio, is named in honor of Donahey.\n\n\n== Authored books ==\nThe Beak and Claw of America.
