            "content": "The Great Man Votes is a 1939 American drama film starring John Barrymore as a widowed professor turned drunkard who has the deciding vote in an election for mayor. It was based on the short story of the same name by Gordon Malherbe Hillman published in the November 1933 issue of American Magazine. The plot of the 2008 movie Swing Vote has been compared to The Great Man Votes.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIvy League scholar Gregory Vance descends into an alcoholic abyss after the death of his wife. He ends up barely able to hold a job, and a night watchman's job at that.\nVance's two children, Joan and Donald, are exceptionally intelligent and benefit from his tutoring. But they are bullied at school by other students and their father risks losing custody of them if he cannot change his ways. New teacher Agnes Billow is able to help Vance become more like the man he used to be, particularly after a political bigwig tempts him ethically with a bribe of a better job in exchange for Vance's vote.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe film recorded a loss of $10,000.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Great Man Votes at the TCM Movie Database\nThe Great Man Votes at AllMovie\nThe Great Man Votes on IMDb",

He opened the first official Academy of Painting on the territory of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci after the artistic and cultural reforms were commenced under the auspices and blessing of Vikentije Jovanovi\u0107, his predecessor.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nArsenije was born in 1698, and had a younger brother, Andrija, who was a priest and a sister who married knez Atanasije Ra\u0161kovi\u0107. Arsenije was consecrated bishop in 1722, a very young age, appointed the Metropolitan of Ra\u0161ka. Arsenije succeeded Serbian Patriarch Mojsije I (s. 1712\u20131725) upon his retirement due to old age, and was enthroned as Arsenije IV by Mojsije on February 18/29, 1725 in Pe\u0107.\nArsenije continued the policies of his predecessors. He traveled extensively and negotiated with the Austrians in order to liberate his people from Ottoman rule. When the Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718) broke out, the Serbs revolted. The Ottomans wanted to capture and kill Patriarch Arsenije IV, but he escaped. After the Austrians were defeated, Arsenije escaped to Austria along with many other refugees. After the peace treaty was signed the Ottomans retained the city of Belgrade, and the territories of what is today Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. The Ottoman Porte selected and appointed a new patriarch at the Serbian Patriarchal seat in Pe\u0107, the Greek Joannicius, from their trusted Phanariotes.\nThe Austrian government continued to recognize Arsenije IV as the Serbian Patriarch and gave him administrative authority of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, the church body of the Habsburg Serbs, a position in which he had difficulties maintaining Serb privileges.\n\n\n== Treaty of Belgrade ==\nWith the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade which ended the Austro-Turkish War (1737\u20131739), the Kingdom of Serbia ceased to exist. The Ottoman sultan deposed the pro-Serbian Patriarch of Pe\u0107 Arsenije IV and in his place appointed the Greek Joannicius, who took the title of Archbishop of Pe\u0107 and Patriarch of the Serbs. The entry of Patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanovi\u0107 into Belgrade was symbolic of many things in the minds of simple folk (the transformation of man into an ideal, into an example, etc.). The entry celebrated the long-awaited arrival of Arsenije IV, the Patriarch of Pe\u0107, into Belgrade to take up the position of spiritual leader of the Orthodox faithful in Austria.\nArsenije IV commissioned Pavle Nenadovi\u0107, a clergyman and poet from the town of Karlovci, to compose a heraldic handbook, Stemmatographia (meaning \"the drawing of ancestry\" in Greek). This heraldic album was modelled after a book of the same title on Slavonic heraldic bearings, engraved in 1701 by Croatian poet Pavao Ritter Vitezovi\u0107 (who modelled his Stemmatographia after an older version of Slavic heraldry composed by Mavro Orbini). Arsenije IV's Stemmatographia was perceived by some as an illustrated political programme that was supposed to act both as a verification of the Serbian historical past and as a clear geo-political statement of the lands belonging to the Serbs in the Balkans. His intention, however, was educational, and for this work he hired three people: Hristofor Zhefarovich originally from Dojran as an artist; German-born Thomas Mesmer as an engraver; and clergyman Pavle Nenadovi\u0107 as a poet. Arsenije IV was well aware of the power of communuication that printed imagery had in those early days of the printing press and the art of engraving. His Stemmatographia was widely distributed among the Serbian villages and towns in the then Habsburg-occupied Serbian lands, and in Imperial Russia where Serbian colonies existed. (The letter from Arsenije IV, written and dated 19 June 1743, demanding a wide distribution is kept in the Archiepiscopal Archives Sremski Karlovci under the presswork B-1743-68).\nThe previous Patriarch Arsenije IV moved north to the Habsburg Monarchy along with many Serbs, in what is known as the Second Serbian Migration. Arsenije IV became Metropolitan of Karlovci, maintaining however deep connections with the Serbs who remained in the Ottoman Empire, particularly the Kosovo Vilayet, now under the Phanariote jurisdiction of Joannicius. Joannicius remained Patriarch of Pe\u0107 until 1746, when, burdened with debts due to his high-living, he was forced to sell the title to pay his creditors. He was succeeded by Atanasije II (Gavrilovi\u0107).\n\n\n== Academy of Painting ==\nThe artistic and cultural reforms commenced in Sremski Karlovci under the auspices and blessing of Metropolitan Vikentije Jovanovi\u0107, was reinforced under his successor, Arsenije IV Jovanovi\u0107 \u0160akabenta, who opened the first official Academy of Painting at his court in the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, and put the entire production of religious art under the firm control of the Serbian Orthodox Church. In 1743 he made an official proclamation in which he invited all those interested in the fine arts to join his Academy of Painting at Karlovci. For that purpose he invited two painters, Jov Vasilijevi\u010d and Vasilije Romanovi\u010d, from Kiev to join the teaching staff at the school. The inauguration of the Academy of Painting in Karlovci would mark the beginning of a new style and artistic idiom, and even more significantly, a novel understanding of the sacred images and its functions.\n\n\n== Title ==\nArsenije signed himself \"Arsenije, By the Grace of God, Archbishop of Pe\u0107 and Patriarch of all Serbs and Bulgarians and all of Illyria\". Another style was \"Archbishop of All Serbs, Bulgarians, Western Pomorje, Dalmatia, Bosnia, both halves of Danube and all of Illyria\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nGreat Serb Migrations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs",

            "content": "George Lloyd Murphy (July 4, 1902 \u2013 May 3, 1992) was an American dancer, actor, and politician. Murphy was a song-and-dance leading man in many big-budget Hollywood musicals from 1930 to 1952. He was the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1944 to 1946, and was awarded an honorary Academy Award in 1951. Murphy served from 1965 to 1971 as U.S. Senator from California, the first notable U.S. actor to make the successful transition to elected official in California, predating Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is the only United States Senator represented by a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born in New Haven, Connecticut, of Irish Catholic extraction, the son of Michael Charles \"Mike\" Murphy, athletic trainer and coach, and the former Nora Long. He was educated at Trinity-Pawling School, Peddie School and Yale University in his native New Haven. He worked as a tool maker for the Ford Motor Company, as a miner, a real estate agent, and a night club dancer.\n\n\n== Film career ==\nIn movies, Murphy was famous as a song-and-dance man and appeared in many big-budget musicals such as Broadway Melody of 1938, Broadway Melody of 1940 and For Me and My Gal. He made his movie debut shortly after talking pictures had replaced silent movies in 1930, and his career continued until he retired as an actor in 1952, at the age of 50.\nIn 1951, he was awarded an honorary Academy Award. He was never nominated for an Oscar in any competitive category.\nHe was the president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1944 to 1946. He was also a vice president of Desilu Studios and of the Technicolor Corporation. He was director of entertainment for presidential inaugurations in 1953, 1957 and 1961.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nMurphy entered politics in 1953 by joining the leadership of the California Republican Party, having also directed the entertainment for the Eisenhower-Nixon inauguration that same year\nIn 1964, he was elected as a Republican to the Senate, having defeated Pierre Salinger, the former presidential press secretary in the Kennedy White House, who had been appointed several months earlier to serve the remainder of the late Clair Engle's unexpired term. Murphy served from January 1, 1965 to January 3, 1971. Murphy assumed his seat two days early, when Salinger resigned from the seat to allow Murphy to gain an edge in seniority. Murphy was then appointed by Democratic Governor Pat Brown to serve the remaining two days of Salinger's term. His election attracted the attention of satirist Tom Lehrer, who wrote and performed a song about him.\nMurphy was in demand for a time to assist other Republican candidates seeking office. In 1966, he hosted a fundraising dinner in Atlanta, Georgia for US Representative Howard \"Bo\" Callaway, the first Republican candidate for Governor of Georgia since Reconstruction.\nIn the election, Callaway outpolled Democrat Lester Maddox, but did not get a majority, and the state legislature elected Maddox.\nIn 1967 and 1968, Murphy was the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. During his Senate term, Murphy developed throat cancer, and part of his larynx had to be removed. For the rest of his life, he was unable to speak above a whisper.\nIn 1970, Murphy ran for re-election; he was challenged by Democratic Us Representative John V. Tunney, the son of famed heavyweight boxing champion Gene Tunney. Murphy's surgery and staunch support for the lingering Vietnam War worked against him, as did reports that he had continued to receive a salary from Technicolor after taking office. Tunney's successful Senate race in 1970 was reportedly the inspiration for the 1972 Robert Redford film The Candidate.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMurphy subsequently moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he died at the age of 89, from leukemia.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nMurphy's move from the screen to California politics paved the way for the successful transitions of actors such as Ronald Reagan and later Arnold Schwarzenegger. Reagan once famously referred to George Murphy as his own \"John the Baptist.\"\nFellow Republicans praised Murphy's ability to speak at fundraising dinners and so consequently backed his bid to become the chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee.\nDuring his tenure in the Senate, Murphy created the candy desk by placing a supply of confectionery on his desk on the US Senate floor. After 1971, the candy-desk duties were bequeathed to a string of successors; since 2015, the keeper of the candy desk has been Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMurphy was married to his ballroom dancing partner, Juliette \"Julie\" Henkel-Johnson, from December 18, 1926 until her death, in 1973. They had two children: Dennis Michael Murphy and Melissa Elaine Murphy.\nHe was married to Bette Blandi from 1982 until his death in 1992. His widow died in 1999.\n\n\n== Radio ==\nSuspense (episode \"Death on Highway 99\" 1945)\nLux Radio Theatre (episode Royal Wedding 1952)\n\n\n== Films ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeorge Murphy on IMDb\nGeorge Murphy at the Internet Broadway Database \nBiographical Directory of the United States Congress\nImages of George Murphy's 1974 passport from www.passportland.com\nGeorge Lloyd Murphy at Find a Grave",

            "content": "Giants is the seventeenth studio album by English rock band The Stranglers and continues the band's return as a four-piece after the departure of Paul Roberts. Lead vocals are shared between guitarist Baz Warne and bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel. The album was released on 5 March 2012 and was supported by an extensive UK tour by the band.\nThe album continues the shift to a more recognisable sound seen in the previous album, Suite XVI, but also builds on a sound much more akin to the band's 70s era.\nThe album was released in the formats of digital download, CD and vinyl with the a deluxe edition of the CD being released with an additional live acoustic disc for the same price. In an interview, Burnel stated that the album has few overdubs so that they can play all the songs live without using any 'trickery', he also stated 'Time Was Once on My Side' is a single of sorts, continuing to question what makes a single in 2012.\nThe album was better promoted than the previous with JJ Burnel appearing on The One Show and also appearing on BBC 1 breakfast with Baz Warne to talk about the album. There was also 19 billboard advertisements put up around London using an alternate image to the album art.\nThe band worked on the album for two years on and off between festivals, gigs and going off places. \"...But some of the ideas stem back to 10 years ago. You can't always make a decent song with just one idea and we've been mulling over some ideas for quite a few years,\" JJ Burnel remarked.\nThe bassist said he was delighted with the initial reaction to their album in the media. \"This record seems to be taking off big time.

A population of French Acadians and Germans who had been living in Louisiana had arrived in M\u00f4le-Saint-Nicolas; and the local government wished to separate those of German ancestry from the Acadians, judging the two cultures could not happily coexist. The new community was named after Fus\u00e9e Aublet's German benefactor, Mr. de Bombarde, a wealthy financier and amateur naturalist.\nDuring the colonial period, Bombardopolis was first a parish under the administration of the Quartier du M\u00f4le-Saint-Nicolas, and then was elevated to canton status in 1797. Bombardopolis was made a commune of the Republic of Haiti in 1821, during the administration of President Jean-Pierre Boyer.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe local economy is mainly based on the production of charcoal, goat farming and fishing.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nThe commune had an estimated adult population of 36,028 for the year 2015.\nThe commune had an estimated adult population of 32,764 for the year 2009.\nThe commune had an enumerated population of 27,360 for the year 2003.\n\n\n== Communal Sections ==\nBombardopolis is subdivided into three communal sections, namely:\nPlate-Forme (contains the municipality of Bombardopolis)\nDes Forges\nPlaine-d'Oranges\n\n\n== References ==",

It was the work of Luigi Acquisti, commissioned by the marquis Tommaso d\u00e8 Buoi, to celebrate the fidelity of his German Weimaraner hound. The dog had fallen from the windowsill in joy at seeing its master returning from a long journey.\nThe terracotta statue was placed on the spot where the dog was supposed to have fallen, at the de\u2019 Buoi\u2019House, now the seat of the Cultural Department of the Municipality of Bologna in via Oberdan 24. After 200 years, atmospheric damage necessitated restoration, and the statue was subsequently displayed at the local Museum of Archeology.

            "content": "Youn Yuh-jung (born June 19, 1947) is a South Korean actress. In a film and television career spanning nearly 40 years, Youn is best known for starring in Woman of Fire (1971), The Housemaid (2010) , The Taste of Money (2012) and The Bacchus Lady (2016).\n\n\n== Career ==\nYoun Yuh-jung was a freshman at Hanyang University majoring in Korean Language and Literature, when she passed the open auditions held by TBC in 1966. She dropped out of college, and made her acting debut in the television drama Mister Gong in 1967. Youn shot to stardom in 1971 with two memorable portrayals of femme fatales. Her first film, Kim Ki-young's Woman of Fire became a critical and commercial hit, for which she won Best Actress at the Sitges Film Festival. This was followed by the MBC period drama series Jang Hui-bin where she played the titular infamous royal concubine. Kim was considered Korea's first style-conscious, experimental director, and Youn didn't balk in playing risque, provocative characters that explore the grotesque in the female psyche in further collaborations with him such as The Insect Woman (1972) and Be a Wicked Woman (1990). Audiences found Youn's fast way of speaking and atypical appearance refreshing and she frequently took roles in TV dramas depicting a modern woman of the new generation, notably in Stepmother (1972) written by Kim Soo-hyun.\nAt the peak of her career, Youn retired after she married singer Jo Young-nam in 1975, then immigrated to the United States. In 1984, she returned to Korea and permanently resumed her acting career. She and Jo divorced in 1987.\nMaking such a stellar comeback after taking a long break was an unusual feat for a Korean middle-aged actress. Though most actresses her age played cliched self-sacrificing mothers or coarse ajummas, Youn's acting range led to her being cast in more complex, stylish, and independent roles. In A Good Lawyer's Wife (2003), she drew critical acclaim for her nonchalant acting as a mother-in-law who neglected her husband dying of liver cancer and enjoyed extramarital affairs. Her frank and confident persona again manifested itself in E J-yong's mockumentary Actresses (2009). Youn continued playing supporting roles in film and television, notably her award-winning scene-stealing turn in The Housemaid (2010). She reunited with director Im Sang-soo for the fourth time in The Taste of Money (2012), as a cruel chaebol heiress at the center of the drama that unfolds and touches upon the themes of corruption, greed and sex. Youn said, \"I don't mind being called an old actress, but I do worry about how to carry on my acting career without looking like an old fool.\"\nIn 2013, she was cast against type as a loving mother to three loser children in Song Hae-sung's Boomerang Family. Later in the year, Youn gained renewed mainstream popularity after appearing in her first ever reality show Sisters Over Flowers, a backpacking travel show shot in Croatia.\nYoun starred in two leading roles in 2015: Kang Je-gyu's Salut d'Amour about the romance between an elderly supermarket employee and a flower shop owner, and Grandmother Gye-choon about a Jeju Island female diver who reunites with her long-lost granddaughter.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television series ===\n\n\n=== Variety show ===\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nYoun Yuh-jung at the Korean Movie Database\nYoun Yuh-jung on IMDb\nYoun Yuh-jung at HanCinema",

            "content": "Lloyd Wilson Bertaud (September 20, 1895 \u2013 September 6, 1927) was an American aviator. Bertaud was selected to be the copilot in the WB-2 Columbia attempting the transatlantic crossing for the Orteig Prize in 1927. Aircraft owner Charles Albert Levine wanted to fly in his place, and an injunction by Bertaud against Levine prevented the flight. The prize was won by the aviator Charles Lindbergh.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBertaud was born in Alameda, California on September 20, 1895. As a boy, he built and flew in a glider from Popular Mechanics plans. He was a licensed pilot at the age of 18. In World War I, Bertaud served in the U.S. Air service as a lieutenant.\nOn September 6, 1927 Bertaud and fellow air-mail pilot James DeWitt Hill flipped to see who would pilot the Fokker monoplane, the Old Glory and Hill won. Bertaud, Hill and Phillip Payne took off in the overweight plane over the Atlantic Ocean. The plane did not make it to the destination, only a 34-foot section of wing was found 700 miles east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Bertaud was lost at sea.\n\n\n== Records and awards ==\nBertaud flew air mail routes along the famous \"Hells Stretch\" between Cleveland and Hadley Field.\nPulitzer Race, Omaha, Nebraska \u2013 In 1921, Bertaud flew a 400 hp Ansando Curtiss A-1 Balilla against Bert Acosta, placing fourth.\nKansas City Derby, Kansas City, Kansas \u2013 In November 1921, Bretaud won the American Legion Aerial Derby over a 140-mile course in 1 hour.\nEndurance record, Roosevelt Field \u2013 In January 1922, Bertaud and Edward Stinson won the Aviation medal of merit of the Aero Club of America for their 27-hour world endurance record flown during a snowstorm in the Larsen JL-6 on December 30, 1921. The aircraft flew 2500 miles, also breaking the French-held world's record for distance.\nOrteig Prize - Charles A. Levine, owner of Columbia Aircraft Corp, and the sole Wright-Bellanca WB-2 sought after by pilot Charles Lindbergh, bumped Bertaud from his copilot position on an attempt at the Orteig Prize. Bertaud was promised a settlement to his family if he and his co-pilot Clarence D. Chamberlin crashed, and the prize money if they completed the flight, but Levine refused to sign the document. Bertaud first objected, then later offered to purchase the Columbia for himself. Bertaud, filed an injunction, and stalled the flight. Lindbergh took off winning the prize. Levine fired Bertaud, and, two weeks later, had Chamberlin fly him to Germany as the first transatlantic passenger. They landed in Eisleben, and breaking Lindbergh's distance mark by 295 miles. Following the flight, Bertaud attempted to have Bellanca, the designer of the Columbia, build a transatlantic plane for a non-stop attempt on Rome in spite of Levine. The aircraft could not be built in a timely manner. Instead, an agreement was made with Phillip Payne, editor of the William Randolph Hearst paper the Daily Mirror, for a Fokker VIIA aircraft, and a spare seat for Payne, in exchange for the publicity rights.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1928, the Ontario Surveyor General named a number of lakes in the northwest of the province to honour aviators who had perished during 1927, mainly in attempting oceanic flights. These include Bertaud Lake (50.90\u00b0N 90.71\u00b0W\ufeff / 50.90; -90.71), Hill Lake (50.56\u00b0N 90.77\u00b0W\ufeff / 50.56; -90.77) and Payne Lake (50.85\u00b0N 90.54\u00b0W\ufeff / 50.85; -90.54).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

In 1984, he made his debut at the international stage as an umpire in both Test matches and one day internationals (ODI), standing in 14 Tests and 22 ODI's until 1994. Piloo Reporter is a Parsi and is known as \"PD\" in the cricketing fraternity. The method by which Reporter signaled a boundary has been called \"Milkshake\" by cricket commentator Henry Blofeld.\nIn 1986, Reporter and VK Ramaswamy became the first neutral umpires from India when they stood in a Test match featuring Pakistan and West Indies in Lahore. This was the first time neutral umpires had officiated in a Test since 1912. They were invited by the Pakistan captain, Imran Khan after allegations of bias by Pakistani umpires. Reporter was the only Indian umpire to officiate in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. A biography has been written on him, An Umpire Remembers.\nIn 1993, Reporter was allegedly paid to give his assessment of the pitch prior to a test in Calcutta to bookie Mukesh Gupta.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Test cricket umpires\nList of One Day International cricket umpires\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPiloo Reporter at CricketArchive (subscription required)\n\"The fearless Indian scourge of chucking\" by V Ramnarayan",

            "content": "The Town of Huntington is one of ten towns in Suffolk County, New York, United States. Founded in 1653, it is located on the north shore of Long Island in northwestern Suffolk County, with Long Island Sound to its north and Nassau County adjacent to the west. Huntington is part of the New York metropolitan area. As of the United States 2010 Census, the town population was 203,264.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1653, three men from Oyster Bay, Richard Holbrook, Robert Williams and Daniel Whitehead, purchased a parcel of land from the Matinecock tribe. This parcel has since come to be known as the \"First Purchase\" and included land bordered by Cold Spring Harbor on the west, Northport Harbor on the east, what is now known as Old Country Road to the south and Long Island Sound to the north. The three men immediately turned the land over to the settlers who had already been living there.\n\nFrom that initial settlement, Huntington grew over subsequent years to include all of the land presently comprising the modern Towns of Huntington and Babylon. The southern part of the town was formally separated to create Babylon in 1872.\nBecause Huntington was populated largely by English settlers, unlike the rest of the New Amsterdam colony, the town voted in 1660 to become part of the Connecticut colony rather than remain under the authority of New Amsterdam. It was not until the British gained control of New Amsterdam in 1664 (renaming it New York) that Huntington was formally restored to the jurisdiction of New York.\nFollowing the Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War, British troops used Huntington as their headquarters, and remained encamped there until the end of the war.\nThe arrival of the Long Island Rail Road in 1867 transformed the economy of Huntington from primarily agriculture and shipping (based on its well protected harbor) to tourism and commuting. Cold Spring Harbor became a popular summer resort.\nThe end of World War II brought about an explosive growth of population in Huntington, as in the rest of the region. Farms and resorts gave way to homes, and Huntington has transformed into a major bedroom community for nearby New York City.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 195,289 people, 65,917 households, and 52,338 families residing in the town. The population density was 2,078.4 people per square mile (802.5/km\u00b2). There were 67,708 housing units at an average density of 720.6 per square mile (278.2/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the town in 2000 was 88.31% White, 4.22% Black or African American, 0.13% Native American, 3.50% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 2.27% from other races, and 1.55% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.58% of the population. As of the census of 2010, the racial makeup of the town was 84.15% White, 4.68% Black or African American, 0.20% Native American, 4.96% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 3.89% from other races, and 2.10% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 11.00% of the population.\nThere were 65,917 households out of which 37.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 67.4% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.6% were non-families. 16.2% of all households were made up of individuals and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.91 and the average family size was 3.26.\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 25.5% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 30.2% from 25 to 44, 25.5% from 45 to 64, and 13.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females there were 96.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.4 males.\nAccording to a 2007 estimate, the median income for a household in the town was $102,865, and the median income for a family was $113,119. Males had a median income of $61,748 versus $40,825 for females. The per capita income for the town was $36,390. About 2.9% of families and 4.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.1% of those under age 18 and 4.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\nThe town government consists of a town council with four members, all of whom are elected at large. The town supervisor is elected by the entire town. Other elected positions are the Town Clerk, Highway Superintendent, and Receiver of Taxes. A referendum to move to a ward district system on December 22, 2009 failed 81% to 18%.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nSbarro's headquarters were located in Melville in the Town of Huntington until 2015.\nAround 2002, Swiss International Air Lines's North American headquarters moved from Melville to Uniondale, Town of Hempstead. The facility, the former Swissair North American headquarter site, was completed in 1995. Swissair intended to own, instead of lease, its headquarters site. It enlisted architect Richard Meier to design the Melville facility.\nIn 1997, Aer Lingus announced that it was moving its North American headquarters from Manhattan to Melville; James Lyndon, a spokesperson for the airline, said that the company moved to Long Island in an effort to reduce costs, as leasing costs are lower in Long Island than in Manhattan. The move would transfer 75 employees, including administrative personnel, marketing personnel, sales personnel, and telephone reservation agents. The airline planned to move on June 15, 1997. The airline had also considered sites in Boston and in Westchester, New York.\n\n\n=== Top employers ===\nAccording to Huntington's 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the town are:\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\nHuntington is home to two colleges and universities, including:\nFive Towns College in Dix Hills\nSeminary of the Immaculate Conception\n\n\n=== Elementary and high schools ===\nThere are a number of notable schools in Huntington.\n\n\n== Local media ==\nSeveral weekly newspapers cover local news exclusively, including The Long-Islander, since 1838 as well as The Times of Huntington by TBR News Media. The Village Connection Magazine, published by Jim Savalli, is a lifestyle and entertainment magazine dedicated to the town of Huntington. Additionally, Patch, an online-only news website owned by AOL, and the Huntington Buzz, an online-only news website that is independently owned, covers hyper-local news on issues, people and events in Huntington.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHuntington is the town in which the American sitcom Growing Pains supposedly takes place. However, Robin Hood Lane, the street address of the Seaver family's home, is fictional. The show's creator, Neal Marlens, grew up in Huntington.\nThe Village of Northport was mentioned in episode 6 of the 2012 NBC drama series Smash.\nOheka Castle in Huntington was featured in the music video for Taylor Swift's 2014 single \"Blank Space\". It also acts as a Hamptons estate in the Royal Pains television series.\nThe Jon Megaris hair salon in Huntington was used as a filming location for the 2015 film Sisters starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.\nSeveral episodes of the USA television series Royal Pains were filmed at West Neck Beach in Huntington.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Communities and locations ==\n\n\n=== Villages (incorporated) ===\nAsharoken\nHuntington Bay\nLloyd Harbor\nNorthport\n\n\n=== Hamlets (unincorporated) ===\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railroad lines ===\nThe Long Island Rail Road's Port Jefferson Branch serves the town's vicinity, and uses stations between Cold Spring Harbor through Northport.

It is found in the Mekong, Bangpakong, and Chao Phraya basins.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis species counts with 25 to 30 anal soft rays. Its dorsum is a dull grey colour with a pale green iridescence. Its maxillary band of teeth forms a continuous row, and its snout protrudes with upper jaw tooth bands which are somewhat exposed when the animal's mouth is closed; it possesses a large median vomerine tooth plate.\nThe fish habitates large rivers and enters flooded forests. It is also found in rapids and in deep slow reaches. Juveniles are found to feed on prawns and insects, while adults on prawns, insects, mollusks, and on plants. The species migrates into the middle Mekong along the Thai-Lao border as water turbidity increases. It is known to reproduce early in the flood season, and juveniles of between 6 to 7 centimetres (2.4 to 2.8 in) are taken by the end of the month of June. It is a local edible specimen.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHung, L.

            "content": "Dwight Graydon \"Gray\" Morrow (March 7, 1934 \u2013 November 6, 2001) was an American illustrator of comics and paperback books. He is co-creator of the Marvel Comics muck-monster the Man-Thing and of DC Comics Old West vigilante El Diablo.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life and career ===\nGray Morrow was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he attended North Side High School. He recalled in 1973 that, \"Comic art was certainly the first artform I remember being impressed with ... [T]hose gorgeous gory newsstand spreads....\" After serving as editor of his high-school yearbook, for which he did cartoons and illustration, and working a number of odd jobs including \"soda jerk, street repairman, tie designer, exercise boy on the race track circuit, etc.,\" he enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, in late summer 1954, studying two nights a week for three months under Jerry Warshaw for \"the total of my entire formal art training.\" His first formal commission \"was something like a bank ad or a tie design when I was still in my teens.\" He joined the city's Feldkamp-Malloy art studio, later being fired. Feeling encouraged by a meeting with comic-strip artist Allen Saunders, Morrow submitted strip samples to various syndicates with no luck.\nUndaunted, he moved to New York City in winter 1955 and by the following spring had met fellow young comics artists Al Williamson, Angelo Torres, and Wally Wood. He sold his first comic-book story, a romance tale, to Toby Press, which went out of business before it could be published. Morrow next did two stories for another company \u2014 a Western with original characters and an adaptation of pulp-fiction writer Robert E. Howard's \"The Tower of the Elephant\", but this company, too, went defunct. He then worked for Williamson and Wood doing backgrounds and layouts, and through Williamson began contributing to Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel Comics, drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories plus at least four Westerns and one war story on titles cover-dated July 1956 to June 1957.\nGray illustrated several stories for EC Comics in the 1950s, including horror, suspense and science fiction. He later did covers and stories for the company's New Trend comics and Picto-Fiction magazines.\nIn late 1956, Morrow was drafted into the U.S. Army. Stationed at Incheon and Wolmido Island, South Korea, with Fox Company, he did \"illustrations and paintings for the officers' club, day rooms, insignias on helmets for their parades ... you know, anything and everything. That was my official duty.\" After being discharged in 1958, \"My friend Angelo Torres took me around to a couple of his clients, one being 'Classics' [i.e., the Gilberton Company, publisher of the Classics Illustrated comic-book series of literary adaptations], and I was given a script. One thing led to another and I was soon working on a regular basis.\nPrior to his Gilberton stint, Morrow contributed to one of the first black-and-white horror-comics magazines, the Joe Simon-edited Eerie Tales #1 (Nov. 1959) from Hastings Associates, penciling and inking two four-page stories by an unknown writer, \"The Stalker\" and \"Burn!\"\n\n\n=== 1960s to 1970s ===\nIn the early 1960s, Morrow anonymously illustrated three literary adaptations for Classics Illustrated: The Octopus by Frank Norris (#159, Nov. 1960); Master of the World by Jules Verne (#163, July 1961); and The Queen's Necklace by Alexandre Dumas (#165, Jan. 1962), which he said he penciled and inked at the rate of \"eight pages a day ... as fast as I've ever been able to go\" since \"I'd moved to California and needed those checks badly.\" Morrow also supplied drawings for chapters in Classics Illustrated Special Issue #159A, Rockets, Jets and Missiles (Dec. 1960), and in 13 World Around Us issues ranging from Prehistoric Animals (Nov. 1959) to Famous Teens (May 1961). One of those, #W28, Whaling (Dec. 1960), resulted in unexpected controversy when he accurately depicted African-American whalers:\n\n[T]he page rate [at Gilberton in general] wasn't much for the accuracy and authenticity they expected, but it was a challenge to 'do it right.' Roberta and Len Cole were demanding but genial editors. One job I do remember ... something about whaling, got me in dutch [i.e. trouble] with Roberta. My research indicated that many of the whalers were black \u2014 so that's what I drew. She had a fit and insisted they all be redrawn to 'avoid controversy.'\n\nIn the end, the problematic chapter, \"The Long Voyage\", retained what one comics historian called \"a respectable number of African-American whalemen.\" Morrow, however, recalled, \"[T]hey had me make them all white. I had to change their features.\"\nConcurrently, Morrow also illustrated entries in the Bobbs-Merrill juvenile book series \"Childhood of Famous Americans\", continuing with that publisher after Gilberton ceased production of new titles. Morrow's art appears in Henry Clay: Young Kentucky Orator (1963), Douglas MacArthur: Young Protector and other entries. Some, including Crispus Attucks, Black Leader of Colonial Patriots, Teddy Roosevelt, Young Rough Rider, and Abner Doubleday: Young Baseball Pioneer, were reprinted by successor publishers in the 1980s and 1990s.\nMorrow next began a three-year association with Warren Publishing's line of black-and-white horror-comics magazines in 1964, starting with the six-page story \"Bewitched!,\" written by Larry Ivie, in Creepy #1, and contributed over a dozen stories to that magazine and its sister publication Eerie, as well as to the war-comics magazine Blazing Combat, through 1967. He also painted four horror covers for Warren. For competitor Skywald Publications, he drew the eight-page \"The Skin And Bones Syndrome\" for Psycho #1 (Jan. 1971), and co-created the muck-monster Man-Thing, with writers Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, in Marvel Comics' first entry into the adult-oriented comics-magazine market, the black-and-white Savage Tales #1 (May 1971).\n\nBy 1970, Morrow was married to Betty Morrow, who wrote a story he drew, \"The Journey\", in the early independent comic witzend #7 (1970). That same year he returned to color comics, drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories for DC Comics' Witching Hour, House of Secrets and House of Mystery, as well as a smattering of romance and superhero tales. He also drew Western stories, and with writer Robert Kanigher co-created the Old West vigilante El Diablo in All-Star Western #2 (Oct. 1970). He did a small amount of work for Marvel during this time, with the cover and a romance story for My Love #14 (Nov. 1971), a Man-Thing cover and story in Adventure into Fear #10 (Oct. 1972), two \"Gullivar Jones, Warrior of Mars\" stories in Creatures on the Loose #20-21 (Nov. 1972 - Jan. 1973), and virtually his only Marvel superhero story, a 10-page Falcon feature in Captain America #144 (Dec. 1971).\nBy 1973, Morrow had served as an uncredited ghost artist or art assistant on the syndicated comic strips Rip Kirby by John Prentice, Secret Agent X-9 by Al Williamson and Big Ben Bolt by John Cullen Murphy. He took over the Buck Rogers strip in 1979 and the Tarzan Sunday strip from 1983 to 2001. He recalled trying out for Prince Valiant, saying he provided a sample \"when [strip creator] Hal Foster decided to go into semi-retirement. It was done in August and published in October or November of '71. It was done as a sample when Foster interviewed [me] and a couple of others (Wally Wood and John Cullen Murphy) to take over.\"\nThrough 1974 and early 1975, he edited and frequently drew stories for Archie Comics' imprint of non-teen-humor titles, Red Circle Comics, including Chilling Adventures in Sorcery, its successor Red Circle Sorcery, and the single-issue The Super Cops, based on two real-life New York City Police Department detectives. Following this, he specialized in covers and stories for such black-and-white Marvel magazines as Masters of Terror, Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction and Marvel Preview. Afterward, through 1976, he was art director of Charlton Comics' black-and-white magazine Space: 1999, based on the TV series of that name. Active in the early independent comics of the 1970s, Morrow contributed mostly spot illustrations, covers and pinups rather than stories to titles including publisher David Jablin's Imagination #1 (1971); Mark Feldman's I'll Be Damned #4 (1971); John Carbonaro's Phase #1 (Sept. 1971); Doug Murray & Richard Garrison Heritage #1A and 1B (1972); and Gary Berman & Adam Malin's Infinity #2, 3B, 4-5 (1970?-1973).\n\nIn 1978, he began publishing, in Heavy Metal magazine, a series of stories that would be collected in 2012 as chapters of the sword and sorcery graphic novel Orion. Likewise, his Playboy feature \"Amora\", which he both wrote and drew, was collected as Heritage presents ... Amora, from the Forest Park, Georgia publisher Heritage in 1971. He illustrated and colored each of the several Roger Zelazny stories that the author self-adapted for the 96-page graphic short-story collection The Illustrated Roger Zelazny, produced by Byron Preiss Enterprizes and published by Baronet Publishing in February 1979.\nIn addition to comics, Morrow in the 1960s and 1970s was an illustrator for many science-fiction magazines, with examples of his work gracing most of the covers of the American version of the Perry Rhodan paperback-book series. He also did the illustrations for the original Galaxy Science Fiction publication of the Hugo-winning novella Soldier, Ask Not by Gordon R. Dickson. Additionally, he drew for satirical-humor magazine National Lampoon\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nIn the 1980s, he wrote and drew Pacific Comics' three-issue Edge of Chaos (July 1983 - Jan. 1984), a science-fiction retelling of the story of the Greek gods. Through the decade he did sporadic but diverse work for Marvel and DC, ranging from stories of Lois Lane to those of Mark Hazzard: Merc, as well as horror and science-fiction stories for Eclipse Comics; satirical humor for Cracked; \"The Sex Vampires from Outer Space\"and other stories for the same publisher's black-and-white comics magazine Monsters Attack; and Marvel Graphic Novel: Dreamwalker (1989), a 63-page superhero/espionage thriller written by actors Miguel Ferrer and Bill Mumy. He drew the comics adaptations of the Sheena and Supergirl movies in 1984.\nThe following decade, continuing his trend of wide-ranging work, he drew the superhero feature \"Powerline\", by writers D. G. Chichester and Margaret Clark, in several issues of the Marvel/Epic Comics anthology A Shadowline Saga: Critical Mass; inked Michael Davis Lawrence on writer Mike Grell's DC Comics miniseries Shado: Song of the Dragon #1-4; contributed to DC's \"The Big Book of...\" trade paperback line of non-fiction vignettes on a variety of topics; drew the Historical Souvenir Co.'s 40-page, non-fiction Epic Battles of the Civil War #2 - Shiloh (1998); drew children's Mighty Morphin Power Rangers adventurers for Hamilton Comics and adult-oriented stories for Penthouse Comix; and did work for such independent comics publishers as Aardwolf Publishing, Dark Horse Comics and NBM, and the underground comix publisher Rip Off Press. His last new work was his posthumously published contribution, with four other artists, to the 10-page story \"Letters From a Broken Apple\", written by Neil Kleid, in Alternative Comics' benefit one-shot 9-11 Emergency Relief (Jan. 2002).\n\n\n=== Other work ===\nMorrow worked in television animation, including on a Spider-Man TV series, and was a member of The Animation Guild, I.A.T.S.E. Local 839.\nHe painted or drew the theatrical one-sheet for the Al Adamson horror film Five Bloody Graves (1970), and drew the King Kong cover of the premiere issue of The Monster Times.\n\n\n=== Personal life ===\nBy 1973, when he was living in Brooklyn, Morrow was married with a family that included adopted children.\nHe was living in Kunkletown, Pennsylvania, and suffering from Parkinson's Disease when he died November 6, 2001, apparently from a gunshot wound. He was survived by his later wife, Pocho Morrow.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nMorrow was nominated for the Hugo Award for best professional artist in 1966, 1967, and 1968. In 2005, he was posthumously inducted into the Oklahoma Cartoonists Associates Hall of Fame in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, located in the Toy and Action Figure Museum.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nMorrow, Gray; Seuling, Phil (1970).

            "content": "The Corts Valencianes (Valencian pronunciation: [\u02c8ko\u027e(d)z valensi\u02c8anes]), commonly known as Les Corts ([les \u02c8ko\u027e(t)s]), are the main legislative body of the Generalitat Valenciana and therefore of the Valencian Community. The main location of the Corts is in the Palace of the Borgias in Valencia; however it can meet at any location in Valencian territory. The Corts has its origins in bodies established in the thirteenth century by King James I of Aragon. The modern institution was established in 1982 under the Valencian statute of autonomy of 1982. The current Corts were elected in 2015.\n\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the conquest and reign of James I of Aragon, the economic and military needs of the Crown of Aragon justified some meetings of the king with representatives of the three social classes (the nobility, who controlled the military forces, the church and the middle class), to obtain military or financial services. The economic needs justified those meetings, and at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a stable institution called the Corts Valencianes had already been established.\nAmong the meetings which were held during the reign of James I, the most important was that of 7 April 1261 in Valencia, during which the king promulgated the Furs of Valencia, a series of charters equivalent to a modern constitution. Proof of the economic importance of the corts for the crown is that the king promulgated the Furs in exchange for the sum of 48,000, which were paid to him by the city of Valencia, by the cities of the Horta de Val\u00e8ncia which belonged to the clergy and to the nobility, and by the towns of Castell\u00f3, Vilafam\u00e9s, Onda, Ll\u00edria, Corbera, Cullera and Gandia.\nAt the time of those corts, King James established a rule for his successors obliging them to organise a general cort in Valencia at the beginning of each reign, in the first month after their entry into the city. This obligation was renewed during the corts of 1271, the corts were summoned by James I and later by his son Peter III of Aragon. Those Corts were the only obligatory meetings, but the king summoned the corts on other occasions when required.\nIn 1302, James II decided that it was necessary to summon the corts every three years. Later, during the corts of 1336, Peter IV confirmed this triennial meeting, by specifying that the corts were to meet every three years on All Saints' Day.\nDuring the thirteenth century and at the beginning of the fourteenth, the representations of the other cities in the Kingdom of Valencia were gradually added, until the corts of 1239, during which the representations of various territories met, already constituting the corts of all the Kingdom.\nFrom that moment, the most important cities always met, while others attended depending on the relevance to them of the subjects being discussed. However, the representation was generally important. For example, in the Corts of Valencia of 1510, the following towns were represented: Adem\u00fas, Alacant, Alcoi, Alpuente, Alzira, Biar, Bocairent, Borriana, Cabdet, Castell\u00f3, Castielfabib, Cullera, Ll\u00edria, Morella, Ontinyent, Orihuela, Pen\u00e0guila, Pen\u00edscola, Val\u00e8ncia, Vila Joiosa, Vila-real, X\u00e0tiva, X\u00e8rica and Xixona. Half of the assemblies took place in Valencia cathedral.\nThe Valencian Corts of 1418, fixed the duration of the corts at three years. In the middle of the fifteenth century, the Valencian institutions were definitively established.\nWith the unification of the crowns of Castille and Aragon, the Valencian corts declined in importance and were less frequently convened during the sixteenth century, a trend that continued in the seventeenth century. The last corts met in Valencia in 1645. Finally, after the War of the Spanish Succession and the new decree of 1707, the Kingdom of Valencia and its local rights were abolished.\nThe Corts Valencianes were not convened again until their reestablishment under the Statute of Autonomy of 1982. As of the coming into effect of the Statute of Autonomy, the Corts have operated like a modern representative legislature. Although usually meeting in the provincial capital of Valencia city, they have met in various towns around the Valencian community in recent years, an initiative which has been developed by the most recent legislatures.\n\n\n== Modern legislatures ==\nThe first legislature in modern times was elected in May 1983. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) won an absolute majority of votes and seats, with 51 of the 89 seats. However they lost their majority in 1987 and were forced to govern in coalition with the smaller United Left party. They won the 1991 elections with a majority of one seat, winning 45 seats in total. However, in the 1995 elections there was a swing to the right with the People's Party (PP) becoming the largest party with 42 seats and governing in coalition with the smaller Uni\u00f3 Valenciana (Valencian Union). This lasted until the elections of 1999 when the PP won an absolute majority with 49 seats. Although they lost a seat in 2003, they strengthened their position in the elections of 2007 and 2011, winning a record 55 seats. In the 2015 elections PP lost the majority, and PSPV and Comprom\u00eds are governing in coalition.\n\n\n== Organisation, rules and composition ==\n\nFollowing the passing of the statute of autonomy of the Valencian Community, which established local government for the region, the Corts became the regional assembly, elected every four years by universal adult suffrage.\nThe name originated in the historic Valencian Corts, however previous bodies of that name had different functions representing three institutions: the clergy, the military/nobility and the royal family.\nThe Statute of Autonomy primarily defines the Corts Valencianes in chapter II, title II, although there are also references in other articles. The Statute simply indicates the composition of Corts, its functions, the basic principles of the electoral system, and traces the general framework of the Statute of the Deputies. Laws which develop the Statute, the rules of the Corts Valencianes regulate the organization and the operation of the Corts. The first rules were adopted during the transition stage. Since that moment, the rules have been modified on various occasions; the current drafting was ratified on 30 June 1994.\nThe 1982 Statute of Autonomy states that the Corts will have a number of deputies ranging from 75 to 100. The current electoral law fixes the number at 99 deputies, divided according to the provinces and the electoral constituencies. Currently in the legislature 35 deputies are elected for the Province of Alicante, 24 deputies for the Province of Castell\u00f3n and 40 deputies for the Province of Valencia. The Statute of Autonomy also states that to be elected, candidates must belong to a list which obtains at least 5% of the total number of votes. Certain political parties and alliances who fail to achieve that threshold, cannot enter the Parliament. For lists which cross the 5% barrier, the distribution of seats is done according to the D'Hondt method.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Presidents of the Valencian Parliament\nPalace of the Borgias\nGeneralitat Valenciana\nKingdom of Valencia\nFurs of Valencia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of the Valencian Parliament (in English) (in Spanish)",

Pei Hwa High School was established in 1929 by Mr. Cai Jing San, Mr. Zheng Qing Mou, Mr. Li Hui Mu, Mr. Zhang Yu Cai, Mr. Liu Guang Wen, Mr. Cai Qi Zheng, Mr. Chen Shu, Mr. Li Guo Zhu (transliteration) and others. Pei Hwa High School was one of the minorities of schools that decided to remain apart from Malaysia national school system. It was set up with the main intention of providing education in the Chinese language. Being an independent school, the school does not receive funding from the Malaysian government and needs to sustain itself through student fees and donations from the public.\nStudents in the school study in three junior middle levels and three senior middle levels, similar to the secondary school systems in mainland China and Taiwan; each level usually takes one year. Like the students in public secondary schools, students in the school are put into several streams like Science or Art/Commerce in the senior middle levels. They take standardised tests known as the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) at the end of Junior Middle 3 and Senior Middle 3.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n=== Brief History ===\n\n\n==== 1929\u20131946 ====\nPei Hwa Primary School was established in 1929 by local enthusiasts is located at Yu Yuan Huo Jiao Chang, San Jiao Bu. Later, the school moved to Kwang Tung Association. The student population increased so much that the school borrowed premises from Chinese Rubber Trade Association as the second school building in 1936. At the same time, Tai Chang Company contributed a piece of land and the school also purchased a piece of land for building purpose, the school space increased to 4 acres. In 1938, the school moved to its new building; the number of students was around 140.\nFollowing the Japanese occupation of Malaysia in 1942, the school was forced to stop classes, all the school equipment was destroyed. In 1946, classes resumed.\n\n\n==== 1947\u20131962 ====\nWith the development of the school and the demands of society, the school opened upper primary classes in 1947. In 1949, the school started enrolling junior middle one\u2019s students, secondary education was begun and school gradually increased in size. Lack of school buildings to expand the school construction projects in full swing. By 1958, the number of the students is over 1,000, due to lack of facilities, primary and secondary schools are forced to have double shifts, morning and afternoon shifts, minimising the hours children spend in school. The primary school is quite separate from secondary school in the same year. Primary school moved to their present location at second year, now namely Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Cina Pei Hwa (SJK(C) Pei Hwa). In 1960, the school offer higher secondary classes, becoming the highest institution in North Muar.\nUnder The Education Act 1961, the school was reform into Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Pei Hwa (SMJK Pei Hwa), also led the student movement during the restructuring. However, mother-tongue education SHOULD NOT be abandoned. Because of the school original calibration certificates are still saved, so the council of the school decided to continue the provision of mother-tongue education, the school re-run Chinese-language school, the Pei Hwa High School soon after reformed. Earlier, the school students mostly are students whose ages were older than the average.\n\n\n==== 1963\u2013Present ====\nThe school faced their deepest crisis since its founding having to focus as much on economic challenges and the source of students, in addition, the school did not have its own campus, and it was just only sharing facilities with SMJK Pei Hwa. In 1971, Che Kuan Khor Moral Uplifting Society, Sungai Mati and the Chairman of Pei Hwa Alumni Association, Mr Wu Nai Guang donated a piece of land to the school for school construction purposes. The school was moved to its current location in 1975, just across from SMJK Pei Hwa. At that time, the school had only 46 students.\nWith the development of the school, the number of students went up to 717 in 1987. With the rapid development of information technology, the school started their computer classes. The school became the first to establish furniture-carpentry courses in 1989. From 1996 to 1999, the carpentry class students have participated in The Malaysia Skills Competition (MSC) and won Prime Minister's Golden Hands Awards for four consecutive years. The students of the carpentry class represented Malaysia to take part in The 35th WorldSkills International Competition in Montreal, Canada in 1999. But the carpentry class suspended in 2001 for lack of finances. Science classes were reopened in 2001. In June 2004, the school brought back a 6-day school week.\nOn 28 July 2008, the school signed a sister school agreement with Tsun Jin High School, Kuala Lumpur.

            "content": "George Miller III (born May 17, 1945) is an American politician who served as a United States Representative from California from 1975 until his retirement in 2015. He is a member of the Democratic Party. From 2007 to 2011, Miller served as chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.\n\n\n== Early life, education, and early career ==\nThe son of liberal State Senator and Democratic Party leader George Miller, Jr., he was born in Richmond, California in 1945. He graduated from Diablo Valley Community College and San Francisco State University.\nAfter his father died in 1969, Miller ran in a March 1969 special election to succeed him as state senator for California's 7th State Senate district, but Republican John Nejedly defeated him 57% to 42%.\nHe then attended the University of California, Davis School of Law (King Hall), where he received his Juris Doctor. After admission to the university, he served as legislative assistant to California Senate majority leader George Moscone before entering the U.S. House of Representatives in 1974.\n\n\n== U.S. House of Representatives ==\n\n\n=== Elections ===\nIn 1974, incumbent Democratic U.S. Representative Ron Dellums decided to run in the newly redrawn 8th district. Miller decided to run for the open seat in California's 7th congressional district. He won the primary with a plurality of 38%. In the general election, he defeated Republican Gary Fernandez 56% to 44%, the lowest winning percentage of his career. He went on to win re-election 18 times, and never won with less than 60% of the vote.\n2012\n\nAfter redistricting, Miller's district was redrawn and renumbered the 11th. He ran against, and defeated, Republican Virginia Fuller in the general election.\nIn a 2012 campaign ad, Miller said that the main challenge the U.S. faces is the need \u201cto correct the disparities that exist in our country.\u201d\nFuller has spoken of her inspiration to run against Miller: \"We are going deeper and deeper into a debt our children will never be able to pay.\" Democratic primary challenger John Fitzgerald, for his part, said that \u201cpeople like us\u201d need to run for Congress because D.C. pols are no longer in touch with the world.\n\n\n=== Tenure ===\n\nAccording to the National Journal, Miller is one of seven members of the House of Representatives who tie for most liberal.\nIn 2011-12, Miller sponsored 10 bills (placing him at #40 out of 440 House members), none of which were made into law (ranks 18 of 440). He co-sponsored 199 bills (placing him at #138 out of 440), 4 of which were made Into law (ranks 17 of 440).\nDuring Miller's 1974 campaign, he routinely disclosed his donors and expenses, taking advantage of the Watergate scandal that was still in the minds of voters. This helped get him a seat in the House at the age of 29, becoming one of the Watergate Babies. Miller is one of the three remaining Congressmen elected in the class following the Watergate scandal - the others are Henry Waxman and Rick Nolan - and has spent over half of his life in Congress. One of the 10 most senior members of Congress, Miller has been described as someone who has \"proven himself both a liberal lion ...and savvy about working both sides of the aisle.\u201d\nWith his father being the former chairman of the state Senate Finance Committee and mentor Phillip Burton being an integral part of liberal politics in the 1970s, Miller has been described as the \u201cheir to a tradition of Bay Area working-class politics.\u201d Miller has one of the most liberal voting records in the House, and brings \"a zest for political combat.\" A review of Miller's career states that, although he has been unsuccessful in his pursuit of top party positions, he has \"learned a legislator\u2019s virtues of patience, timing, and creativity.\"\nEnvironmental issues\nIn the House, Miller was a member of the Natural Resources Committee; he was that Committee's chairman from 1991 to 1994. Miller supported efforts to preserve public lands such as the 1994 California Desert Protection Act, which among other things created Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park. In addition, Miller was the chief sponsor of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992, which mandated that the federal government's Bureau of Reclamation manage the Central Valley Project in order to better protect the fish and wildlife populations of California's Bay-Delta region. Miller lost his chairmanship when Republicans won control of Congress in 1994. He stayed as the committee's Ranking Member until 2000. and remained on the committee as a member until 2015. Miller was also a member of the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus.\nLabor issues\nFrom 2001 to 2006, Miller was the ranking Democrat on the Education and the Workforce Committee. With that committee's chairman and their Senate counterparts, Miller helped draft the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001 and 2002. Miller has focused on pension issues, reinstating Davis-Bacon Act wage protections for Gulf Coast workers in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Miller has worked on education issues such as protesting student aid cuts, increasing No Child Left Behind Act funding, and investigating the Bush administration's hiring of Armstrong Williams to promote that law. Miller has also been a vocal advocate of labor and immigration reform in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In 2007, as chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, Miller sponsored the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which was enacted into law as an amendment to another bill. In 2001, Miller said, \"The secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose.\" He was an \"outspoken critic of the apparel industry record on worker safety in foreign factories, most recently in Bangladesh.\"\nEducation\nMiller sponsored the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act, a bill that would require school districts receiving federal funds to give all employees criminal background checks. The bill passed the House of Representatives on October 22, 2013.\nPort Chicago disaster\nMiller has petitioned to clear the names of the sailors of the World War II Port Chicago disaster in which more than 200 black men were court-martialed and 50 convicted of mutiny for refusing to continue to load ammunition onto warships after a tremendous explosion killed hundreds. For the most part, Miller's efforts failed, and fewer than four of the sailors convicted of mutiny are still alive. However, in 1999, President Bill Clinton pardoned Freddie Meeks, one of the 50 mutineers. In addition, Miller wrote the legislation to designate the site of the event as a National Memorial.\nNative American gaming\nMiller was a supporter of Native American gaming. In 2000, as ranking member of the House Resource Committee, Miller inserted an amendment to the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act that took an existing cardroom into federal trust for the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians. The amendment made the land acquisition retroactive to 1987, stating that \"[s]uch land shall be deemed to have been held in trust and part of the reservation of the Rancheria prior to October 17, 1988.\" This allowed the Lyttons to open a casino at the cardroom under the terms of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. Some members of Congress and the gambling industry have called the amendment \"underhanded,\" while other politicians have called the maneuver nothing out of the ordinary.\n2008 presidential election\nMiller, a superdelegate in the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primary, pledged his support to Barack Obama despite the fact that his district voted for Hillary Clinton. Miller cited Obama's grassroots fundraising campaign, first-place win in the Iowa caucus and strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, leadership style and opposition to the Iraq War as reasons for his endorsement. The endorsement was first reported in the Contra Costa Times on January 9, 2008.\nRelationship with Nancy Pelosi\nMiller has been considered Nancy Pelosi's most trusted confidant, with conservative columnist Robert Novak describing him as \"her consigliere, always at her side.\" Pelosi receives advice from Miller as well as protection from potential adversaries in the Democratic Caucus. Miller describes her as the leader he has been waiting for 30 years and supported her when the Democrats lost the majority in 2010, saying that the Obama administration did not defend her or her accomplishments. Pelosi also named Miller chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, where he had an influential role in preparing the \"New Direction\" for the 2006 election.\nTheir friendship has spanned \"over 30 years and many plane trips to Washington from their neighboring California districts,\" with some colleagues saying that they have become so close that they finish each other's sentences. The New York Times reported that \"In the concerns of some Democrats \u2014 and the I-told-you-so\u2019s of some Republicans \u2014 Mr. Miller represents Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s true liberal soul.\u201d\nSunPower controversy\nIt was reported that Miller and his son, George Miller IV, a lobbyist, were involved in the controversy surrounding the U.S. Department of Energy awarding a $1.2 billion loan to the struggling SunPower Corporation. The loan was awarded hours before the DOE program was set to expire. It was reported that by April 2012, the company's stock had fallen nearly 50% since the loan had been awarded. SunPower has paid Miller's son and his lobbying firm US$138,000 to represent them. Miller asserts that he and his son never discusses legislation; his son, however, does boast of political connections in Washington openly.\nConservative critics said that \"[t]here is great cause for alarm over political influence contaminating the DOE loan guarantee program.\u201d Liberal sources note speaking with Miller IV on the phone, and reported his statement he does not specifically work on SunPower's account.\nAccepting free travel\nIn January 2012, Miller was cited as one of the members of Congress who had accepted the most free travel the previous year.\n\n\n=== Committee assignments ===\nCommittee on Education and Labor (ranking member)\nAs ranking member of the full committee, Miller may serve as an ex officio member of all subcommittees of which he is not already a voting member.\nSubcommittee on Workforce Protections\nSubcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions\n\nUnited States House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families (Chair)\n\n\n=== Caucus memberships ===\nCongressional Progressive Caucus\nCongressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus\nInternational Conservation Caucus\nHouse Democratic Steering and Policy Committee (Co-Chair for Policy)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMiller owned a townhouse in Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. for decades, renting rooms to fellow members of the U.S. House, even after some moved to the Senate. His longest-standing tenants were Senators Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin. Miller purchased the residence in 1977 and sold it when he retired from the House at the end of 2014. Prior tenants included former Representatives Marty Russo, Leon Panetta and Sam Gejdenson.\n\n\n== Electoral history ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGeorge Miller, Employee Free Choice, The Nation, January 19, 2006\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeorge Miller at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n\nBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nProfile at Project Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nAppearances on C-SPAN",

Where each line cuts the circle is a vertex of the decagon.\nThe five corners of the pentagon constitute alternate corners of the decagon. Join these points to the adjacent new points to form the decagon.\n\n\n== The golden ratio in decagon ==\nBoth in the construction with given circumcircle as well as with given side length is the golden ratio dividing a line segment by exterior division the determining construction element.\nIn the construction with given circumcircle the circular arc around G with radius GE3 produces the segment AH, whose division corresponds to the golden ratio.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n                M\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n            \n              \n                M\n                H\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                A\n                H\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n            \n              \n                A\n                M\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                \n                  5\n                \n              \n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \u03a6\n        \u2248\n        1.618\n        \n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\overline {AM}}{\\overline {MH}}}={\\frac {\\overline {AH}}{\\overline {AM}}}={\\frac {1+{\\sqrt {5}}}{2}}=\\Phi \\approx 1.618{\\text{.}}}\n  \nIn the construction with given side length the circular arc around D with radius DA produces the segment E10F, whose division corresponds to the golden ratio.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  E\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n                \n                  E\n                  \n                    10\n                  \n                \n              \n              \u00af\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  E\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n                F\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  E\n                  \n                    10\n                  \n                \n                F\n              \n              \u00af\n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  E\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n                \n                  E\n                  \n                    10\n                  \n                \n              \n              \u00af\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            R\n            a\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                \n                  5\n                \n              \n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \u03a6\n        \u2248\n        1.618\n        \n          .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\overline {E_{1}E_{10}}}{\\overline {E_{1}F}}}={\\frac {\\overline {E_{10}F}}{\\overline {E_{1}E_{10}}}}={\\frac {R}{a}}={\\frac {1+{\\sqrt {5}}}{2}}=\\Phi \\approx 1.618{\\text{.}}}\n  \n\n\n== Symmetry ==\n\nThe regular decagon has Dih10 symmetry, order 20. There are 3 subgroup dihedral symmetries: Dih5, Dih2, and Dih1, and 4 cyclic group symmetries: Z10, Z5, Z2, and Z1.\nThese 8 symmetries can be seen in 10 distinct symmetries on the decagon, a larger number because the lines of reflections can either pass through vertices or edges. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is r20 and no symmetry is labeled a1. The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices (d for diagonal) or edges (p for perpendiculars), and i when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as g for their central gyration orders.\nEach subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the g10 subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can seen as directed edges.\nThe highest symmetry irregular decagons are d10, a isogonal decagon constructed by five mirrors which can alternate long and short edges, and p10, an isotoxal decagon, constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular decagon.\n\n\n== Dissection of regular decagon ==\nCoxeter states that every parallel-sided 2m-gon can be divided into m(m-1)/2 rhombs. For the decagon, m=5, and it can be divided into 10 rhombs, with one example shown below. This decomposition can be seen as 10 of 80 faces in a Petrie polygon projection plane of the 5-cube. A second dissection is based on 10 of 30 faces of the rhombic triacontahedron.\n\n\n== Skew decagon ==\nA skew decagon is a skew polygon with 10 vertices and edges but not existing on the same plane. The interior of such an decagon is not generally defined. A skew zig-zag decagon has vertices alternating between two parallel planes.\nA regular skew decagon is vertex-transitive with equal edge lengths. In 3-dimensions it will be a zig-zag skew decagon and can be seen in the vertices and side edges of a pentagonal antiprism, pentagrammic antiprism, and pentagrammic crossed-antiprism with the same D5d, [2+,10] symmetry, order 20.\nThese can also be seen in these 4 convex polyhedra with icosahedral symmetry. The polygons on the perimeter of these projections are regular skew decagons.\n\n\n=== Petrie polygons ===\nThe regular skew decagon is the Petrie polygon for many higher-dimensional polytopes, shown in these orthogonal projections in various Coxeter planes: The number of sides in the Petrie polygon is equal to the Coxeter number, h, for each symmetry family.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDecagonal number and centered decagonal number, figurate numbers modeled on the decagon\nDecagram, a star polygon with the same vertex positions as the regular decagon\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Decagon\".

He was Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire between 1553 and 1555.\nHe led the Ottoman troops that captured the Hungarian fortress of Temesv\u00e1r, defended by the troop of Istv\u00e1n Losonczy, on 26 July 1552. That year, his army took three other castles (Veszpr\u00e9m, Szolnok and Lipova) before failing at the Siege of Eger.\nAfter Sultan Suleiman executed his eldest son \u015eehzade Mustafa in October 1553, there appeared some sort of dissatisfaction and unrest among soldiers who blamed R\u00fcstem Pasha for Mustafa's death. Then Suleiman dismissed R\u00fcstem Pasha and appointed Kara Ahmed Pasha as his Grand Vizier in October 1553. But almost two years later, Kara Ahmed was strangled by Suleiman's order in September 1555. It is said that the reason for the execution was due to political manoeuvrings of Suleiman's legal wife H\u00fcrrem Sultan, who wanted her son-in-law R\u00fcstem to become the Grand Vizier again. After the death of Kara Ahmed, R\u00fcstem Pasha became the Grand Vizier (1555-1561) once more.\n\n\n== Depictions in literature and popular culture ==\nIn the TV series Muhte\u015fem Y\u00fczy\u0131l, Kara Ahmed Pasha is played by Turkish actor Yetkin Dikinciler.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Ottoman Grand Viziers\n\n\n== References ==",

It is also known as the Tilghman-Woolfolk House and the Lloyd Tilghman House and Civil War Museum.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThe Greek Revival house was built in 1852 by Robert Woolfolk on the behalf of Lloyd Tilghman, who had just moved with his family to Paducah that year. Tilghman was a West Point graduate, having finished 46th out of 49 in his class, but spent less than a year as a Second Lieutenant. He moved to Paducah, then a community of 3,000 people, due to being assigned there by his employer, the New Orleans and Ohio Railroad, as a railroad civil engineer for the first railroad to connect Paducah to major cities to the south. Tilghman did not purchase the house; Woolfolk remained the owner of the property. Tilghman and his wife, seven children, and five slaves called the residence home until 1861, although Tilghman spent much of his time working on a railroad in the Isthmus of Panama. At the time of his departure from the home, he was one of two colonels of the Kentucky State Guard whose stated purpose was to defend the state's neutrality. He officially left Paducah in June 1861, delaying his departure to prevent more pro-Union officers from leading the state militia in Paducah.\nWoolfolk's family then moved into the home. When Federal troops finally arrived in Paducah, their headquarters were directly across from the Woolfolk home. Woolfolk was pro-Southern and flew a Confederate flag in response, sparking a riot in December 1861 that included Union soldiers, particularly those of the 11th Indiana Regiment. The incident would begin Brigadier General Charles Ferguson Smith's decline as he saw his subordinate, Ulysses S. Grant, raised above him almost immediately.\nWoolfolk was banished from Paducah and the United States to Canada on August 1, 1864 by Union Brigadier General Eleazer A. Paine. Two weeks later his wife and family were also banished to Canada, which resulted in eight of Woolfolk's household, four others from Paducah, and eleven from Columbus, Kentucky following Woolfolk into exile. These acts infuriated the Kentucky governor, and Paine was removed from command in Paducah after only 90 days.\n\n\n== Post-war ==\n\nAfter the war the house was a residence until 1906, where it would see various commercial uses. It was slated for demolition in August 1986, but after work by Growth, Inc. the building was saved. In 1987 the roof was stabilized, and in 1992 it came under the care of the Tilghman Heritage Foundation. A total of $150,000 was spent to save the building from 1986 to 1998.\nIt is now used as a Civil War Museum focusing on the western theater of the war. Upon its grand reopening on March 25, 2006, the museum focused on Western Kentucky's role in the war. On December 1, 2008 the Sons of Confederate Veterans purchased the home from the foundation, with each group paying half of the remaining $150,000 mortgage. The museum is to keep its previous operation hours of noon to 4pm, Wednesday through Saturday, from March to November.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJacobsen, James E. (1998).

            "content": "The accordion is in a wide variety of musical genres, mainly in traditional and popular music. In some regions, such as Europe and North-America it has become mainly restricted to traditional, folk and ethnic music. In other regions such as Mexico, the instrument is very popular in genres like Norte\u00f1o, and in Brazil, it is a fixture in popular music styles as Sertanejo and Forr\u00f3. In art music it is used in jazz music, an important exponent having been the North American accordionist Frank Marocco and in transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.\n\n\n== Use in traditional musicEdit ==\n\nAfter the invention of the accordion in 1829, its popularity spread throughout the world, in no small measure due to the polka craze. \"Once the polka became a craze in Paris and London during the spring of 1844, it diffused rapidly to the rest of the world. . . . In March 1844, polka-mania took Paris: common people, servants, workers and, one assumes, anyone else who wasn't too stuffy were dancing the polka in the streets of the capital and soon in Bordeaux and other French cities as well. A week or so later it took London by storm. And from these two great centers of fashion, empire, and influence, the polka diffused rapidly upward into the rest of French and English society and outward to the rest of the world.\" \nExcept for a brief moment in time during the 1830s and 1840s when the accordion was heard by French aristocracy during Salon music concerts, the instrument has always been associated with the common people. The accordion was spread across the globe by the waves of Europeans who emigrated to various parts of the world in the late 19th century and early 20th century.\nThe mid-19th-century accordion became a favorite of folk musicians for several reasons: \"The new instrument's popularity [among the common masses] was a result of its unique qualities. Firstly, it was much louder than all the older folk instruments put together. It could easily be heard in even the wildest pub above the stomping of dancing feet. It was also the prototype of a 'one man band' with bass and chords on the left-hand side and buttons for the melody on the right, and you could still sing along and beat the rhythm with your feet. The instrument needed no tuning and was always ready to play, but the most ingenious thing about the early one-row squeezebox was that you couldn't play it really badly. Even if you lost the melody it still sounded fine.\" \nSince its invention, the accordion has become popularly integrated into a lot of varying traditional music styles all over the world, ranging from the European polka and the Colombian Vallenato to Korean trot music. See the list of traditional music styles that incorporate the accordion. Although rarely seen many early bigband (swing bands like Glenn Miller's) scores have the Piano part marked \"Piano/Piano Accordion\"\nSometimes, certain traditional music styles may even be tied to a certain type of accordion, like the Schrammel accordion for Schrammelmusik, the Trikitixa for Basque music, or the diatonic button accordion in Mexican conjunto and norte\u00f1o music. It would be hard to name one country in which the accordion did not play a significant role in its music tradition. It has even been idealized in literature.\n\n\n== Use in popular musicEdit ==\nThe accordion was heard frequently in popular music beginning around 1910 until about 1960. With rise of the popularity of the guitar (in particular the electric guitar) and rock music, the popularity of the accordion in pop music in Europe and North-America declined strongly. In some countries however, such as Brazil and Mexico, the accordion continues to be a fixture in pop music and its popularity is undiminished.\nThis half century is often called the \"Golden Age of the Accordion.\" Three players, more than any others, inaugurated this era of popularity for the instrument, all Italian immigrants to the United States: Pietro Frosini, and the two brothers Count Guido Deiro and Pietro Deiro. All three players were celebrities on the Vaudeville circuits and performed throughout North America, Europe and Australia during the age of Vaudeville. They recorded hundreds of 78 RPM records for the Victor Talking Machine Company, Columbia Records, Decca Records, Edison Records and Cylinders, and other labels. Guido Deiro was the most successful and famous accordionist during the 1910s and 1920s, and lived a life filled with celebrity, luxury, fast cars, and fast women. Many popular bands, such as the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, employed staff accordionists.\nAfter most Vaudeville theaters closed during the Great Depression, accordionists still found work during the 1930s-1950s teaching and performing for radio. Charles Magnante is considered one of the greatest American popular accordionists. At the peak of his career, he played 30 live radio broadcasts and eight studio sessions each week. Another great popular American accordionist was Dick Contino, who toured with the Horace Heidt Orchestra and was billed as the \"world's greatest accordion player.\" He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show a record 48 times. In addition, John Serry, Sr. achieved national recognition on tour with Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm jazz orchestra during the 1930s, concertized on the CBS radio and television networks in the 1940s and 1950s and appeared in the Broadway Theatre during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1950s through the 1980s the accordion received great exposure on television with performances by Myron Floren\u2014the accordionist with Lawrence Welk\u2014on the Lawrence Welk Show. However, with the advent of rock 'n roll and the generation gap in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the accordion declined in popularity, as the younger generation considered it \"square\"\u2014 epitomizing the light-hearted music of their parents and grandparents.\nIn Europe and North America (outside of Mexico), in contemporary mainstream pop music (see youth culture), the use of the accordion is usually considered exotic or old-fashioned. Nevertheless, some popular acts do use the instrument in their distinctive sounds, and a 2014 Los Angeles Times article reports that the instrument is growing in popularity locally. (See the list of popular music acts that incorporate the accordion.) Since the late 19th century, Tejano music has emerged as one of the leading genres for the instrument in America. Pioneers such as Narciso Mart\u00ednez gave the instrument ataple in the cultural music of Mexican American people. Central to the evolution of early Tejano music was the blend of traditional forms such as the Corrido and Mariachi, and Continental European styles, such as Polka, introduced by German and Czech settlers in the late 19th century. In particular, the accordion was adopted by Tejano folk musicians at the turn of the 20th century, and it became a popular instrument for amateur musicians in Texas and Northern Mexico.\nThe accordion has been a primary instrument in Mexican music. It is mostly associated with Norte\u00f1o music, which has become one of the most popular music genres in Mexico since the 1990's, but the instrument is also featured in other genres such as Cumbia. Ramon Ayala is arguably the best-known accordion player in Mexico; nicknamed the \"King of the accordion\", Ayala has recorded over 113 albums since the 1960's.\nIn some countries, such as Brazil, the accordion is a fixture in maintstream popular music (evidenced by mainstream groups such as Falamansa, Michel Tel\u00f3, Avioes do Forr\u00f3). The instrument is commonly learned by teenagers and enjoys a popularity comparable to the guitar. In some regions (such as the North-East, where it is called sanfona), the accordion surpasses the guitar in popularity among the youth. In Brazil, however, the accordion uses normally a very dry tuning, which dissociates it from the wetter sound found in European folk music.\nThe instrument was also used in the Disney song \"Whale of a Tale\" from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, as well as Donald Duck's song, \"Quack Quack Quack\". It was used in a Christmas setting for the song \"Nuttin' for Christmas\".\nThe composer Tomohito Nishiura frequently uses the accordion in the Professor Layton series of games, for example in \"Laboratory\" or \"Don Paolo's Theme\". However, when 'Live Versions' of the soundtracks are released, the accordion is occasionally replaced (such as in \"London 3\" from Professor Layton and the Unwound Future). Every 'theme' for a game uses the accordion in some capacity.\nIt is a traditional instrument in Brazilian music, specifically bai\u00e3o of the northeast. Luiz Gonzaga is called the king of bai\u00e3o.\nVarious folk metal and viking metal bands, such as Finsterforst, Finntroll, and Turisas  that have formed in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century feature accordions.\n\n\n== Use in classical musicEdit ==\n\nAlthough the accordion is best known primarily as a folk instrument, it has been used with increasing frequency by classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece written for the accordion is Th\u00eame vari\u00e9 tr\u00e8s brillant pour accord\u00e9on methode Reisner, written in 1836 by Miss Louise Reisner of Paris, an accordionist and amateur composer.\nThe Russian composer Piotr Ilyitch Tchaikovsky included four optional single-action diatonic accordions in his Orchestral Suite No. 2 in C Major, op. 53 (1883), simply to add a little color to the third movement: Scherzo burlesque.\nThe Italian composer Umberto Giordano included the single-action diatonic accordion in his opera Fedora (1898). The accordionist appears on-stage\u2014along with a folk-trio consisting of a piccolo player and triangle player\u2014three times in the third act (which is set in Switzerland), to accompany a short and simple song which is sung by a little Savoyard (Alpine shepherd).\nIn 1915, the American composer Charles Ives included a chorus of diatonic accordions (or concertinas \u2014along with two pianos, celesta, harp, organ, zither and an optional theremin\u2014in his Orchestral Set No. 2. The accordion part\u2014written for the right-hand only\u2014consists of eighteen measures at the very end of the eighteen-minute-long three-movement work. All the above works were written for the diatonic button accordion.\nThe first composer to write specifically for the chromatic accordion (able to play all 12 notes of the chromatic scale) was Paul Hindemith. In 1921 he included the harmonium in Kammermusik No. 1, a chamber work in four movements for twelve players, but later rewrote the harmonium part for accordion. Other German composers also wrote for the accordion.\nIn 1922, Austrian composer Alban Berg included a short on-stage accordion part in his landmark opera Wozzeck, Op. 7. The instrument\u2014marked Ziehharmonika bzw. Akkordeon in the score appears only during the tavern garden (wirthausgarten) scene, along with an on-stage (B\u00fchnenmusik) ensemble consisting of two fiddles (violins tuned up a tone), one clarinet in C, one guitar and one bombardon in F (or bass tuba), to lend a touch of authenticity to the deutsche Biergarten setting.\n\nNotable composers who wrote for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century were:\nVirgil Thomson: Four Saints in Three Acts (1928)\nSerge Prokofiev: Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution, op. 74 (1936)\nPaul Dessau: Mother Courage (1936) and Die Verurteilung des Lukullus (1949)\nDmitri Shostakovich: Jazz Suite No. 2 (1938)\nJean Fran\u00e7aix: Apocalypse According to St. John (1939)\nDarius Milhaud: Prelude and Postlude for \"Lidoire\" (1946)\nHenry Brant: All Soul's Carnival (1949)\nGeorge Antheil\u2014of Ballet m\u00e9canique fame: Accordion Dance for accordion and orchestra (1951)\nJohn Serry, Sr.: American Rhapsody (1955), to name a few.\nIn 1937 the first accordion concerto was written and played in Russia.\nPauline Oliveros brought the accordion into the American expirimental tradition.\n\n\n=== The free-bass accordion in classical musicEdit ===\nDespite efforts by accordion performers and organizations to present the accordion as a serious instrument to the classical music world, the much-coveted breakthrough into the mainstream of serious musical circles did not take place until after leading accordionists more or less abandoned the stradella-bass accordion (an instrument limited to only bass and pre-set chord buttons on the left-hand manual) and embraced the free-bass accordion (an instrument which could play single pitches on the left-hand manual with a range of three octaves or more, similar to the right-hand manual). Composers found the free-bass accordion much more attractive and easier to write for as it liberated the instrument from a limited range of bass notes (only a minor seventh) and the pre-set chord buttons.\nDespite being invented as early as 1912, the instrument did not really become popular until the mid-20th century, when it was \"discovered\" by classical accordionists. The Danish accordionist Mogens Ellegaard, regarded by many as the father of the avant-garde accordion movement, described his introduction to the new accordion:\n\n\"When I started, there was absolutely no accordion culture. Unless, you define accordion culture as 'oom-pah-pah,' or the Cuckoo Waltz\u2014that sort of thing. The free-bass accordion didn't exist\u2014it was entirely unknown when I was a child. At that time the accordion world was living in splendid isolation. No contact at all with the outside musical world. Concerts for us consisted of Frosini, Deiro repertoire or folkloristic music. The possibilities of getting a formal, quality education [on accordion] were nil. The accordion was not accepted at any of the higher music institutions. . . . The possibilities for a soloist, for the best players, would be variety 'night club' work, Saturday night shows. . . . This is what I was doing when I was very young.\"\n\nEllegaard continued,\n\n\"But in 1953 the first free-bass accordions were introduced in Denmark and, by coincidence, I was one of the first students to get such an instrument. . . . In 1957, the pianist Vilfred Kjaer, who was also well-known in our country as a composer of light music, wrote a concerto for me and through his good connections, he was able to organize the world premiere of Jubilesse infameuse. It was a work of light character, but anyway a beginning. At that concert, also by coincidence, [the composer] Ole Schmidt was sitting in the audience. He didn't like Kjaer's composition, but liked the instrument, and told me this bluntly afterwards. So I challenged him to write something better. In 1958 he wrote Symphonic Fantasy and Allegro, op. 20 for accordion and orchestra, which was the first really serious work for accordion written by a good composer.\" \n\nSymphonic Fantasy and Allegro was premiered by the Danish Radio Symphony with the composer conducting. Ole Schmidt made the following comment about the work, \"I hated accordion until I met Mogens Ellegaard. He made me decide to write an accordion concerto for him.\" \nOther Danish composers soon followed Schmidt:\nNiels Viggo Bentzon wrote Concerto for Accordion (1962\u201363), In the Zoo (1964) and Sinfonia concertante (1965) for six accordions, string orchestra and percussion.\nPer N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd wrote Anatomic Safari (1967) for solo accordion and Recall (1968) for accordion and orchestra, which was dedicated to Lars Dyremose, director of the Danish Accordion Academy.\nKarl Aage Rasmussen wrote Invention (1972)\nHans Abrahamsen wrote Canzone (1977-8) for solo accordion.\nSteen Pade, N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd's student, wrote a concerto for accordion and three solo works: Excursions With Detours (1984), Aprilis (1987) and Cadenza (1987).\nVagn Holmboe wrote Sonata, Op. 143A.\nIn Europe, free bass accordion performance has reached a very high level and the instrument is considered worthy of serious study in music conservatories. Modern and avant-garde composers such as Sofia Gubaidulina, Edison Denisov, Luciano Berio, Per N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd, Arne Nordheim, Jindrich Feld, Franco Donatoni, Toshio Hosokawa, Mauricio Kagel, Patrick Nunn and Magnus Lindberg have written for the free bass accordion and the instrument is becoming more frequently integrated into new music chamber and improvisation groups.\nThe Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino (b. 1947) recently wrote a piece entitled Storie di Altre Storie, for accordionist Teodoro Anzellotti, requiring use of the free bass accordion in its instrumentation, and drawing off the keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti, the glass harmonica music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and the ballades of Guillaume de Machaut. It was well received by most European audiences and was released on a compilation disc of Sciarrino's other works on the Winter and Winter label. Young generation composers who have written for accordion include Christina Athinodorou (b. 1981) who wrote \"Virgules\" for Solo Accordion (2009) featuring the combined use between the stradella bass and the chromatic button system.\nIn the United States, the free-bass accordion is heard occasionally. Beginning in the 1960s, competitive performance on the accordion of classical piano compositions, by the great masters of music, occurred. Although never mainstreamed in the larger musical scene, this convergence with traditional classical music propelled young accordionists to an ultimate involvement with classical music heretofore not experienced.\nA number of American instrumentalists did succeed in demonstrating the unique orchestral capabilities of the free bass accordion while performing at the nation's premier concert venues. In the process they encouraged contemporary composers to write for the instrument. Included among the leading orchestral artists was John Serry, Sr. A concert accordionist, soloist, composer, and arranger, Serry performed extensively in both symphonic orchestras and jazz ensembles as well as on live radio and television broadcasts. His refined poetic artistry gained respect for the free bass accordion as a serious concert instrument among prominent classical musicians and conductors of the early 20th century. In addition, his Concerto For Free Bass Accordion was completed in 1966 and illustrates the vast orchestral potentialities of the instrument.\nRecently Guy Klucevsek has built a reputation on combining folk styles with classical forms and makes extensive use of the free bass. New York's William Schimmel, who composes and performs in many genres, is a leading exponent of the \"quint\" style free bass system and uses it extensively in tandem with the standard stradella system.\nIn Canada several performers also contributed extensively to the acceptance of the Free Bass Accordion as a respected member of orchestral ensembles throughout North America. Among the leading performers, educators and composers was Joseph Macerollo who achieved widespread acclaim as an interpreter of both contemporary and classical compositions for the instrument.\n\n\n== NotesEdit ==\n\n\n== ReferencesEdit ==",

            "content": "The Infantry Training Centre (ITC) is a unit of the British Army, administered by HQ School of Infantry and responsible for both basic and advanced training of soldiers and officers joining the infantry. The unit's headquarters are at Catterick, North Yorkshire.\n\n\n== History ==\nITC Catterick assumed overall responsibility for all infantry phase 2 training from the three Infantry Training Battalion sites at Catterick, Strensall and Ouston on 1 May 1995. As of May 2002, the ITC assumed full control of all infantry phase 1 and 2 training for the Regular Army in a single Combat Infantryman's Course (CIC). ITC Catterick is also responsible for the Infantry Battle School (Brecon), and the Support Weapons School (Warminster). ITC Catterick is the predominant user of the Warcop Training Area.\n\n\n== Training regime ==\nThe Infantry Training Centre (ITC) Catterick is the primary training location for all recruits who want to join the infantry and is where the Combat Infantryman's Course (CIC) is conducted. The CIC combines Phase 1 and Phase 2 infantry training (junior soldiers destined for the infantry continue to receive Phase 1 training at the Army Foundation College in Harrogate). ITC Catterick is divided into three Battalions of which two are Infantry Training Battalions (ITB) and one is a support Battalion (ITC).\n1st Infantry Training Battalion is responsible for training soldiers destined to join the regiments of the Queen's Division, Prince of Wales' Division, the Royal Irish Regiment and The Rifles, King's Division and the Royal Regiment of Scotland. The 1st Battalion has five training companies:Queen's Division Company\nPrince of Wales's Division Company\nRifles Training Company\nKing's Division Company\nRoyal Regiment of Scotland Training Company\n\n2nd Infantry Training Battalion has responsibility for training recruits who will join one of the regiments of the Guards Division, the Parachute Regiment and the Brigade of Gurkhas. 2 ITB is also responsible for the Phase 2 training for junior entry recruits from the Army Foundation College, as well as training for the infantry elements of the Army Reserve.Guards Training Company\nParachute Regiment Training Company\nGurkha Training Company\nAnzio Company\n\nThe ITC Support Battalion is the ITC's primary support unit, dealing with logistic and medical support. The battalion is structured to provide maximum support throughout the ITC and consists of the following departments:Headquarter (HQ) Company\nHook VC Company (discharged soldiers)\nGym\nArmy School of Ceremonial\nArmy School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming\nQuartermaster's (QMs) Department\nG7 Training\n400 Troop, Royal Logistic Corps\n\n\n=== Combat Infantryman's Course ===\nThe Combat Infantryman's Course (CIC) is the standard framework course on which all infantry training in the British Army is based. The standard course lasts 26 weeks, in which the basics of infantry soldiering are taught:\nPersonal administration\nWeapons training\nDrill\nFieldcraft\nFitness\nTeamwork\nBoth the Guards and Parachute Regiment have extended versions of the CIC that last an additional two weeks; new recruits to the Foot Guards undertake an extended Drill program as a consequence of the required standards necessary for them to undertake regular public duties, while the Parachute Regiment course has two weeks of additional fitness work. The course for new Gurkha recruits lasts for 37 weeks, and follows not only the CIC program, but also has elements of English language training and cultural orientation for new recruits to living and working in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "Actun Tunichil Muknal (the Cave of the Crystal Sepulchre), also known locally as ATM, is a cave in Belize, near San Ignacio, Cayo District, notable as a Maya archaeological site that includes skeletons, ceramics, and stoneware. There are several areas with skeletal remains in the main chamber. The best known is \"The Crystal Maiden\", the skeleton of an adolescent (an 18-year-old girl), possibly a sacrifice victim, whose bones have been calcified to a sparkling, crystallized appearance.\nThe ceramics at the site are significant partly because they are marked with \"kill holes\", which indicate that they were used for ceremonial purposes. Many of the Maya artifacts and remains are completely calcified to the cave floor. One artifact, named the \"Monkey Pot\", is one of just four of its type found in Central America. The Maya also modified cave formations here, in some instances to create altars for the offerings, in others to create silhouettes of faces and animals or to project a shadow image into the cave. The cave is extensively decorated with cave formations in the upper passages.\nAnimal life in the cave includes a large population of bats, large freshwater crabs, crayfish, catfish and other tropical fish. Large invertebrates like Amblypygi and various predatory spiders also inhabit the cave. Agouti and otters may also use the cave. These and many other species are quite common in river caves of this size in Belize.\nOther Maya archaeological sites in the vicinity are Cahal Pech, Chaa Creek, El Pilar and Xunantunich.\nActun Tunichil Muknal should not be confused with Actun Tun Kul in the Chiquibul Cave System.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe Belize Tourism Board, in coordination with the Belize National Institute of Culture and History, Institute of Archaeology, has granted licenses to a small group of agents to conduct tours to this cave, in an attempt to balance its protection against tourist revenue.\nThe cave is located in the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve. The main cave system is about 3 mi (4.8 km) long and consists of a long river passage for approximately 2 mi (3.2 km), which ends at an upstream sump. A series of upper prehistoric passages continues another mile past the sump through massive breakdown boulders and giant rooms. The cave can be exited through a tight squeeze ending in a giant sink hole collapse in the jungle. The cave's upper passage is located about 1/3 of the way in from the lower entrance. Here 14 skeletal remains have been found, and numerous examples of ancient Maya pottery remain.\nThe cave periodically closes when rainfall causes the river's water level to rise and potentially flood parts of the cave.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn late May 2012, a tourist accidentally dropped a camera and fractured a human skull estimated to be over one thousand years old. As a result, all cameras without a permit are banned from the cave. A different visitor once broke another skull by accidentally stepping on it. All visitors are told to remove their shoes and wear socks when reaching the upper dry chamber to help minimize foot traffic impact.\n\n\n== Media ==\nGhost Hunters International season 3 episode 9 \"The Crystal Maiden: Belize and France\" evaluated the ghost stories behind the mysterious maiden. National Geographic listed it as #1 on their list of Top 10 Sacred Caves.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaya cave sites\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nMarachov, Nick and Williams, Nick (ed) Below Belize ca. 1991.\nMiller, Tom Tunichil Muknal The Canadian Caver vol 21 no 2, 1989.\nWilliams, Nick An Introduction to Cave Exploration in Belize.

It accepts pupils from the surrounding areas including Edlington, Warmsworth, Tickhill, Loversall, Wadworth, Micklebring and Braithwell. Its feeder schools are: Warmsworth Primary, Edlington Hilltop, Edlington Victoria, Wadworth Primary, Tickhill Estfeld and Tickhill St Mary's.\nSir Thomas Wharton Academy operates a tutor group system. In the past groups contained pupils of all ages, but in 2009 new tutor groups were formed which included two to four members of each year group, including members of the Sixth Form. Form groups were then changed again at the start of the 2014 school year to include only students up to year 11. Sixth Form students now have their own specialised form groups.\nThe school operates a house system, introduced at the same time as mixed age tutor groups. All pupils and members of staff are separated into one of four houses. Each house has its own pastoral care team which deals with student issues. The four houses are named after country halls: Cusworth, Brodsworth, Chatsworth and Wentworth. Different coloured ties are used to identify to which house students belong.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Academy ===\nThe school gained academy status in February 2013 and joined the Co-operative.\n\n\n=== The Maltby Learning Trust ===\nThe school joined the Maltby Learning Trust in April 2017 and became known as Sir Thomas Wharton Academy. The Maltby Learning Trust is a Multi-Academy Trust with Maltby Academy, Maltby Redwood Academy, Maltby Lilly Hall Academy, Ravenfield Primary Academy and Maltby Manor Academy as partners.\n\n\n== References ==",

Over 7.5 million children and more than 10,000 schools across America have participated in Skyshapers University programs.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nEllie Dylan was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, but spent her formative years in Columbus, GA. She later explained that growing up in the Deep South during the Civil Rights Movement had a profound impact on her life.\nDylan left Georgia to attend Tulane University in New Orleans and spent her junior year abroad at the University of London. Returning to New Orleans, Dylan graduated with honors, Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude, from Tulane and was accepted by Tulane\u2019s Law School.\nDylan relates that during those college years, she experienced two life-changing events which shaped her future. The first occurred when her freshman English professor gave Dylan an \u201cF\u201d on a major paper she had written, explaining that she would continue to fail Dylan until she worked at her full potential. (This professor later bestowed the honor of Phi Beta Kappa on Dylan upon her graduation in the top percentile of her class at Tulane in 1974.)\nDuring her college years, Dylan was also a disc jockey on WTUL, the Tulane campus radio station, where she played music from The Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan, etc. and began to discover the power of the media to create change.\nDylan relates that her passion for radio became such that on every college vacation she attempted to get a job at a \u201creal radio station\u201d in her hometown, only to be told time after time \u201cWomen are not on the radio.\u201d\nFinally, the summer before she was to begin law school, Dylan was hired to do radio shows on WWRH-FM and WPNX-AM in her hometown. There she posed pointed questions to the likes of David Duke, Grand Dragon of the KKK., and Lester Maddox, controversial Georgia Governor, who is reported to have walked off her show. Thereafter, a local radio station employee told Dylan \u201cYou\u2019ll never make it in radio. Because you\u2019re different.\u201d\nSoon after, Dylan heard about a nationwide talent search for \u2018The Queen of Country Music\u2019 from WMAQ Radio (the NBC-owned Chicago radio station, which covers 38 states and Canada). Dylan sent in a three-minute biographical tape backed by Earl Scruggs banjo picking. Again, Dylan was \u201cdifferent\u201d and won the talent search.\n\n\n== Career and Success ==\n\n\n=== Radio (1975-78) ===\nIn 1975, Dylan moved to Chicago and accepted the job as \u2018The Queen of Country Music\u2019 at WMAQ Radio, a hefty salary, and a new surname  (after her favorite musician, Bob Dylan). By June of that year, Dylan was on the cover of the Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine, which called her \u201c82 pounds and 50,000 watts of down-home disc jockey.\u201d In her two years at WMAQ, Dylan turned her 7:00pm to midnight shift into the number-one rated music show in Chicago. She then became the first woman to do an afternoon drive shift on AM radio in a major market, and doubled the ratings in the 3-7pm slot.\nBy September, 1977, Dylan joined WNBC, NBC\u2019s flagship radio station in New York, as the first woman to hold a morning drive time shift on AM Radio in a major market. There, she replaced radio host, Don Imus. Although Imus had a loyal following, Dylan in her first rating book increased WNBC\u2019s morning audience and became the most listened-to female disc jockey in the United States. It didn't last though, as the switch to a more streamlined format was short-lived and Ellie was gone from WNBC within a few months.\n\n\n=== Television (1978-85) ===\nBut Dylan itched to broaden her horizons and set her sights on television, explaining that she wanted to \u201ccreate a kind of \u2018reality show\u2019 that is honest, clear, and alive.\u201d\nOn Saturday, September 30, 1978, Ellie Dylan\u2019s \u201cYou!\u201d show premiered on WABC-TV in New York and was subsequently nominated for three Emmy Awards. Called \u201cone of the best rating increase stories ever\u201d by WABC-TV, in February 1979, Ellie Dylan\u2019s \u201cYou!\u201d show became number one in the ratings and \u201cthe hottest show in New York television\u201d and won an Emmy Award.\nBy 1980, Dylan also began hosting and producing a series of one-hour \u201cEllie Dylan Specials\u201d in her first departure from the \u201cYou!\u201d format. Stints on other television programs followed: \u201cKids are People, Too,\u201d \u201cThe Love Report\u201d and later, \u201cThe Today Show.\u201d\n\n\n=== Multimedia Education (1985-Present) ===\nDrawing from her past when she was discouraged from becoming a radio disc jockey and then a television host/producer, only to succeed at both, Dylan next set her sights on developing entertainment to motivate children.\nIn 1986, Dylan started Skyshapers, Inc., a company to produce motivational entertainment products and programs for children. By August 1988, Dylan had also formed a 501(c)(3) public charity, the Skyshapers Foundation to develop and distribute children\u2019s motivational programs and scholarships. Along with creating 22 original cartoon characters and an original rock music soundtrack, Dylan put together an advisory board and forged alliances with the Department of Health and Human Services to develop a program that would motivate children by giving them \u201caction steps\u201d to reach their dreams.\n\n\n=== Government Partnerships ===\nAfter seven years of market research and focus groups with children, the Skyshapers Foundation program was endorsed by the U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Antonia Novello. It was federally funded and distributed in 20 percent of elementary schools in America, reaching more than 10,000 schools and 7.5 million children. It became one of the largest programs of its kind the Public Health Service has ever run in American schools.\nOver 14 million pieces of SKYSHAPERS materials were distributed to fulfill orders from 10,000 public and private elementary schools, and thousands of Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Clubs, Scout Troops, churches and synagogue youth groups in the United States. Inspired by the successful response to the Skyshapers Program, Dylan and her team began developing Skyshapers Textbooks and Teacher Editions; the first of which was The Sky Quest Series.\nIn 1999, Skyshapers became an official vendor for Textbooks and Teachers\u2019 Editions for the New York City Board of Education and Dylan began developing and delivering programs for the New York City School System, the largest in America with over 1 million students in more than 1,400 schools. In 2003, Dylan started SKY U, L.L.C., to serve as the production entity for the marketing and distribution of Skyshapers University products and programs.\n\n\n=== Quest For Excellence ===\nIn 2005, Dylan began The SKY U Quest For Excellence initiative in NYC schools, with Sky U and Skyshapers University producing and delivering SKY U Quest For Excellence Live Events for students, Faculty Training Seminars, SKY U Tracker Organizer Systems, SKY U Activity Sets, SKY U Incentive Cards, and Leaders\u2019 Curriculum Sets.\n\n\n=== Upcoming Projects ===\nDylan plans to continue The Sky U Quest For Excellence initiative in NYC schools and in other school systems across America.\n\n\n== Style ==\nSKYSHAPERS University programs are noted for their colorful cartoon characters and \u201chip,\u201d positive approach. They employ an intergalactic space theme with upbeat, contemporary music and child-friendly language. As Dylan puts it, \u201cI realized that after \u2018Sesame Street\u2019 and \u2018Mr. Rogers,\u2019 there is really nothing for the next age group that entertains yet educates. There is truly a void in hip, solid entertainment with a positive lifestyle message\u2026that gives children action steps, rather than a slogan, to achieve excellence and reach their dreams.\u201d\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Articles ==\n(June 22, 1975) Terry, Clifford, Chicago Tribune Sunday Magazine Cover Story\n(February 1980) WABC-TV Biography\n(October 11, 1992) AP Wire Service Story\n(November 9, 1992) Nick Chiles, \u201cTeaching Kids The Sky\u2019s No Limit,\u201d New York Newsday\n(September 1, 2007) Malcolm N.

With a land area of 0.6 km2 (0.23 sq mi), it had a population density of 120.0/km2 (310.8/sq mi) in 2016.\nAs a designated place in the 2011 Census, Schuler had a population of 63 living in 33 of its 44 total dwellings, a -22.2% change from its 2006 population of 81. With a land area of 0.57 km2 (0.22 sq mi), it had a population density of 110.5/km2 (286/sq mi) in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe settlement was named after Norman Banks Schuler, who settled a homestead in the area in the spring of 1910. In the fall of that year he was given the Post Office for the district. The hamlet itself acts as a service centre for people on the surrounding farms. Grain elevators were built by the Alberta Wheat Pool in 1924 and 1928 and by the Pioneer Grain Company in 1928. In July 1997, the last train hauled grain from the two remaining elevators. It is home to an ECS to Grade 9 school.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of communities in Alberta\nList of designated places in Alberta\nList of hamlets in Alberta\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The First Unitarian Church of Honolulu is the largest Hawaii-based congregation within the Unitarian Universalist Association. It is located at 2500 Pali Highway in the Nu'uanu Valley.\nThe congregation was founded in 1952 as a lay fellowship. The fellowship was unusual for its time because its leadership consisted of women (Rosemary Mattson as chairwoman and Ruth Iams as program director) and because it made efforts to engage in interfaith dialogue with Jewish and Buddhist congregations in Honolulu.\nIn September 1969, the church made national headlines when it offered refuge to U.S. service members protesting the war in Vietnam. The service members were arrested by military police within the church grounds. The resulting action brought about an unsuccessful lawsuit filed by the church against the military - Bridges v. Davis, 443 F.2d 970 (9th Cir., 1971). The private memorial service for Madelyn Dunham, grandmother of US President Barack Obama, was held there in December 2008. It is also where President Obama attended Sunday School during his youth.\nA new mission statement was adopted on April 15, 2012 to \"boldly grow compassion, justice, and joy.\"\n\n\n== Leaders ==\nThe Rev. Gene Bridges served the church from 1962 to 1970, responding to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s call to march from Selma to Alabama during the Civil Rights era.\nThe Rev. Mike Young was the church\u2019s minister from 1995 until 2009. After his retirement, the church went through a 2-year interim period, first under the Rev. Louise Ulrich from 2009 to 2010, then under the Rev. Leland Bond-Upson from 2010 to 2011.\nThe Rev. Doctor Jonipher K\u016bpono Kwong was called April 10, 2011. He began serving as minister as of August 15, 2011. Kwong is the church's first openly gay and first Asian-American minister since establishment. The Rev. Doctor Jonipher K\u016bpono Kwong resigned as minister June 30, 2015.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFirst Unitarian Church of Honolulu\u2019s web site",

            "content": "All Saints, Margaret Street, is a Grade I listed Anglican church in London. The church was designed by the architect William Butterfield and built between 1850 and 1859. It has been hailed as Butterfield's masterpiece and a pioneering building of the High Victorian Gothic style that would characterize British architecture from around 1850 to 1870.\nThe church is situated on the north side of Margaret Street in Fitzrovia, near Oxford Street, within a small courtyard. Two other buildings face onto this courtyard: one is the vicarage and the other (formerly a choir school) now houses the parish room and flats for assistant priests.\nAll Saints is noted for its architecture, style of worship and musical tradition.\n\n\n== History ==\nAll Saints had its origins in the Margaret Street Chapel which had stood on the site since the 1760s. The chapel had \"proceeded upwards through the various gradations of Dissent and Low-Churchism\" until 1829, when the Tractarian William Dodsworth became its incumbent. Dodsworth later converted to Roman Catholicism, as did one of his successors, Frederick Oakeley. Before his resignation from the post, Oakeley, who was later to describe the chapel as \"a complete paragon of ugliness\" had conceived the idea of rebuilding the chapel in what he considered a correct ecclesiastical style, and had collected a sum of almost \u00a33,000 for the purpose. He was succeeded at the chapel by his assistant William Upton Richards.\nIn 1845, Alexander Beresford Hope realised that the chapel rebuilding scheme could be combined with the project of the Cambridge Camden Society to found a model church. His proposal met with the approval of Upton Richards, George Chandler, rector of All Souls, and Charles James Blomfield, the Bishop of London. It was decided that the architectural and ecclesiological aspects of the project would be put entirely under the control of the Cambridge Camden Society, who appointed Sir Stephen Glynne and Beresford Hope to oversee the work. In the event, Glynne was unable to take an active part, and Beresford Hope took sole charge.\nWilliam Butterfield was selected as the architect and the site in Margaret Street purchased for \u00a314,500. The last service at the old chapel was held on Easter Monday, 1850, and the foundation stone of the new building was laid on All Saints' Day of that year by Edward Bouverie Pusey. Services were held in a temporary chapel in Titchfield Street for the next nine years, until the new church was finally consecrated on 28 May 1859. The total cost of the church, including the site and endowments was around \u00a370,000; several large individual donations helped to fund it.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAll Saints marked a new stage in the development of the Gothic Revival in English architecture. Simon Jenkins called All Saints \"architecturally England's most celebrated Victorian church\". In 2014 Simon Thurley, the Chief Executive of English Heritage, listed All Saints as one of the ten most important buildings in the country.\nThe design of the church showed Butterfield (in Sir John Betjeman's words) \"going on from where the Middle Ages left off\" as a neo-Gothic architect. Previous architecture of the 19th-century Gothic Revival had copied medieval buildings. But Butterfield departed considerably from medieval Gothic practice, especially by using new materials like brick. Charles Locke Eastlake, the 19th-century architect and writer, wrote that Butterfield's design was \"a bold and magnificent endeavour to shake off the trammels of antiquarian precedent, which had long fettered the progress of the Revival, to create not a new style, but a development of previous styles\". The Victorian critic John Ruskin wrote after seeing All Saints: \"Having done this, we may do anything; ... and I believe it to be possible for us, not only to equal, but far to surpass, in some respects, any Gothic yet seen in Northern countries.\"\nButterfield's use of building materials was innovative. All Saints is built of brick, in contrast to Gothic Revival churches of the 1840s, typically built of grey Kentish ragstone. At All Saints, Butterfield felt a mission to \"give dignity to brick\", and the quality of the brick he chose made it more expensive than stone. The exterior of All Saints is employs red brick, heavily banded and patterned with black brick, with bands of stone and carved elements in the gate, the church wall and spire. Decoration is therefore built into the structure, making All Saints the first example of 'structural polychromy' in London.\nAll Saints is particularly celebrated for its interior decoration. Every surface is richly patterned or decorated; the floor in diaper patterned tiles, wall surfaces in geometrical patterned brick, tile, and marble, as well as tiles with painted decoration, large friezes executed in painted tiles, a painted ceiling, and painted and gilded timberwork behind the altar. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described the interior as \"dazzling, though in an eminently High Victorian ostentatiousness or obtrusiveness. ... No part of the walls is left undecorated. From everywhere the praise of the Lord is drummed into you.\"\nThe rear of the chancel features a series of paintings on gilded boards, within a delicately carved brightly patterened gothic screen, the work of Ninian Comper and a restoration of earlier work by William Dyce. The decoration of the Lady Chapel is also by Comper. The north wall is dominated by a large ceramic tile frieze designed by Butterfield, painted by Alexander Gibbs, and fired by Henry Poole and Sons, installed in 1873. It depicts a variety of scenes from the Old Testament, a central Nativity scene and depictions of Early Church Fathers, .\nThe stained glass windows are limited in All Saints due to the density of buildings around the church. The original windows were designed by Alfred G\u00e9rente but his work was not held in high regard and was subsequently replaced. The large west window, which was originally fitted with glass by Gerente in 1853\u201358, was replaced in 1877 with a design by Alexander Gibbs based on the Tree of Jesse window in Wells Cathedral. The glass in the clerestory dates from 1853 and is the work of Michael O'Connor, who also designed the east window of the south chancel aisle which depicts Christ in Majesty with St Edward Martyr and St Augustine.\nThe baptistery in the south-west corner of the church is noted for its marble tiling which features an image of the Pelican in her Piety in the ceiling tiles, a symbol of the fall and redemption of man.\n\n\n== Anglo-Catholicism ==\nThe church's style of worship is Anglo-Catholic, \"the Catholic faith as taught by the Church of England\", offering members and visitors a traditional style of liturgy, as advocated by the Oxford Movement of the mid-nineteenth century, including ritual, choir and organ music, vestments and incense. Fr Cyril Tomkinson (vicar 1943\u201351), rebuking a visiting priest who asked for the use of the Roman Missal, said \"the rule here is music by Mozart, choreography by Fortescue, decor by Comper, but libretto by Cranmer\". Masses are now generally according to the liturgy of Common Worship (with the High Mass on Sunday according to Order 1 in traditional language), while the offices are still prayed according to the 1662 Book of Common Prayer.\nAll Saints is not a Forward in Faith parish. It remains within the episcopal oversight of the Bishop of London, rather than the provincial episcopal visitor (the Bishop of Fulham).\nThe vicar is Fr Alan Moses, assisted by Fr Michael Bowie, Fr Gerald Beauchamp and Fr Julian Browning.\n\n\n== Incumbents ==\n1859\u201373 William Upton Richards\n1873\u201386 Berdmore Compton\n1886\u20131905 William Allen Whitworth\n1905\u20138 George Frederick Holden\n1908\u201334 Henry Falconar Barclay Mackay\n1934\u201342 Dom Bernard Clements OSB\n1943\u201351 Cyril Edric Tomkinson\n1951\u201369 Kenneth Needham Ross\n1969\u201375 Michael Eric Marshall\n1976\u201381 David Alan Sparrow\n1982\u20135 David Michael Hope\n1986\u201395 David Handley Hutt\n1995\u2013 Leslie Alan Moses\n\n\n== Services ==\nSunday\nHigh Mass at 11.00 am\nMorning Prayer at 10.20 am\nLow Mass at 8.00 am and 5.15 pm\nSolemn Evensong and Benediction at 6.00 pm\n\nMonday to Friday\nMorning Prayer at 7.30 am\nLow Mass at 8.00 am, 1.10 pm and 6.30 pm\nConfessions from 12.30 to 1.00 pm and 5.30 pm\nEvening Prayer at 6.00 pm\n\nSaturday\nMorning Prayer at 7.30 am\nLow Mass at 8.00 am and 6.30 pm (first Mass of Sunday)\nConfessions at 5.30 pm\nEvening Prayer at 6.00 pm\n\nWeekday Solemnities (please see notices)\nHigh Mass at 6.30pm\n\n\n== Music ==\nA choir school was established at the church in 1843, which provided music for daily choral services. The choir was widely recognised for its excellence and choristers sang at the Coronations of Edward VII (1902), George V (1911), George VI (1937) and Elizabeth II (1953) as well as at Victoria's Jubilees (1887 and 1897). Amongst its alumni is Laurence Olivier. The school closed in 1968, at which point the boys' voices were replaced by sopranos.\nThe present-day choir maintains the exacting standards of its predecessors, and is now led by Organist and Director of Music, Timothy Byram-Wigfield.\nThe repertoire for choir and organ stretches from before the Renaissance to the 21st century and includes several pieces commissioned for the church, most famously Walter Vale's arrangement of Rachmaninoff's Liturgy of St John Chrysostom and All-Night Vigil for Western-Rite Mass and Evensong respectively. Rachmaninoff heard Vale's adaptations during his two visits to the church, in 1915 and 1923, and pronounced his approval of them. They are still sung on Palm Sunday.\nAll Saints' organ is a superb four-manual Harrison and Harrison instrument with 65 speaking stops, built in 1910 to a specification drawn up by Walter Vale. It retains the best of the pipe work of its predecessor, the original and considerably smaller Hill organ. Though as big as those found in most cathedrals, it is perfectly tailored to All Saints' smaller dimensions \u2013 powerful, but not excessively so, sounding intimate when played quietly, and monumental when loud. Harrison rebuilt it in 1957, replacing the tubular pneumatic action with electro-pneumatic. Electrical blowers replaced the hydraulic blowing plant.\nThe tonal changes made to 10 stops in 1957 \u2013 like those made to many other organs at that time \u2013 altered the tone of the instrument, to a very limited extent, to a more 'classical' sound. Therefore, when the organ next required major restoration work, the decision was taken to try to restore the sound nearer to that of 1910: to return it to an 'Edwardian Romantic' organ. The completed restoration was celebrated with two inauguration concerts in March 2003.\nOrganists have included Richard Redhead, the first organist and remembered today as the composer of Rock of Ages and Bright the Vision, Walter Vale (1907\u20131939), William Lloyd Webber (1939\u20131948), John Birch (1953\u201358), Michael Fleming (1958\u201368) and Harry Bramma (1989\u20132004), many of whom wrote music for use at All Saints and beyond.\nDirectors of Music (selected)\nRichard Redhead 1839 \u2013 1864\nChristopher Edwin Willing 1860 \u2013 1868\nWilliam Stevenson Hoyte\nWalter S.

Schneerson, the Most Influential Rabbi in Modern History is a biography of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson authored by Joseph Telushkin and published in 2014.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nInitial reviews for Rebbe have been favorable.\nWriting for the Wall Street Journal, Dara Horn writes that \"it will appeal to those curious about the Rebbe's influence on public life, and Mr. Telushkin is particularly strong on the Rebbe's impact on Soviet Jewry, Israel-Diaspora relations and American politics\". \"To understand why he inspired so many, do yourself a favor and pick up this biography. You don't need to be a Jew or even be a religious person to learn from this monumental man.\" says Barl Weiss of the Wall Street Journal for NY1. In the Jewish Daily Forward Mark Oppenheimer writes, \u201cTelushkin offers a rounded portrait of life in the shadow, or the sunlight, of the Rebbe. We meet dozens of followers and hear their stories, get a feel for the texture of their devotion, for why they loved him\u2026 It is worth studying how and why his method worked.\u201d Booklist gave a starred review writing \"\u201cThe subtitle\u2019s claim that Schneerson was the modern world\u2019s most influential Jewish religious leader is proven throughout this highly readable book. Readers are left to draw their own assessment from the wide-ranging portrait.\u201d\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nNew York Times bestseller (Hardcover Nonfiction, 2014)\nPublishers Weekly bestseller (Nonfiction, 2014)\nWall Street Journal bestseller (Hardcover Nonfiction, 2014)\nWashington Post bestseller (Nonfiction, 2014)\nReuters bestseller (Hardcover Nonfiction, 2014)\n\n\n== References ==",

A War Museum will be constructed in the adjoining Princes Park area. The proposed National War Memorial and the War Museum will be connected by a subway. The War Memorial and Museum are expected to cost \u20b9400 crore (US$62 million).\n\nThe memorial will be made around the existing chhatri (canopy) near India Gate. The memorial wall will be flushed with the ground and in harmony with existing aesthetics. Names of martyrs killed in wars in 1947\u201348, 1961 (Goa), 1962 (China), 1965, 1971, 1987 (Siachen), 1987-88 (Sri Lanka), 1999 (Kargil), and other Operations will be inscribed on a memorial wall. Askingstance of foreign architects is expected to be taken. The Government is expected to issue a global tender for the construction of the War memorial.\nThe museum at the adjoining Princess Park will be largely underground, and connected to the chhatri area via a subway. The Princess Park, is a 14-acres area north of India Gate, with barrack-type accommodation, built during World War II, which since 1947 has served as family accommodation for mid level armed forces officers posted in Service Headquarters in New Delhi.\n\n\n== Responsibility ==\nThe National War memorial and Museum has been designated as Special Project. The task to ensure its \"timely execution\" has been allocated to SPECIAL PROJECT DIVISION, which is under Chief administrative Officer, Ministry of Defence. The task has also been entrusted with Military Engineer Services\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n2009\n\nIn the face of persistent demand from the armed forces and armed forces veterans for a national war memorial in the India Gate area, the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government constituted Group of Ministers' (GoM) headed by Pranab Mukherjee (before he became the President) to examine the demand for a National War Memorial.\n20 October 2012\nAfter 50 years, the government decided to mark the anniversary of the offensive by China\u2019s PLA formations from bases in Tibet, against Indian border defenses, on 20 October 1962, by solemn ceremony at the Amar Jawan jyoti, to honor Indian soldiers killed in the 1962 war. At the ceremony attended by chiefs of the armed forces, AK Antony, the Defenses Minister, announced that the Government has conceded the long-standing demand of the Indian Armed Forces for a National War Memorial, and that a national war memorial will be built at India Gate. He added that the group of ministers has cleared all outstanding issues on the matter and the armed forces will finally get their wish.\nOctober 2015\nCabinet passed the proposal to build the war memorial.\nMay 2016\nThe Union Cabinet, was apprised of the decision taken by the Empowered Apex Steering Committee (EASC) that Princess Park Complex would be the suitable site for construction of the National War Museum. As regards the National War Memorial the same would be constructed at \u2018C\u2019 Hexagon of India Gate as approved by the Cabinet in its meeting held in October, 2015.

            "content": "Northern Alberta is a region located in the Canadian province of Alberta.\nIts primary industry is oil and gas, with large heavy oil reserves being exploited at the Athabasca oil sands and Wabasca area in the east of the region. Mostly natural gas is extracted in Peace region and Chinchaga-Rainbow areas in the west, and forestry and logging are also developed in the boreal forests of this region.\n\nNorthern Alberta encompasses census divisions 16, 17, 18, and 19.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region consists of aspen parkland in the south, grading to boreal forest and muskeg in the north.\nThe southwest of the region is part of the Peace Country, an area that stretches into northeastern British Columbia consisting of fertile prairie, ranchland, and farmland along the Peace River and its tributaries.\nNorthern Alberta is crossed by the Peace River and the Athabasca River, both of which eventually convene to form the Slave River that ultimately drains into the Arctic Ocean via Great Slave Lake and the Mackenzie River within the Northwest Territories. Other major rivers are Wapiti, Smoky, Hay, Chinchaga, Petitot Rivers in the west, Wabasca River in the center and Firebag and Clearwater River in the east. Alberta's two largest waterbodies, Lake Athabasca and Lake Claire are located in the wetlands of northeastern Alberta, forming the Peace-Athabasca Delta, that drains through the Slave River towards the Arctic Ocean.\nThe Caribou Mountains are an elevated plateau in the relatively flat Albertan north which provide core habitat for an endangered woodland caribou herd. This area is conserved by the Caribou Mountains Wildland Park. The adjacent Wood Buffalo National Park is Canada's largest protected area.\nOther tourist attractions in Northern Alberta include the Fort McMurray Historical Society-Heritage Park, Historic Dunvegan, Kimiwan Birdwalk and Interpretive Centre, Lesser Slave Lake Bird Observatory in the Lesser Slave Lake Provincial Park, Muskoseepi Park, and the Oil Sands Discovery Centre.\nNorthern Alberta contains several diamond bearing diatremes associated with kimberlite fields, including the Buffalo Head Hills and Birch Mountains kimberlite fields which in turn form the Northern Alberta kimberlite province.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\nHighway 43 and Highway 2 pass through the southwest of the region, this being the end of the CANAMEX corridor. Other important routes are the Mackenzie Highway and Bicentennial Highway in the northwest, the Northern Woods and Water Route in the south-east and Highway 63 in the east.\nGrande Prairie Airport, Peace River Airport, and Fort McMurray Airport are regional air transportation hubs.\n\n\n=== Health regions ===\nNorthern Alberta's health region is controlled by Alberta Health Services.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nOn a provincial level, northern Alberta is represented in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta by Members of the Legislative Assembly elected in the ridings of Athabasca-Redwater, Barrhead-Morinville-Westlock, Bonnyville-Cold Lake, Dunvegan-Central Peace, Fort McMurray-Conklin, Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo, Grande Prairie Smoky, Grande Prairie Wapiti, Lac La Biche-St. Paul, Lesser Slave Lake, and Peace River.\n\n\n== Communities ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of regions of Canada\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNADC - Northern Alberta Development Council\nTravel Alberta - Alberta North\nAlberta Regions - Alberta Heritage\nDiscoverThePeaceCountry.com featuring Villages, Towns, Cities, Parks and Lakes of Northern Alberta",

            "content": "Socket preservation or alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) is a procedure to reduce bone loss after tooth extraction to preserve the dental alveolus (tooth socket) in the alveolar bone. A platelet rich fibrin (PRF) membrane containing bone growth enhancing elements is placed in the wound or a bone grafting material or scaffold is placed in the socket of an extracted tooth at the time of extraction. The socket is then directly closed with stitches or covered with a non-resorbable or resorbable membrane and sutured.\nAfter extraction, jaw bone has to be preserved to keep the socket in its original shape. Without socket preservation, the bone quickly resorbs resulting in 30-60% loss in bone volume in the six months after dental extraction. The jaw bone will never revert to its original shape once bone is lost and tissue contour has changed.\nThe human body reduces the amount of bone that is not sufficiently used with a daily stress; without the strain stimulus, the jaw bone behaves (with or without socket preservation) as if the space occupied by the tooth and periodontal ligament was empty.\n\n\n== Membrane ==\nA platelet rich fibrin membrane is a membrane to prevent epithelial cell migration into the grafted area, it prevents bacterial colonization, contains growth factors (PDGF, IGF-I, VEGF, and TGFb) and living cells and allow perfusion of gases and recruitment of stem cells from periosteum. PRF is a second generation autologous platelet derivative of platelet-rich plasma.\n\n\n== Material types ==\nAutograft \u2013 Bone harvested from patient\u2019s own body.\nXenograft \u2013 Bone grafts or collagen from bovine or porcine origin.\nAllograft \u2013 Block bone graft from cadaver.\nAlloplast \u2013 Synthetic biomaterials such as fibrin scaffolds, PLGA, synthetic biodegradable polymer, hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, bioglass \u2013 ceramics etc.\n\n\n== Ridge augmentation ==\nSocket preservation differs from ridge augmentation; in socket preservation, the graft or scaffold is placed inside the tooth socket immediately after extraction, whereas the ridge augmentation grafting procedure is done to bring back the lost bone after the bone has resorbed and there is insufficient ridge height or width for further treatment procedure.\n\n\n== Benefits ==\nSocket preservation procedure prevents immediate bone resorption after extraction thus keeping the contour and integrity of the socket with successful and natural looking appearance for tooth restorative procedures. All dental prosthesis requires good jaw bone support for it to be successful in the long run. Without socket preservation, residual bones could lose volume resulting in loss of facial vertical and horizontal dimension and changes in facial soft tissues aesthetics.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGuided bone and tissue regeneration\nTooth regeneration\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBone augmentation and ridge preservation",

            "content": "ANSI C, ISO C and Standard C refer to the successive standards for the C programming language published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Historically, the names referred specifically to the original and best-supported version of the standard (known as C89 or C90). Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so helps portability between compilers.\n\n\n== History and outlook ==\nThe first standard for C was published by ANSI. Although this document was subsequently adopted by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, many programmers still use \"ANSI C\" to refer to the standard. While some software developers use the term ISO C, others are standards-body neutral and use Standard C.\n\n\n=== C89 ===\nIn 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. The standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 \"Programming Language C.\" This version of the language is often referred to as \"ANSI C\". Later on sometimes the label \"C89\" is used to distinguish it from C99 but using the same labelling method.\n\n\n=== C90 ===\nThe same standard as C89 was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only formatting changes, which is sometimes referred to as C90. Therefore, the terms \"C89\" and \"C90\" refer to essentially the same language.\nThis standard has been withdrawn by both ANSI/INCITS and ISO/IEC.\n\n\n=== C95 ===\nIn 1995, the ISO published an extension, called Amendment 1, for the ANSI-C standard. Its full name finally was ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 or nicknamed C95. Aside from error correction there were further changes to the language capabilities, such as:\nImproved multi-byte and wide character support in the standard library, introducing <wchar.h> and <wctype.h> as well as multi-byte I/O\nAddition of digraphs to the language\nSpecification of standard macros for the alternative specification of operators, e.g. and for &&\nSpecification of the standard macro __STDC_VERSION__\nIn addition to the amendment, two technical corrigenda were published by ISO for C90:\nISO/IEC 9899 TCOR1 in 1995\nISO/IEC 9899 TCOR2 in 1996\n\n\n==== Preprocessor test for C95 compatibility ====\n\n\n=== C99 ===\n\nIn March 2000, ANSI adopted the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. This standard is commonly referred to as C99. Some notable additions to the previous standard include:\nNew built-in data types: long long, _Bool, _Complex, and _Imaginary\nSeveral new core language features, including static array indices, designated initializers, compound literals, variable-length arrays, flexible array members, variadic macros, and restrict keyword\nSeveral new library headers, including stdint.h, <tgmath.h>, fenv.h, <complex.h>\nImproved compatibility with several C++ features, including inline functions, single-line comments with //, mixing declarations and code, and universal character names in identifiers\nRemoved several dangerous C89 language features such as implicit function declarations and implicit int\nThree technical corrigenda were published by ISO for C99:\nISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.1:2001(E)\nISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.2:2004(E)\nISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.3:2007(E), notable for deprecating the standard library function gets\nThis standard has been withdrawn by both ANSI/INCITS and ISO/IEC in favour of C11.\n\n\n=== C11 ===\n\n\"C11\" is the current standard for the C programming language. Notable features introduced over the previous revision include improved Unicode support, type-generic expressions using the new _Generic keyword, a cross-platform multi-threading API (threads.h) and atomic types support in both core language and the library (stdatomic.h).\nOne technical corrigendum has been published by ISO for C11:\nISO/IEC 9899:2011/Cor 1:2012\n\n\n=== Other related ISO publications ===\nAs part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes technical reports and specifications related to the C language:\nISO/IEC TR 19769:2004, on library extensions to support Unicode transformation formats, integrated into C11\nISO/IEC TR 24731-1:2007, on library extensions to support bounds-checked interfaces, integrated into C11\nISO/IEC TR 18037:2008, on embedded C extensions\nISO/IEC TR 24732:2009, on decimal floating point arithmetic, superseded by ISO/IEC TS 18661-2:2015\nISO/IEC TR 24747:2009, on special mathematical functions,\nISO/IEC TR 24731-2:2010, on library extensions to support dynamic allocation functions\nISO/IEC TS 17961:2013, on secure coding in C\nISO/IEC TS 18661-1:2014, on IEC 60559:2011-compatible binary floating-point arithmetic\nISO/IEC TS 18661-2:2015, on IEC 60559:2011-compatible decimal floating point arithmetic\nISO/IEC TS 18661-3:2015, on IEC 60559:2011-compatible interchange and extended floating-point types\nISO/IEC TS 18661-4:2015, on IEC 60559:2011-compatible supplementary functions\nMore technical specifications are in development and pending approval, including the fifth and final part of TS 18661, a software transactional memory specification, and parallel library extensions.\n\n\n== Support from major compilers ==\nANSI C is now supported by almost all the widely used compilers. Most of the C code being written nowadays is based on ANSI C. Any program written only in standard C and without any hardware dependent assumptions is virtually guaranteed to compile correctly on any platform with a conforming C implementation. Without such precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as GUI libraries, or to the reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of certain data types and byte endianness.\n\n\n=== Compliance detectability ===\nTo mitigate the differences between K&R C and the ANSI C standard, the __STDC__ (\"standard c\") macro can be used to split code into ANSI and K&R sections.\n\nIn the above example, a prototype is used in a function declaration for ANSI compliant implementations, while an obsolescent non-prototype declaration is used otherwise. Those are still ANSI-compliant as of C99. Note how this code checks both definition and evaluation: this is because some implementations may set __STDC__ to zero to indicate non-ANSI compliance.\n\n\n== Compilers supporting ANSI C ==\nAmsterdam Compiler Kit (C K&R and C89/90)\nARM RealView\nClang, using LLVM backend\nGCC (full C89/90, C99 and C11)\nHP C/ANSI C compiler (C89 and C99)\nIBM XL C/C++ (C11, starting with version 12.1)\nIntel's ICC\nLabWindows/CVI\nLCC\nOpenWatcom (C89/90 and some C99)\nMicrosoft Visual C++ (C89/90 and some C99)\nPelles C (C99 and C11.

From 1981-1982, he was a laboratory assistant at Lviv Polytechnic Institute. From 1982-1984, Chornovil served in the Soviet Army. From 1985, he was a member of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, and one of the founders of the Union of Independent Ukrainian Youth. From 1987, he was an editor in the \"Ukrayinskyi Vistnyk\" and the main editor of the \"Moloda Ukrayina\" newspapers.\n\n\n=== Political career ===\nFrom 1990-1994, Taras was a deputy of the Lviv Oblast Rada. From 1995 he was the main editor of the Chas newspaper. In 2000 and 2002, Chornovil was elected as a deputy to the Lviv City Council. From May 2002, Chornovil was a member of the Our Ukraine fraction of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament). During the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, Chornovil switched from Our Ukraine to the Party of Regions, a party that was antagonistic to Our Ukraine. In December 2004, Taras was the head of the Viktor Yanukovych election committee during the second voting round in the 2004 presidential election. In the Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006, Chornovil was elected as a deputy to the Ukrainian parliament as a member of the Party of Regions (he was 3th on their party list). On 28 November 2006, he was one of the only two Party of Regions MPs who voted in favour of the law recognizing Holodomor as genocide.\nIn October 2008 Chornovil left the Party of Regions. In June 2009 Chornovil was excluded from the structure of the Party of Regions faction by a decision of the political council of the Party of Regions.\nAfter the first round of the 2010 presidential election Chornovil called on Ukrainians to vote for Yulia Tymoshenko (with Viktor Yanukovych being the other candidate during that round).\nChornovil joined Reforms for the Future in February 2011. On February 9, 2012, Chornovil left that faction.\nIn the 2012 parliamentary elections Chornovil was a candidate in single-member district number 212 (first-past-the-post wins a parliament seat) located in Kiev; he became sixth in this district with 6.47% of the votes thus failed to win parliamentary representation.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPersonal Twitter thread",

It develops stand-alone electronic circuits, RFID tags (and readers), sensors and monitoring solutions. In addition it offers design services in several realms, ranging from microelectronics to custom IP solutions.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nEarly on, Pultronics delved in the field of optoelectronics. It explored how optoelectronic techniques can be used in the testing of integrated circuits (ICs). Other optoelectronics research focused on optical distribution systems  and on how packaging affects optical transmissions.\n\n\n== Pultronics today ==\nToday (>1998), Pultronics is involved in the RFID industry with its active RFID systems for long-range wireless data communications. Tracking of goods/assets through a cold chain is a typical usage of such systems. Pultronics is also active in the micro-transmitter system design including design of ASICs resulting in miniature sized active tags.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\nPultronics has contributed to the design flow of integrated circuits. Through the development of TED, an EDA thermal analysis tool of ICs, Pultronics provided an additional layer of verification to integrated circuit design. What makes TED different from other similar tools is that the thermal analysis is based on the physical topology of the IC instead of its schematic entry.\nPultronics has also contributed to the testing of integrated circuits with the development of independent modules that could be placed directly on the IC. Such modules typically provide valuable information on the performance of the IC without resorting to complex measurement setups. Traditional methods of IC testing can require measurement equipment which are costly (>10-100k$) and can also distort the measured information.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPultronics home page",

            "content": "Dark and Light was a pay to play fantasy MMORPG developed in Reunion Island by NPCube and published by Farlan Entertainment. It was released on June 6, 2006, to largely negative reviews. Though there was never an official announcement regarding discontinuation of service, the servers have been offline since 2008, ostensibly due to a lawsuit by VWORLD, LLC.\nSnail Games acquired the rights to Dark and Light in 2008 and developed a \"fantasy survival sandbox RPG\", which was released as early access in 2017 with the same name.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDark and Light was a third-person Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), set in a medieval fantasy world called Ganareth. Players could choose from 12 races, 10 of which could be either male or female (the exceptions being Half-Trolls, which were male only, and Fairies, which could only be female). There were 14 playable character classes to choose from, divided into four main archetypes: Fighter, Hunter, Healer, and Mage. Fighters were designed to have good defensive abilities and armour, and also had the ability to bring the focus enemies off of other characters and onto the fighter. They could be Warriors, Paladins, or Shadow Knights. Hunters were a support character, relying more on tactics and offensive support than on damage or defense. They could be Archers, Rangers, Bards, or Thieves. The primary purpose of Healers was to heal, as the name suggests, but they also had decent ranged damage capabilities. Healers could be Clerics, Monks, Druids, or Enchanters. Mages discarded personal safety in favour of large amounts of damage, in addition to buffing other players. Mages could be Illustionists, Necromancers, or Wizards.\nProgression in Dark and Light experience points gained in three separate systems, or \"axes\": Combat, Crafting, and Social. Combat experience was gained through defeating enemies, crafting from creating items, and social from joining guilds and doing guild quests.\nCharacters had 12 different equipment slots (head, shoulders, left and right arms, gloves, chest, shirt, belt, pants, left and right thighs, and boots) in addition to two weapon slots, allowing for one ranged weapon, one or two melee weapons, or a shield. Armour was divided into 6 types: robe, cloth, leather, reinforced leather, chain mail, and plate.\nCrafting was divided into \"jobs\", each specified by the items that that job could produce. Tanners made leather armour, tailors made cloth armour, armourers made chain and plate armour, blacksmiths made weapons, and jewelers made jewels, jewellery, and bracelets.\nThe world was split into Kingdoms. Each kingdom represented one of the Gods of the realm, who in turn were subordinate to Gothar: God of Gods.\nYsatis: Goddess of Fertility and Life\nAgnar: God of Sturdiness, Health and Death\nZephyr: God of the Divine Breeze, God of Speed\nHydra: Goddess of Mana(magic) and Heredity\nNeutra: Androgynous God of Charisma and Nature\nMalecta: Goddess of Wisdom and Sickness\nHel: God of Strength and Thunder\nCalder: God of Intelligence and Earthly Heat\nAesir: Goddess of Dexterity and Cold\nThe expansive game world was one of their larger selling points, offering 39,000 square kilometers (15,000 sq. mi.) of land to explore.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment on Dark and Light started by NPCube in 2002. Later, under the \"pressure from its investors and from the gaming community\", it was released underdeveloped to retail and on the internet in 2006 after a prolonged beta testing. On August 14, 2006, the publisher, Farlan Entertainment, stated that the game was released prematurely and has experienced problems due to its early release.\n\n\"Farlan Entertainment now acknowledges that the game was released prematurely due to pressure from its investors and from the gaming community.\"\n\n\"[We are] embarking on a new initiative to correct and improve various operational aspects of Dark and Light. While worldwide play in the Internet game will not be interrupted during this period, Farlan is nonetheless offering a thank you to the hundreds of thousands of Dark and Light subscribers who have signed on thus far by offering three months of play with no monthly subscription fee.\n\nFarlan Entertainment signed with SnailGame Entertainment, the distributor in China, to provide additional help with the graphics. All of the current subscribers were given a free 3-month period to play the game.\nFarlan also offered two payment schemes: free-to-play (after initial purchase) and $9.99 USD per month. Restrictions were imposed on the free-to-play account relating to character development with the intention being that a casual player may never be affected by the restrictions or it would take several months for them to hit the maximum level permitted by a free-to-play account.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDark and Light received largely negative reviews. Common complaints were the prevalence of gameplay bugs, low quality graphics, and poor overall implementation. Many reviewers liked the expansiveness and detail of the game world. MMORPG.com gave the game a 4 out of 10, saying that it \"offers a degree of freedom that is rare in online games\" but \"the game in its current state is broken, full of bugs and does not have half of what was promised\". GameZone gave the game 5.3 out of 10, saying that \"innovative gameplay elements are not enough to save a game that is fraught with concept flaws, lag and bugs and unfinished elements.\" OnRPG stated that \"this game had potential (yes... HAD). The whole idea of a 15,000 square-mile world would be marvelous to behold and the possibilities are quite profound\" but was still disappointed by prevalence of gameplay and graphics bugs, as well as losing gold when the character died\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nOn 27 April 2007 VWORLD, LLC brought a lawsuit against NPCube and Farlan Entertainment for \"software counterfeit, non-respect of the right to credit and paternity, unfair competition and parasitism.\" In September 2007, NPCube responded by suing VWORLD, on the grounds \"of unfair competition and damage to NPCube's reputation\", additionally claiming that instead of VWorldTerrain technology, they were using a technology called SCAPER, developed in-house by NPCube, and demanding \u20ac710,000 in damages.\nNPCube's lawsuit against VWORLD was dismissed on 13 March 2008. Additionally, NPCube was found to be using VWorldTerrain technology, not SCAPER, and was liable for \u20ac50,000 in damages to VWORLD.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial English Site via Web Archive\nVWORLD, LLC Official Site\n\n\n=== Dark and Light (2017) ===\nDark and Light (official website, US)\nDark and Light Facebook page\nDark and Light Subreddit",

            "content": "The thrifty gene hypothesis, or Gianfranco's hypothesis is an attempt by geneticist James V. Neel to explain why certain populations and subpopulations in the modern day are prone to diabetes mellitus type 2. He proposed the hypothesis in 1962 to resolve a fundamental problem: diabetes is clearly a very harmful medical condition, yet it is quite common, and it was already evident to Neel that it likely had a strong genetic basis. The problem is to understand how disease with a likely genetic component and with such negative effects may have been favoured by the process of natural selection. Neel suggested the resolution to this problem is that genes which predispose to diabetes (called 'thrifty genes') were historically advantageous, but they became detrimental in the modern world. In his words they were \"rendered detrimental by 'progress'\". Neel's primary interest was in diabetes, but the idea was soon expanded to encompass obesity as well. Thrifty genes are genes which enable individuals to efficiently collect and process food to deposit fat during periods of food abundance in order to provide for periods of food shortage (feast and famine).\nAccording to the hypothesis, the 'thrifty' genotype would have been advantageous for hunter-gatherer populations, especially child-bearing women, because it would allow them to fatten more quickly during times of abundance. Fatter individuals carrying the thrifty genes would thus better survive times of food scarcity. However, in modern societies with a constant abundance of food, this genotype efficiently prepares individuals for a famine that never comes. The result of this mismatch between the environment in which the brain evolved and the environment of today is widespread chronic obesity and related health problems like diabetes.\nThe hypothesis has received various criticisms and several modified or alternative hypotheses have been proposed.\n\n\n== Hypothesis and research by Neel ==\nJames Neel, a professor of Human Genetics at the University of Michigan Medical School, proposed the \"thrifty genotype\" hypothesis in 1962 in his paper \"Diabetes Mellitus: A 'Thrifty' Genotype Rendered Detrimental by 'Progress'?\" Neel intended the paper to provoke further contemplation and research on the possible evolutionary and genetic causes of diabetes among populations that had only recently come into regular contact with Westerners.\nThe genetic paradox Neel sought to address was this: diabetes conferred a significant reproductive (and thus evolutionary) disadvantage to anyone who had it; yet the populations Neel studied had diabetes in such high frequencies that a genetic predisposition to develop diabetes seemed plausible. Neel sought to unravel the mystery of why genes that promote diabetes had not been naturally-selected out of the population's gene pool.\nNeel proposed that a genetic predisposition to develop diabetes was adaptive to the feast and famine cycles of paleolithic human existence, allowing humans to fatten rapidly and profoundly during times of feast in order that they might better survive during times of famine. This would have been advantageous then but not in the current environment.\nThe hypothesis was proposed before there was a clear distinction between the different types of diabetes. Neel later stated that the hypothesis applied to non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In its original form the theory more specifically stated that diabetes may be due to a rapid insulin response which would prevent loss of glucose from the urine. Furthermore, it made use of a then popular theory which was later disproven. This argued that specific insulin antagonists were released in response to insulin with this causing diabetes.\nIn the decades following the publications of his first paper on the \"thrifty genotype\" hypothesis, Neel researched the frequency of diabetes and (increasingly) obesity in a number of other populations and sought out observations that might disprove or discount his \"thrifty gene\" hypothesis.\nNeel's further investigations cast doubt on the \"thrifty genotype\" hypothesis. If a propensity to develop diabetes were an evolutionary adaptation, then diabetes would have been a disease of long standing in those populations currently experiencing a high frequency of diabetes. However, Neel found no evidence of diabetes among these populations earlier in the century. And when he tested younger members of these populations for glucose intolerance - which might have indicated a predisposition for diabetes - he found none.\nIn 1989, Neel published a review of his further research based on the \"thrifty genotype\" hypothesis and in the Introduction noted the following: \"The data on which that (rather soft) hypothesis was based has now largely collapsed.\" However, Neel argued that \"...the concept of a \"thrifty genotype\" remains as viable as when first advanced...\". He went on to advance that the thrifty genotype concept be thought of in the context of a \"compromised\" genotype that affects several other metabolically-related diseases.\nNeel in a 1998 review described an expanded form of the original hypothesis, diabetes being caused by \"thrifty genes\" adapted specifically for intermittent starvation, to a more complex theory of several related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension (see also metabolic syndrome) being caused by physiological systems adapted for an older environment being pushed beyond their limits by environmental changes. Thus, one possible remedy for these diseases is changing diet and exercise activity to more closely reflect that of the ancestral environment.\n\n\n== Other research ==\nThe thrifty genotype hypothesis has been used to explain high, and rapidly escalating, levels of obesity and diabetes among groups newly introduced to western diets and environments, from South Pacific Islanders, to Sub Saharan Africans, to Native Americans in the Southwestern United States, to Inuit.\nThe original \"thrifty gene\" hypothesis argued that famines were common and severe enough to select for thrifty gene in the 2.5 million years of human paleolithic history. This assumption is contradicted by some anthropological evidence. Many of the populations that later developed high rates of obesity and diabetes appeared to have no discernible history of famine or starvation (for example, Pacific Islanders whose \"tropical-equatorial islands had luxuriant vegetation all year round and were surrounded by lukewarm waters full of fish.\"). Moreover, one of the most significant problems for the 'thrifty gene' idea is that it predicts that modern hunter gatherers should get fat in the periods between famines. Yet data on the body mass index of hunter-gatherer and subsistence agriculturalists clearly show that between famines they do not deposit large fat stores\nAs a response to such criticisms, a modified \"thrifty\" gene hypothesis is that the famines and seasonal shortages of food that occurred only during the agricultural period may have exerted enough pressure to select for \"thrifty\" genes.\n\n\n== Thrifty phenotype hypothesis ==\nThe thrifty phenotype hypothesis arose from challenges posed to the thrifty gene hypothesis. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis theorizes that instead of arising genetically, the \"thrifty factors\" developed as a direct result of the environment within the womb during development. The development of insulin resistance is theorized to be directly related to the body \"predicting\" a life of starvation for the developing fetus.\nHence, one of the main causes of type 2 diabetes has been attributed to poor fetal and infant growth and the subsequent development of the metabolic syndrome. Since the hypothesis was proposed, many studies worldwide have confirmed the initial epidemiological evidence. Although the relationship with insulin resistance is clear at all ages studied, the relation of insulin secretion is less clear. The relative contribution of genes and environment to these relationships remains a matter of debate.\nOther relevant observations arose from metabolism researchers who note that for practically every other species on earth, fat metabolism is well regulated and that \"most wild animals are in fact very lean\" and that they remain lean \"even when adequate food is supplied.\"\n\n\n== Other alternative hypotheses ==\nIn response to the criticisms of the original thrifty genotype theory, several new ideas have been proposed for explaining the evolutionary bases of obesity and related diseases.\nThe \"thrifty epigenomic hypothesis\" is a combination of the thrifty phenotype and thrifty genotype hypotheses. While it argues that there is an ancient, canalized (genetically coded) physiological system for being \"thrifty\", the hypothesis argues that an individual's disease risk is primarily determined by epigenetic events. Subtle, epigenetic modifications at many genomic loci (gene regulatory networks) alter the shape of the canal in response to environmental influences and thereby establish a predisposition for complex diseases such as metabolic syndrome. There may be epigenetic inheritance of disease risk.\nWatve and Yajnik suggested that changing insulin resistance mediates two phenotypic transitions: a transition in reproductive strategy from \"r\" (large number of offspring with smaller investment in each) to \"K\" (smaller number of offspring with greater investment in each) (see r/K selection theory); and a switch from a lifestyle dependent upon muscular strength to one dependent on brain power (\"soldier to diplomat\"). Because the environmental conditions that would facilitate each transition are heavily overlapping, the scientists surmise, a common switch could have evolved for the two transitions. The reproductive and behavioral dichotomy is not unique to humans. \"Hawk\" (aggressive) and \"dove\" (non-aggressive) strategies are known in animals. An aggressive soldier or hawk phenotype is associated with insulin sensitivity and dove or diplomat phenotype with insulin resistance.\nThe main problem with this idea is the timing at which the transition is presumed to have happened, and how this would then translate into the genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes and obesity. For example, the decline in reproductive investment in human societies (the so-called r to K shift) has occurred far too recently to have been caused by a change in genetics.\nAn alternative idea to explain the greater prevalence of diabetes in more northerly populations was suggested by Moalem et al. who noted that recent animal research has uncovered the importance of the generation of elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives as a physiological means for cold adaptation. High concentrations of these substances depress the freezing point of body fluids and prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells through supercooling, thus acting as a cryoprotectant or antifreeze for vital organs as well as in their muscle tissue. They consequently suggested that factors predisposing to elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives may have been selected for, in part, as adaptive measures in exceedingly cold climates. The authors suggest that this cryoprotective adaptation would have protected ancestral northern Europeans from the effects of suddenly increasingly colder climates, such as those believed to have arisen around 14,000 years ago and culminating in the Younger Dryas. A major issue with this whole idea, however, is that glucose, gycerol and sugar derivatives only become useful as cryoprotectants as the body temperature falls to the point where tissues are at risk of freezing \u2013 which is below 0 oC. Since no human ever survived a period of hypothermia with a body temperature less than 10 oC, because of heart failure, there is no possibility that this could ever have provided any selective advantage in our past history \u2013 no matter how cold the external temperature was.\nSellayah and colleagues have postulated an 'Out of Africa' theory to explain the evolutionary origins of obesity. The theory cites diverse ethnic based differences in obesity susceptibility in western civilizations to contend that, neither the thrifty or drifty gene hypotheses can explain the demographics of the modern obesity crisis. Although the arguments against these patterns arising due to 'drift' are unclear. Sellayah et al. argue that ethnic groups whose ancestors were adapted to hot climates have low metabolic rates due to lack of thermogenic capacity, whereas those groups whose ancestors were cold-adapted were endowed with greater thermogenic capacity and higher metabolic rates. Sellayah and colleagues provide evidence of thermogenic capacity, metabolic rates and obesity prevalence in various indigenous populations in support of their argument. Contrasting this analysis however a study of the spatial distribution of obesity across the mainland USA showed that once the effects of poverty and race were accounted for there was no association between ambient temperature and obesity rates.\nThe most highly cited alternative to the thrifty gene hypothesis is the drifty gene hypothesis proposed by the British biologist John Speakman. This idea differs fundamentally from all the other ideas in that it does not propose any selective advantage for the obese state, either now or in the past.The main feature of this hypothesis is that the current pattern of obesity does not suggest that obesity has been under strong positive selection for a protracted period of time. It is argued instead that the obesity comes about because of genetic drift in the genes controlling the upper limit on our body fatness. Such drift may have started because around 2 million years ago ancestral humans effectively removed the risk from predators, which was probably a key factor selecting against fatness. The drifty gene hypothesis was presented as part of a presidential debate at the 2007 Obesity Society meeting in New Orleans, with the counter-arguments favouring the thrifty gene presented by British nutritionist Andrew Prentice. The main thrust of Prentice's argument against the drifty gene idea is that Speakman's critique of the thrifty gene hypothesis ignores the huge impact that famines have on fertility. It is argued by Prentice that famine may actually have only been a force driving evolution of thrifty genes for the past 15,000 years or so (since the invention of agriculture), but because famines exert effects on both survival and fertility the selection pressure may have been sufficient even over such a short timescale to generate a pressure for \"thrifty\" genes. These alternative arguments were published in two back-to-back papers in the International Journal of Obesity in November 2008.\nPrentice et al. predicted that the emerging molecular genetics field would ultimately provide a way to test between the adaptive 'thrifty gene' idea and the non-adaptive 'drifty gene' idea because it would be possible to find signatures of positive selection in the human genome, at genes that are linked to both obesity and type 2 diabetes, if the 'thrifty gene' hypothesis is correct. Two comprehensive studies have been performed seeking such signatures of selection. Ayub et al. (2014) searched for signatures of positive selection at 65 genes linked to type 2 diabetes, and Wang and Speakman (2016) searched for signatures of selection at 115 genes linked to obesity. In both cases there was no evidence for such selection signatures at a higher rate than in random genes selected for matched GC content and recombination rate. These two papers provide strong evidence against the thrifty gene idea, and indeed against any adaptive explanation which relies on selection during our recent evolutionary history, but rather provide strong support the 'drifty gene' interpretation.\n\n\n== Search for thrifty genes ==\nMany attempts have been made to search for one or more genes contributing to thrift. Modern tools of genome wide association studies have revealed many genes with small effects associated with obesity or type 2 diabetes but all of them together explain only between 1.4 and 10% of population variance. This leaves a large gap between the pregenomic and emerging genomic estimates of heritability of obesity and Type 2 diabetes: sometimes called the 'missing heritability'. The reasons for this discrepancy are not completely understood. A likely possibility is that the missing heritability is explained by rare variants of large effect that are found only in limited populations. These would be impossible to detect by standard whole genome sequencing approaches even with hundreds of thousands of participants. The extreme endpoint of this distribution are the so-called 'monogenic' obesities where most of the impact on body weight can be tied to a mutation in a single gene that runs in a single family. The classic example of such a genetic effect is the presence of mutations in the leptin gene.\nAn important unanswered question is whether such rare variants exist because of chance mutations, population founder events and maintenance by processes such as drift, or whether there is any selective advantage involved in their maintenance and spread. An example of such a rare variant effect was recently discovered among Samoan islanders. Among the islanders the variant is extremely common, but in other populations it is extremely rare or absent. The variant predisposes to obesity but strangely is protective against type 2 diabetes. Based on cell studies it was suggested the variant may protect individuals against periods of 'famine' and there is also evidence that it has been under positive selection. The most likely scenario then is that this rare variant was established in the islanders by a founder effect among a small initial colonising population, and was able to spread because of a selective advantage it conferred within that small group. Hence, in small populations under particular environmental conditions it may be feasible that the 'thrifty gene' idea is correct. It remains to be seen if rare variants that fill the gap in the missing heritability estimates are also 'thrifty genes' or if they are rare chance events sustained by drift, as implicated for the common variants currently linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGenetics of obesity\nNew World Syndrome\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The Blum\u2013Byrnes agreements (in French accord Blum-Byrnes) were a series of commercial French-American agreements, signed May 28, 1946, by the Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and representatives of the French government L\u00e9on Blum and, especially, Jean Monnet. The agreements aimed to eradicate France\u2019s debt to America and obtain new credit in exchange for opening France\u2019s markets to American products, especially film productions.\n\n\n== Pre-agreement conditions ==\nFrench cinema was protected against foreign competition by a numerical quota system limiting the number of foreign films shown per year. Between 1936 and 1940, only 188 foreign (mostly American) films were allowed each year. Starting from 1940, films from non-Axis countries were banned under the German Occupation. The French cinema industry flourished under these conditions and in 1945 was the second-largest industry (in terms of employment numbers) in France, second only to the railways. Meanwhile, the overall economy of France faltered in the post-war years. The economy reached an all-time low by the summer of 1947.\n\n\n== Provisions ==\nThe agreement erased the 2.8 billion dollars France owed the U.S., chiefly from World War I loans and loans in 1939\u201340. Monnet set out the French five-year plan for recovery and development. The U.S. loaned France $650 million at low interest through the Export-Import Bank. The loan was followed in 1948 by a free grant of $2.3 billion from the Marshall Plan, with no repayment. In exchange, French cinemas would replace the numerical quota with a \u201cscreen quota\u201d. This meant that French cinemas were required to show French-made films for four weeks out of every thirteen and leave the other nine weeks of every quarter open to free competition, namely from American films.\n\n\n=== Amendments and Related Legislation ===\nOn September 23, 1948, the National Assembly revised the agreements so that French cinema had to reserve five weeks out of every thirteen weeks for French-made films. Numerical quotas were also reintroduced. 121 dubbed American films and 65 other foreign films were permitted each year with exceptions for countries that made significant efforts to import and distribute French films. The revisions also called for extra state aid to the French film industry. This request for financial aid was realized on September 23, 1948, with the introduction of a new program where taxes were imposed on movie tickets and the tax revenues were distributed to French film producers. In this way, American film sales helped the French film industry.\n\n\n== French reception ==\nPoliticians, the movie industry, and the press cried out at the Blum-Byrnes loan\u2019s condition of international free market competition in the French film industry. They argued that the American productions would hurt an already war-injured French film industry. With the backlog of over 2000 American films that were banned during the German Occupation, American films were able to quickly flood the French cinemas. Committees for the Defense of the French Film were organized to draw attention to the argument that the agreement\u2019s motive was to make France a \u201cfree market\u201d for dumping US films. On January 4, 1948, a demonstration of thousands of technicians, writers, and actors including Simone Signoret, Jean Marais, Raymond Bussieres, Madeleine Sologne, Jacques Becker, and Louis Daquin was organized and led to the subsequent revision of the agreements (as discussed in the previous section). The Center national de la cinematographie was created on October 25, 1946, to help organize and finance the French film industry. The CNC made several efforts to help support the French cinemas, including the tax program introduced in September 1948 (as discussed in the previous section). Franco-Italian agreements were signed to increase coproduction between the two countries. These coproduced films began to flourish after 1946. The Blum-Byrnes loan also awarded the French less than they wanted, and less than the British had received, further complicating Franco-American relations. Overall, the French saw the agreement as a threat to their film industry and acted to mitigate the agreement\u2019s effects.\n\n\n== American reception ==\nThe agreement was seen as a way to \u201cspread the American way of life\u201d though a war-torn France (and Europe at large) at the onset of the Cold War. It was also an effective way to promote free trade and the Hollywood industry. The US government also envisioned that these measures would eliminate all protection of the French film industry once the industry has recovered its competitiveness. The agreements were impactful and allowed for large numbers of American films to be shown in France. In the first half of 1947, 340 American films were shown compared to 40 French ones. Many American films had already amortized their costs during the period when they were banned in France and were thus able to be sold cheaply abroad for more profit. To further the cultural propagation effect of the Blum\u2013Byrnes agreements, the informational Media Guaranty Program was established in 1948 as part of the Economic Cooperation Administration to \u201cguarantee that the US government would convert certain foreign currencies into dollars at attractive rates, provided the information materials earning the moneys reflected appropriate elements of American life\u201d. This allowed American films to be shown to an even broader audience. The US gained a total of 16 million dollars from this program.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMagairaz, Michel. \"Autour des Accords Blum-Byrnes: Jean Monnet entre le Consensus National et le Consensus Atlantique,\" ['The Blum-Byrnes accords: Jean Monnet between national consensus and Atlantic consensus'] Histoire, \u00c9conomie et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (1982) Issue 3, pp 439\u2013470, in French\n1948: French Films : IN OUR PAGES:100, 75 AND 50 YEARS AGO.\" New York Times 6 Feb. 1998: n. pag.

            "content": "The GAA Hurling Under-21 All-Ireland Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as the Bord G\u00e1is Energy GAA Hurling Under-21 All-Ireland Championship) is an annual inter-county hurling competition organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). It is the highest inter-county hurling competition for male players under the age of 21 in Ireland, and has been contested every year since the 1964 championship.\nThe final, currently held on the fourth Sunday in August, serves as the culmination of a series of games played during the summer months, and the results determine which team receives the James Nowlan Cup. The All-Ireland Championship has always been played on a straight knockout basis whereby once a team loses they are eliminated from the championship, however, as of 2018 the qualification procedures for the championship have changed. Currently, qualification is limited to teams competing in the Leinster Championship and the Munster Championship.\nFour teams currently participate in the All-Ireland Championship, with the most successful teams coming from the province of Munster. Teams representing this province have won a total of 32 All-Ireland titles.\nThe title has been won by 8 different teams, 7 of whom have won the title more than once. The all-time record-holders are Cork and Kilkenny, who have each won the championship on 11 occasions. Limerick are the current holders.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Creation ===\nSince 1962, the Munster Council had been organising a provincial championship for under-21 players in Gaelic football. This championship proved successful in bridging the gap between the minor and senior grades in a way in which the junior championship had failed to do. At the GAA's annual Congress in April 1963, the Kerry County Board introduced a successful motion in favour of extending the provincial championship to All-Ireland level. It was the fifth All-Ireland championship to be created after the corresponding championships in senior (1887), junior (1912), minor (1928) and intermediate (1961).\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe inaugural All-Ireland Championship in 1964 used a provincial format. 16 teams contested the respective championships in Leinster and Munster, with Tipperary and Wexford emerging as the respective champions. Roscommon and Antrim were the respective unopposed representatives from Connacht and Ulster.\nAntrim and Wexford contested the very first championship match on Sunday 2 August 1964 at Casement Park, Belfast. The inaugural All-Ireland final took place on 4 October 1964, with Tipperary defeating Wexford to take the title.\n\n\n=== Proposed changes ===\nIn 2008 a radical motion was brought before a special Congress in an effort to combat player burnout. It was proposed to merge the existing under-21 and minor championships to create a new All-Ireland Under-19 Hurling Championship. This motion was defeated by 115 votes to 58.\nA similar motion was later introduced in an effort to lower the age and create a new All-Ireland Under-20 Championship, however, this motion was also defeated.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nLike the corresponding championships at senior and minor levels, Leinster and Munster teams grew to become the most dominant, as Gaelic football was the more dominant sport in Ulster and Connacht. After leaving the Munster Championship in 1970, Galway became the only credible team in Connacht and was essentially given an automatic pass to the All-Ireland semi-final every year.\nAfter the introduction of the \"back door\" system in the senior and minor championships in 1997, the under-21 championship remained as the last true straight knock-out championship. This changed following a Central Council motion to alter the format of the championship was endorsed by a Special Congress on 30 September 2017. The proposal to allow Galway and Ulster teams as agreed by the Leinster and Ulster Councils into the Leinster Championship was backed by 72% of delegates. The original recommendation would have ended All-Ireland semi-finals as the Munster winners were set to face off against the Leinster victors from next year. However, Cork argued that they should be retained with the Munster champions taking on the runners-up in Leinster and vice-versa. Their idea was endorsed by 78% of delegates. The new format will be used for the first time in 2018.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\n\n=== Qualification ===\n\n\n=== Championship ===\nThere are four teams in the All-Ireland Championship. During the course of a championship season three games are played comprising two semi-finals and a final. The championship is played as a single-elimination tournament. Each game is played as a single leg.\n\n\n== Venues ==\n\n\n=== Attendances ===\nStadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for the GAA and for the teams involved. For the 2017 championship, the average attendances for the three games was 7,336 with a total aggregate attendance figure of 22,009.\n\n\n=== Semi-finals ===\nThe All-Ireland semi-finals have been played exclusively at Semple Stadium in Thurles since 2011. Both semi-finals are usually played on the same day as part of a double-header of games. Semple Stadium had been regularly used as a semi-final venue prior to this, however, a number of other stadiums around the country were also used. P\u00e1irc Esler in Newry and P\u00e1irc Tailteann in Navan were regularly used for semi-finals involving a Leinster-Ulster pairing. Parnell Park in Dublin was used on a number of occasions for Munster-Ulster clashes, while O'Connor Park in Tullamore was a regular venue for Connacht-Munster and Connacht-Leinster meetings.\n\n\n=== Final ===\nSince 2010, Semple Stadium in Thurles has been the regular venue for the All-Ireland final. Prior to this, Semple Stadium had hosted the All-Ireland final on 12 previous occasions. Other stadiums which hosted the All-Ireland final include Walsh Park (8 times), Croke Park (7 times), Nowlan Park (5 times), Gaelic Grounds (5 times) and O'Connor Park (3 times).\n\n\n== Trophy and medals ==\n\nAt the end of the All-Ireland final, the winning team is presented with a trophy. The cup is held by the winning team until the following year's final. Traditionally, the presentation is made at a special rostrum in stand where GAA and political dignitaries and special guests view the match.\nThe cup is decorated with ribbons in the colours of the winning team. During the game the cup actually has both teams' sets of ribbons attached and the runners-up ribbons are removed before the presentation. The winning captain accepts the cup on behalf of his team before giving a short speech. Individual members of the winning team then have an opportunity to come to the rostrum to lift the cup. The original trophy was known as the Cross of Cashel. Awarded for the first time in 1967, the trophy depicted the crucifixion of Jesus. P. J. Ryan of Tipperary was the first recipient. After nearly 50 years the trophy was retired following the conclusion of the 2015 championship. Diarmaid Byrnes of Limerick was the last captain to receive the trophy.\nIn 2016 the GAA established a new cup named the James Nowlan Cup. Born in Monasterevin, James Nowlan became the first Chairman of the Leinster Council in 1900. He was elected President of the GAA in 1901, serving in that position until 1921. As the longest-serving president, Nowlan was honoured as the GAA's only Honorary Life President.\nIn accordance with GAA rules, the Central Council awards up to twenty-four gold medals to the winners of the All-Ireland final.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nSince 2003, the All-Ireland Championship has been sponsored. The sponsor has usually been able to determine the championship's sponsorship name.\n\n\n== Finals Listed By Year ==\n\n\n== Wins Listed By County ==\n\n\n== Performances by province ==\nA representative of each of the four provinces of Ireland have made an appearance in the final match of the All-Ireland.\nTo date, Munster leads with 30 titles, followed by Leinster with 12 titles and Connacht with 10 titles. A team from Ulster has made the championship final just once, but was defeated by a Munster side.\n\n\n== Records and statistics ==\n\n\n=== By decade ===\nThe most successful team of each decade, judged by number of All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship titles, is as follows:\n1960s: 3 for Cork (1966-68-69)\n1970s: 4 for Cork (1970-71-73-76)\n1980s: 4 for Tipperary (1980-81-85-89)\n1990s: 3 each for Kilkenny (1990-94-99) and Galway (1991-93-96)\n2000s: 4 for Kilkenny (2003-04-06-08)\n2010s: 3 for Clare (2012-13-14)\n\n\n=== Gaps ===\nLongest gaps between successive All-Ireland titles:\n24 years: Waterford (1992-2016)\n15 years: Tipperary (1995-2010)\n13 years: Limerick (1987-2000)\n13 years: Limerick (2002-2015)\n12 years: Tipperary (1967-1979)\n9 years: Cork (1988-1997)\n7 years: Kilkenny (1977-1984)\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial GAA website\n\n\n== References ==",

Its primary use is in Enterprise Application Integration of heterogeneous and complex landscapes of an organisation, and thus enabling its easy management.\nAn ESB service is designed and configured with Oracle JDeveloper and Oracle ESB Control user interfaces. It is then registered to an ESB Server. The ESB Server supports multiple protocol bindings for message delivery, including HTTP/SOAP, JMS, JCA, WSIF and Java, using synchronous/asynchronous, request/reply or publish/subscribe models. Currently, the ESB Server does not support Remote Method Invocation.\nOracle Retail Integration Bus (RIB) Essentials should not be confused with Oracle Service Bus (OSB). ESB was developed by Oracle. OSB, formerly known as Aqualogic Service Bus, was acquired when Oracle bought BEA Systems. The two products are related and interchangeable.\n\n\n== Components ==\nOracle Enterprise Service Bus contains the following components:\nESB Server\nOracle ESB Control\nESB Metadata Server\nOracle JDeveloper\n\n\n== Features ==\nOracle Enterprise Service Bus application-integration features fall into the following categories:\nServer Capabilities\nConnectivity\nSOAP invocations services\nWSIF\nAdapter services\nFile/FTP adapter service\nDatabase adapter service\nJMS adapter service\nMQ adapter service\nAQ adapter service\nOracle Applications (OA) adapter services\nCustom adapter service\n\nDocument Transformation : XSLT and MFL\nContent-Based and Header-Based Routing\nTight integration with Oracle BPEL Process Manager\n\nManagement and Monitoring Capabilities\nESB Control, the central point for metadata and configuration changes that take effect immediately\nVisual representation of end-to-end service relationships\nMinimal overhead end-to-end message instance tracking and monitoring\nError Hospital - automated and manual means for individual and bulk message replays\n\n\n== See also ==\nOracle Fusion Middleware\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProduct page\nDocumentation\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technology/products/integration/service-bus/docs/Oracle-Service-Bus-SOD.pdf\nhttp://orasoa.blogspot.com/2008/11/who-is-best-osb-or-esb.html",

            "content": "The Ditadura Nacional (Portuguese pronunciation: [dit\u0250\u02c8\u00f0u\u027e\u0250 n\u0250siu\u02c8na\u026b], National Dictatorship) was the name of the Portuguese regime that started in 1928 after re-election of General \u00d3scar Carmona to the post of President.\nThe preceding military dictatorship period that started after the 28th May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat, is known as Ditadura Militar (Military Dictatorship). After adopting a new constitution in 1933, the regime changed its name to Estado Novo (New State).\nIt is considered that the Ditadura Nacional, together with the Estado Novo, forms the historical period of the Portuguese Second Republic (1926-1974).\n\n\n== Ditadura Militar, 1926-1928 ==\n\nThe military coup of May 28 easily seized power. Soon afterward, the dictatorship dissolved parliament, banned all political parties and instituted censorship. This process was plagued by instability as hardline military officers purged liberals and democrats from the institutions of the Republic. During this time no one clear leader emerged, as the dictatorship was led by a coalition of lower-rank military officers, some of whom were Integralists.\nAfter the republican Prime minister and President of the Republic resigned on May 30, naval officer Jos\u00e9 Mendes Cabe\u00e7adas J\u00fanior assumed both posts, but after conflicts with other coup leaders, he was forced to resign on June 17. He was replaced by General Gomes da Costa, who assumed the posts of both, Prime Minister and President of the Republic. Gomes da Costa was not devoted to the cause of establishing a permanent military dictatorship and, because of these feelings, was forced out on July 9 by General Ant\u00f3nio \u00d3scar de Fragoso Carmona who assumed both of the highest offices of the state. Carmona continued as Prime Minister until April 18, 1928 but retained the post of President of the Republic until his death on April 18, 1951. In 1927 there were several failed coup attempts from both, left and right wing movements. On August 12, 1927 junior officers barged into a cabinet meeting and started shooting. The Carmona government regained control of the government and imposed stronger military discipline, however, the attackers were not severely punished and were sent to posts in Portuguese Angola.\n\n\n== Ditadura Nacional, 1928-1933 ==\nCarmona organized a Presidential election March 25, 1928 and was elected for a five-year term. On April 18 he appointed Jos\u00e9 Vicente de Freitas as the new Prime Minister. Antonio de Oliveira Salazar was appointed Minister of Finances. The conflicts between the military officers and the National Catholic wing represented by Salazar increased to a point where the entire Freitas government resigned on July 8, 1929 and only Salazar kept his ministerial post in the new cabinet of Artur Ivens Ferraz. Salazar's influence began to grow at the expense of military officers who gradually lost their political power. After a conflict with Salazar in 1930 Ferraz was replaced by General Domingos Oliveira who allowed Salazar to play an ever increasing role in the nation's finances and politics.\nBy 1930 the military dictatorship had stabilized Portugal and the national leadership and state functionaries began to think about the future. The overarching question was \"In what form was the dictatorship to continue?\". The answer was provided by Salazar, who became Prime Minister on July 5, 1932 and in 1933 instituted the Estado Novo regime.\n\n\n== Timeline, 1928-1933 ==\n1928\nFebruary, The Comiss\u00e3o de Propaganda da Ditadura (Commission for the Propaganda of the Dictatorship) is created.\nMarch 17, The Police of Information of Porto and Lisbon are fused.\nApril 18, General Jos\u00e9 Vicente de Freitas becomes Prime Minister.\nApril 26, Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar becomes Minister of Finance for the 2nd time.\nGeneral Ant\u00f3nio \u00d3scar de Fragoso Carmona remains President of the Republic.\nAcordo Mission\u00e1rio (Missionary Agreement) between the Catholic Church and the Portuguese Republic, giving special status to the action of the Catholic Church in Portugal's colonies.\nFailed Republican revolutionary attempt against the Ditadura Nacional.\nThe Portuguese Communist Party's Main Office is closed.\n\n1929\nJuly 8, Artur Ivens Ferraz becomes Prime Minister.\nRoman Catholic religious institutes are again permitted in Portugal.\nThe Portuguese Communist Party is reorganized under Bento Gon\u00e7alves. Adapting the Party to its new illegal status, the reorganization creates a net of clandestine cells to avoid the wave of detentions.\n\n1930\nJanuary 21, Domingos da Costa e Oliveira becomes Prime Minister.\nThe Acto Colonial (Colonial Act) is published, defining the status of Portuguese colonies (Portuguese Angola, Cabinda, Portuguese Cape Verde, Portuguese Guinea, Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Portuguese Mozambique, Portuguese India, Portuguese Timor and Portuguese Macau).\nThe fundamental principles of the new regime are presented by Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar in the 4th anniversary of the 28th of May Revolution.\n\n1932\nJuly 5, Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar becomes Prime Minister.\n\n1933\nA new Constitution is approved in a referendum, defining Portugal as a Corporative, Single Party and Multi-continental country (in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania).\nAn authoritarian right-wing Dictatorial regime entitled Estado Novo is installed.\nThe Single Party Uni\u00e3o Nacional (National Union) is created.\nThe Estatuto do Trabalho Nacional (Code of National Labour) is published, prohibiting all free trade unions.\nA Political Police, the PVDE (Pol\u00edcia de Vigil\u00e2ncia e de Defesa do Estado; State Defense and Vigilance Police) is created.\nCensorship, particularly of the Mass media, is systematic.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Mykola Oleksiyovych Skrypnyk (Ukrainian: \u041c\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u041e\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0456\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u043d\u0438\u043a, also known as Nikolai Alekseevich Skrypnik, 25 January [O.S. 13 January], 1872 \u2013 7 July 1933) was a Ukrainian Bolshevik leader who was a proponent of the Ukrainian Republic's independence, and led the cultural Ukrainization effort in Soviet Ukraine. When the policy was reversed and he was removed from his position, he committed suicide rather than be forced to recant his policies in a show trial. He also was the Head of the Ukrainian People's Commissariat, the post of the today's Prime-Minister.\n\n\n== Ukrainian independentist ==\n\nSkrypnyk was born in the village Yasynuvata of Bakhmut uyezd, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire in family of a railway serviceman. At first he studied at the Barvinkove elementary school, then realschules of the cities Izium and Kursk. While studying at Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology, he was arrested on political charges in 1901, prompting him to become a full-time revolutionary. Originally member of the Saint Petersburg Hromada society, Skrypnyk left it and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Skrypnyk was eventually excluded from the Institute. He was arrested fifteen times, exiled seven times, and at one point he was sentenced to death. In 1913 Skrypnyk was an editor of the Bolshevik's legal magazine Issues of Insurance and in 1914 was a member of the editorial collegiate of the Pravda newspaper.\nAfter the February Revolution Skrypnyk arrived from one of his exiles to Morshansk (Tambov Governorate) to Petrograd where he was elected as a secretary of the Central Council of Factories Committees. During the October Revolution Skrypnyk was a member of the MilRevKom of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.\nIn December 1917, Skrypnyk was elected in absentia to the first Bolshevik government of Ukraine in Kharkiv (Respublika Rad Ukrayiny), and in March 1918 Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin appointed him its head. He replaced at that assignment Yevgenia Bogdan (Gotlieb) Bosch, daughter of a German immigrant. Skrypnyk was a leader in the so-called Kiev faction of the Ukrainian Bolsheviks, the independentists, sensitive to the issue of nationality, and promoting a separate Ukrainian Bolshevik party, while members of the predominantly Russian Katerynoslav faction preferred joining the All-Russian Communist Party in Moscow, according to Lenin's internationalist doctrine. The Kiev faction won a compromise at a conference in Taganrog, Soviet Russia in April 1918, when the Bolshevik government was dissolved and the delegates voted to form an independent Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, CP(b)U. But in July, a Moscow congress of Ukrainian Bolsheviks rescinded the resolution, and the Ukrainian party was declared a part of the Russian Communist Party.\nSkrypnyk worked for the Cheka secret police during the winter of 1918\u201319, then returned to Ukraine as People's Commissar of Worker-Peasant Inspection (1920\u201321), and Internal Affairs (1921\u201322).\nDuring debates leading up to the formation of the Soviet Union in late 1922, Skrypnyk was a proponent of independent national republics, and denounced the proposal of the new General Secretary, Joseph Stalin, to absorb them into a single Russian SFSR state as thinly-disguised Russian chauvinism. Lenin temporarily swayed the decision in favour of the republics, but after his death, the Soviet Union's constitution was finalized in January 1924 with very little political autonomy for the republics. Having lost this battle, Skrypnyk and other autonomists would turn their attention towards culture.\nSkrypnyk was Commissar of Justice between 1922 and 1927.\n\n\n== Ukrainization ==\nSkrypnyk was appointed head of the Ukrainian Commissariat of Education in 1927.\nHe convinced the Central Committee of the CP(b)U, to introduce the policy of Ukrainization, encouraging Ukrainian culture and literature. He worked for this cause with almost obsessive zeal, and despite a lack of teachers and textbooks and in the face of bureaucratic resistance, achieved tremendous results during 1927\u201329. Ukrainian language was institutionalized in the schools and society, and literacy rates reached a very high level. As Soviet industrialization and collectivization drove the population from the countryside to urban centres, Ukrainian started to change from a peasants' tongue and the romantic obsession of a small intelligentsia, into a primary language of a modernizing society.\nSkrypnyk convened an international Orthographic Conference in Kharkiv in 1927, hosting delegates from Soviet and western Ukraine (former territories of Austro-Hungarian Galicia, then part of the Second Polish Republic). The conference settled on a compromise between Soviet and Galician orthographies, and published the first standardized Ukrainian alphabet accepted in all of Ukraine. The Kharkiv orthography, or Skrypnykivka, was officially adopted in 1928.\nAlthough he was a supporter of an autonomous Ukrainian republic and the driving force behind Ukrainization, Skrypnyk's motivation was what he saw as the best way to achieve communism in Ukraine, and he remained politically opposed to Ukrainian nationalism. He gave public testimony against \"nationalist deviations\" such as writer Mykola Khvylovy's literary independence movement, political anticentralism represented by former Borotbist Oleksander Shumsky, and Mykhailo Volobuev's criticism of Soviet economic policies which made Ukraine dependent on Russia.\nFrom February to July 1933 Skrypnyk headed the Ukrainian State Planning Commission, became a member of the Politburo of the CP(b)U and served on the Executive Committee organizing the Communist International, as well as leading the CP(b)U's delegation to the Comintern.\n\n\n== Purged ==\nIn January 1933, Stalin sent Pavel Postyshev to Ukraine, with free rein to centralize the power of Moscow. Postyshev, with the help of thousands of officials brought from Russia, oversaw the violent reversal of Ukrainization, enforced collectivization of agriculture, and conducted a purge of the CP(b)U, anticipating the wider Soviet Great Purge which was to follow in 1937.\nSkrypnyk was removed as head of Education. In June, he and his \"nefarious\" policies were publicly discredited, and his followers condemned as \"wrecking, counterrevolutionary nationalist elements\". Rather than recant, on 7 July he shot himself at his desk at his apartment in Derzhprom at Dzerzhynsky Square (Dzerzhynsky Municipal Raion of Kharkiv city).\nDuring the remainder of the 1930s, Skrypnyk's \"forced Ukrainization\" was reversed.\nHe was rehabilitated in 1962.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPeople's Secretariat, the first government of the Soviet Ukraine\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nChernetsky, Vitaly (2002).

The base is defined as the first appearance of the trilobite Glyptagnostus reticulatus around 497 million years ago. The top, or the base of the Jiangshanian is defined as the first appearance of the trilobite Agnostotes orientalis around 494 million years ago.\nThe name is derived from Paibi, a village in Hunan, China. The GSSP is defined in the \"Paibi section\" (Wuling Mountains, Huayuan County), an outcrop of the Huaqiao Formation. The base is the first occurrence of Glyptagnostus reticulatus which is 396 m above the base of the Huaqiao Formation at the type locality (28.3895\u00b0N 109.5257\u00b0E\ufeff / 28.3895; 109.5257).\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Peoples Natural Gas Park is located near the Cambria Iron National Historic Landmark at the junction of the Conemaugh and Stoneycreek Rivers and there is a view of the Stone Bridge and the Johnstown Inclined Plane.\nLocated on 3.5 acres, the park has an outdoor pavilion that seats 600 as well as the adjacent Oilhouse that seats about 560.\nFunded by Peoples Natural Gas for The Johnstown Area Heritage Association.\nThe newly completed Peoples Natural Gas Park is the home of the AmeriServ Flood City Music Festival and many other special events produced by the Johnstown Area Heritage Association (JAHA) and other organizations. The park includes landscaping, new restrooms, pathways and new sidewalks, ornamental fencing and gates around the perimeter.\nThe music festival has been staged here with temporary infrastructure since 2004. The festival utilizes the 3.5 acre park, Walnut Street and the parking lots across from the train station. Located across the river from Point Stadium and beside the Cambria Iron National Historic Landmark, the Peoples Natural Gas Park provides a beautiful view of downtown Johnstown, including the Inclined Plane and the Johnstown Flood Museum. The park is bordered by the Johnstown Urban Greenway, and stretches to the Johns Street Bridge.\nThe historic Stone Bridge, which has been lighted in colorful, programmable LED lights, is located at one end of the park. Every evening the bridge is lighted for three hours, beginning with a 20-minute lightshow before settling into a static scheme chosen to reflect the time of year, holidays, or special events and observances. The bridge will be lighted during festival hours, starting at dusk.\nDevelopment of the Park\nSince the purchase of the park\u2019s land in 2004, the Johnstown Area Heritage Association has been working to develop it as a permanent home for the music festival and as a catalyst for more special events. On May 23, 2011, a naming ceremony was held to name the park for the Peoples Natural Gas Co., which has donated $500,000 toward the project. Construction began in fall 2011 and was completed in May 2012.\nThe master plan for the park is by L.R. Kimball. The master plan was developed with input from a study committee in 2005-2006, public meetings in 2006, and individual discussions with agencies that have supported the project or might use it. Primary contractors on the project are Wilson Construction Inc., Mervac Plumbing & Heating, Inc., Church & Murdock Electric, Inc. and JWF Industries.\nPark Financing\nA $2 million matching grant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Redevelopment Assistance Capital Project was awarded to JAHA in spring 2008 for the park's development. In 2011, the Peoples Natural Gas donation completed the match.\nSeveral other major grants made the project possible, including a $100,000 grant from the Katherine Mabis McKenna Foundation. The Johnstown Redevelopment Authority provided matching Environmental Protection Agency Brownfield Cleanup funds. Also, the Authority was instrumental in undertaking the environmental assessment of the park and obtaining PA DEP Environmental Clearance. A grant for design costs was obtained from the Community Conservation Program, Growing Greener Fund, administered by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Bureau of Recreation and Conservation. A $100,000 grant from Mark Pasquerilla assisted with initial improvements to the property, which included the removal of underground gas tanks and installation of utility infrastructure.\nOther donors to the park include William Polacek; the Southwestern Pennsylvania Heritage Preservation Commission; JAHA's Board of Directors; and other supporters and friends of JAHA.\n  \n\n\n== References ==",

It was published in ten volumes between 1854 and 1879 by Thomas Gee on his press in the town of Denbigh, Gwasg Gee. The general editor was John Parry, Gee 's brother in-law and lecturer at the College of Bala. It remains the largest paper publication in Welsh today.\nThe project cost about Gee about \u00a320,000. That was a huge sum at that time amounted to about \u00a31,000,000 in 2009.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe Encyclopaedia Cambrensis includes nearly 9,000 pages in double columns. While the number of articles relating to the Bible and theology is significantly higher than expected in such a reference work today, it also includes a large number of biographical articles, articles on Welsh history and literature, science, geography and other Celtic nations.\nAmong the numerous contributors were Owen Morgan Edwards and John Morris-Jones. The article that the latter contributed on the Welsh language was used as a basis for his A Welsh Grammar, Historical and Comparative.\n\n\n== References ==",

The southern terminus is at US 30 west of Ligonier. The northern terminus is at US 422 in Cherryhill Township on the border of Yellow Creek State Park.\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\n\n=== Westmoreland County ===\nPA 259 begins at an intersection with US 30 in the community of Millbank in Ligonier Township, Westmoreland County, heading north-northeast on a two-lane undivided road. The route heads through wooded areas, turning east into more woodland with some farm fields and homes. The road curves to the north-northeast again, winding northeast through more rural areas. PA 259 heads north-northeast through more agricultural areas with some woods and residences, curving northeast again as it crosses into Fairfield Township. The route winds through more farmland and woodland with occasional homes, turning to the north before curving northwest. The road heads into woodland with a few farm fields, turning north before heading northeast. PA 259 winds north through more wooded areas, becoming Midget Camp Road as it curves northeast and north again through woodland with some homes, becoming unnamed again. The road passes through the residential community of West Bolivar before turning east and crossing the Tubmill Creek into Bolivar. Here, the route becomes Market Street and runs north-northeast past homes. PA 259 turns east-southeast onto 2nd Street and passes more residences and businesses before turning north-northeast onto Market Street and passing under a low (9'4\") clearance under Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line. The road curves to the east and runs between the Conemaugh River to the north and the railroad tracks to the south, heading back into Fairfield Township. After curving north to pass under Norfolk Southern's Conemaugh Line, the route turns east onto Front Street and continues between the river and the railroad tracks, turning north.\n\n\n=== Indiana County ===\nPA 259 crosses the Conemaugh River into West Wheatfield Township in Indiana County and becomes High Street, passing through the residential community of Robinson. The road curves east and becomes Robinson Street, passing more homes before heading northeast into woodland with occasional residences. The route turns north and runs through more wooded areas with some fields and homes, becoming unnamed and curving northeast. PA 259 crosses US 22 and continues northeast through more rural areas. The road winds north and crosses the Blacklick Creek into Brush Valley Township, passing through Heshbon. The route runs north-northeast through farmland and woodland with some homes, turning to the north. PA 259 heads into open agricultural areas with some residences and turns east, entering the residential community of Brush Valley. Here, the route turns north to form a concurrency with PA 56 before turning to the east. The road heads east-northeast through more farmland with some woods and homes, passing through Rico. PA 259 enters dense forests and turns north at Suncliff. The road continues through more wooded areas and becomes the eastern border of Yellow Creek State Park, fully entering the park as it turns east and runs to the south of Yellow Creek Lake. PA 259 heads northeast into Cherryhill Township and ends at an intersection with US 422.\n\n\n== Major intersections ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n U.S. Roads portal\n Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n== References ==",

Their first two (or possibly three) pairs of walking legs had spines; the last two pairs were long and powerful, without spines. The prosoma (head) was subtrapezoidal, with arcuate compound eyes on parallel axes. The male genital appendages were short with two distal spines.\n\n\n== Species ==\nRhenopterus contains three valid species, with other named species now seen as invalid or part of other genera.\nRhenopterus diensti St\u00f8rmer, 1936 - Germany (Lower Devonian)\nRhenopterus macrotuberculatus St\u00f8rmer, 1974 - Alken an der Mosel, Germany (Devonian)\nRhenopterus tuberculatus St\u00f8rmer, 1936 - Germany (Devonian)\nInvalid or reassigned species are listed below:\n\"Rhenopterus\" latus St\u00f8rmer, 1936 - Germany (Devonian), synonym of R. diensti.\n\"Rhenopterus\" sievertsi St\u00f8rmer, 1969 - Germany (Devonian), reclassified as a species of Adelophthalmus.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of eurypterids",

Specifically, EoPDH is a standardized methodology for transporting native Ethernet frames over the existing telecommunications copper infrastructure by leveraging the established PDH transport technology. EoPDH is one of several Ethernet transport technologies that enables Telecommunication Service Providers to offer \"Carrier Ethernet\" services. Also commonly used as a means of connecting businesses to a Metro Ethernet network.\nEoPDH is based on a collection of technologies and standards that allow telecommunications Carriers to make use of their extensive networks of legacy PDH and SONET/SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) equipment to provide new Ethernet services. In addition, the collection of EoPDH standards provide for interoperability and the gradual migration of Carriers to Ethernet network.\n\n\n== General Description ==\nEoPDH is a standardized methodology for transporting native Ethernet frames over PDH links such as T1, E1, or DS3. The technologies used in EoPDH include GFP frame encapsulation, Ethernet Mapping, Virtual Concatenation, Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme, and Management Messaging (OAM). Common practices in EoPDH equipment also include the tagging of traffic for separation into virtual networks, prioritization of user traffic, and a broad range of higher-layer applications such as DHCP servers and HTML user interfaces.\n\n\n== Related Standards ==\nStandards from the ITU-T:\nITU-T G.7041 Generic Framing Procedure\nITU-T G.7042 Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme\nITU-T G.7043 Virtual concatenation of plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) signals\nITU-T G.8040 GFP frame mapping into Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH)\nITU-T Y.1730 Requirements for OAM functions\nITU-T Y.1731 OAM functions and mechanisms\n\n\n== See also ==\nEthernet over SONET and Ethernet over SDH\nEthernet over PDH over SONET/SDH\nPacket over SONET/SDH\nMetro Ethernet\n\n\n== External links ==\nEthernet-over-PDH Technology Overview\nEoPDH Equipment\nFlash clip explaining EoPDH and EoPDH Equipment",

It rises at an altitude of 90 metres (300 ft) beneath an artificial lake at Bridehead House, Littlebredy, then flows west to its mouth on the English Channel near Burton Bradstock. Its name derives from the Celtic for boiling or gushing. It has nine tributaries and descends more than 60 metres (200 ft) in its first three miles. It reaches the coast just west of Burton Bradstock through a break in coastal cliffs at Burton Freshwater; here it meets the western end of Chesil Beach where it \"forms itself into a pool and fights to get to the sea intact before sinking into the shingle.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==",

He stood 224 cm (7 ft 4 in) and weighed 141 kg (22 stone; 311 pounds) at the age of 21, but experienced a second phase of growth in his late thirties, attaining a height of 251 cm (8 ft 3 in) and weighing 376 pounds.\nMyllyrinne is considered the tallest soldier ever, having served in the Finnish Defence Forces. He underwent his conscript training in 1929 in the Viipuri Heavy Artillery Regiment, and was 220 cm (7 ft 3 in) tall and really strong. In the 1930s he travelled around Europe as a professional wrestler and circus performer. He returned to Finland in 1939 to serve in the Finnish Army during the Winter War. In 1946, he moved to J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 and ran a chicken farm. He died in 1963 and is buried in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4.\nIn 1962, just a year before his death, he was measured by doctors at 2.47 m (8 ft 1.2 in). He had a 340 mm (13.4 in) size hand, the greatest known.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Tallest Man: V\u00e4in\u00f6 Myllyrinne\nV\u00e4in\u00f6's homepage",

            "content": "Sexplosion! is the third studio album by industrial disco band My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult. It was originally released in 1991 on Wax Trax! Records. Described by lead vocalist Groovie Mann as their \"sexy\" album, Sexplosion! is one of the band's biggest commercial and critical successes.\n\n\n== Background ==\nVocalist Groovie Mann called Sexplosion! the group's \"sexy\" album in 1995, adding that it was \"total disco\". He said it was intended as an open-ended fantasy for listeners and that it was genderless in its suggestions.\n\n\n== Release ==\nSexplosion! was released in 1991 on Wax Trax! Records. The title track peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs on October 26, 1991. The song \"Sex on Wheelz\" peaked at No. 15 on the same chart on July 27, 1991. After appearing on the Cool World soundtrack in 1992, \"Sex on Wheelz\" charted again, this time on the Alternative Songs Chart, where it peaked on No. 17 on August 15, 1992.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSexplosion! was well received by critics. Ned Raggett of Allmusic said it was the band's best album, calling it a clever blend of pop music sensibilities and trashiness. He went on to say the album mostly concerned itself with \"who is doing whom and whether or not there will be enough spangles, muscle boys, and cocktails available.\" He noted with approval its lounge music vibe in places, as well as its sampling of theme songs from James Bond movies including Thunderball. He particularly praised the album's hit single \"Sex on Wheelz\" for its \"nutty stomp and leer\" and called it \"as compressed and propulsive a celebration of fornication and driving as anything else America has ever come up with.\" Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was similarly enthusiastic, and began his review by saying, \"This record has absolutely no redeeming social value whatsoever, and it's wonderful.\" He went on to call the album a blend of \"sleaze ... camp ... and neon stylishness\", and said it is all about having adult fun.\n\n\n== Touring ==\nThe band toured in support of the album in July 1991. Eric Brace of The Washington Post said the live show was quite strong considering how devoted to camp the band is. He noted Groovie Mann's vocals and the excessive use of smoke machines as the show's primary weak points, while praising the performances of the instrumentalists in the group.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks written by Buzz McCoy and Groovie Mann.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nGroovie Mann \u2013 vocals\nBuzz McCoy \u2013 programming, guitar\nSekret Dezyre (Laura Dame) - vocals\nShawn Christopher \u2013 vocals (7)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSexplosion! at Discogs (list of releases)",

The Beaufort recruit kicked a career best six goals in a game against Sydney at Moorabbin Oval the following year. He then crossed to Footscray but could only manage one appearance in the seniors, against his next club Melbourne.\nTransformed during his time at Melbourne to a tagger, Chiron took part in their 1987 finals campaign but was suspended from the Semi Final. He had been found guilty of striking Shaun Smith with his right elbow in the Elimination Final, where he had been given the role of tagging Phil Krakouer. He participated in the famous 1987 Preliminary Final where Gary Buckenara kicked a goal after the siren to eliminate Melbourne. They went one better the following season and made the Grand Final but Chiron didn't play past round 17.\nChiron, who competes in Ironman Triathlon events, coached Clarence in the 1999 TSFL season.\n\n\n== References ==",

It is part of the Region of East Macedonia and Thrace. The capital is Xanthi. Together with the regional units Rhodope and Evros, it forms the geographical region of Western Thrace.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nXanthi borders the Bulgarian provinces of Smolyan and Kardzhali to the north, and the Aegean Sea to the south. The regional unit of Kavala lies to the west, Drama to the northwest and Rhodope to the east. The Rhodope Mountains cover the northern part of the regional unit. The highest point is Koula, at 1,827m.\nThe coastal area has a predominantly Mediterranean climate, whereas the northern mountainous part has a colder continental climate.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe regional unit Xanthi is subdivided into 4 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\nAbdera (Avdira, 2)\nMyki (3)\nTopeiros (4)\nXanthi (1)\n\n\n=== Prefecture ===\nXanthi was established as a prefecture in 1944 (Greek: \u039d\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u039e\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c2), when it was split off from the Rhodope Prefecture. As a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the prefecture was transformed into a regional unit within the East Macedonia and Thrace region, with no change in its boundaries. At the same time, the municipalities were reorganised, according to the table below.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nGR-2/E90, Via Egnatia, old and new, SW, Cen., S, SE\nGR-12/E90, W, Cen.\nGR-55\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe remains of the ancient city of Abdera have been excavated. Subterranean Macedonian tombs from the 2nd century BC have been discovered in Komnina. There is a Byzantine castle near the old town of Xanthi. During the 19th century, local tobacco production and commerce developed rapidly. The manors of the old city Xanthi, many of which are still intact, testify to the prosperity of the tobacco merchants during this period.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of settlements in the Xanthi regional unit\nSlavic toponyms of places in Xanthi Prefecture\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Hans Michael Frank (23 May 1900 \u2013 16 October 1946) was a German war criminal and lawyer who worked for the Nazi Party during the 1920s and 1930s, and later became Adolf Hitler's personal lawyer. After the invasion of Poland, Frank became Nazi Germany's chief jurist in the occupied Poland \"General Government\" territory. During his tenure throughout World War II (1939\u201345), he instituted a reign of terror against the civilian population and became directly involved in the mass murder of Jews. At the Nuremberg trials, he was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity and was executed.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nFrank, the middle child of three, was born in Karlsruhe to Karl Frank, a lawyer, and his wife, Magdalena (n\u00e9e Buchmaier), a daughter of a prosperous baker. He graduated from high school at the renowned Maximilians gymnasium in Munich, and right after, at seventeen, joined the German army fighting in World War I, barely reaching front-line combat.\nAfter the war, in 1919 and 1920, he was a member of the Thule v\u00f6lkisch society. He served also in the Freikorps under Franz Ritter von Epp's command, taking part in the crackdown of the M\u00fcnchner R\u00e4terepublik. In 1919, as did other members of the Thule society, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP) at its beginning.\nAlthough the DAP evolved quite soon into NSDAP (Nazi Party), Frank waited until September 1923 to become a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA), and in October he officially joined the NSDAP. In November of the same year, Frank took part in the Beer Hall Putsch, the failed coup attempt intended to parallel Mussolini's March on Rome. In the aftermath of the attempted putsch, Frank fled to Austria returning in Munich only in 1924, after the pending legal proceedings were stayed.\nFrank studied law (he passed the final state examination in 1926) and rose to become Adolf Hitler's personal legal adviser. As the Nazis rose to power, Frank also served as the party's lawyer. He represented it in over 2,400 cases and spent over $10,000. This sometimes brought him into conflict with other lawyers. Once, a former teacher appealed to him: \"I beg you to leave these people alone! No good will come of it! Political movements that begin in the criminal courts will end in the criminal courts!\" In September\u2013October 1930, Frank served as the defence lawyer at the court-martial in Leipzig of Lieutenants Richard Scheringer, Hans Friedrich Wendt and Hanns Ludin, three Reichswehr officers charged with membership in the NSDAP. The trial was a media sensation. Hitler himself testified and the defence successfully put the Weimar Republic itself on trial. Many Army officers developed a sympathetic view of the National Socialist movement as a consequence.\nFrank was elected to the Reichstag in 1930, and in 1933 he was made Minister of Justice for Bavaria. From 1933, he was also the head of the National Socialist Jurists Association and President of the Academy of German Law. Frank objected to extrajudicial killings as it weakened the power of the legal system (of which he himself was a prominent member), both at the Dachau concentration camp and during the Night of the Long Knives.\nFrank's view of what the judicial process required was that:\n\n[The judge's] role is to safeguard the concrete order of the racial community, to eliminate dangerous elements, to prosecute all acts harmful to the community, and to arbitrate in disagreements between members of the community. The National Socialist ideology, especially as expressed in the Party programme and in the speeches of our Leader, is the basis for interpreting legal sources.\n\nFrom 1934, Frank was Reich Minister Without Portfolio. On 7 April 1938, Frank addressed some 10,000 National Socialists at the Passau Nibelungenhalle.\n\n\n== Wartime career ==\n\nIn September 1939 Frank was assigned as Chief of Administration to Gerd von Rundstedt in the German military administration in occupied Poland. Beginning 26 October 1939, following the end of the invasion of Poland, Frank was assigned Governor-General of the occupied Polish territories (Generalgouverneur f\u00fcr die besetzten polnischen Gebiete), controlling the General Government, the area of Poland not directly incorporated into Germany (roughly 90,000 km2 out of the 187,000 km2 Germany had gained).\nFrank oversaw the segregation of the Jews into ghettos, especially the enormous Warsaw ghetto, and the use of Polish civilians as forced labour. In 1942 he lost his positions of authority outside the General Government after annoying Hitler with a series of speeches in Berlin, Vienna, Heidelberg, and Munich and also as part of a power struggle with Friedrich Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger, the State Secretary for Security \u2013 head of the SS and the police in the General Government. Kr\u00fcger himself was ultimately replaced by Wilhelm Koppe.\nOn 16 December 1941, Frank spelled out to his senior officials the approaching annihilation of the Jews:\n\nA great Jewish migration will begin in any case. But what should we do with the Jews? Do you think they will be settled in Ostland, in villages? We were told in Berlin, 'Why all this bother? We can do nothing with them either in Ostland or in the Reichskommissariat. So liquidate them yourselves.' Gentlemen, I must ask you to rid yourself of all feelings of pity. We must annihilate the Jews wherever we find them and whenever it is possible.\n\nWhen this was read to him at the Nuremberg trials he said:\n\nOne has to take the diary as a whole. You can not go through 43 volumes and pick out single sentences and separate them from their context. I would like to say here that I do not want to argue or quibble about individual phrases. It was a wild and stormy period filled with terrible passions, and when a whole country is on fire and a life and death struggle is going on, such words may easily be used... Some of the words are terrible. I myself must admit that I was shocked at many of the words which I had used.\n\nAn assassination attempt by Polish Secret State on 29/30 January 1944 (the night preceding the 11th anniversary of Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany) in Szar\u00f3w near Krak\u00f3w failed. A special train with Frank travelling to Lviv was derailed after an explosive device discharged but no one was killed.\nHans Frank patronized the General Government chess tournaments (1940\u20131944) which started in the context of a chess congress held in Krak\u00f3w in 1940.\n\n\n== Death camps ==\nThe General Government was the location of four of the six extermination camps, namely, Be\u0142\u017cec, Treblinka, Majdanek and Sobib\u00f3r. Che\u0142mno and Birkenau fell just outside the borders of the General Government.\nFrank later claimed that the extermination of Jews was entirely controlled by Heinrich Himmler and the SS and that he, Frank, was unaware of the extermination camps in the General Government until early in 1944, a surprising claim and one found to be untrue by the Nuremberg tribunal.\nDuring his testimony at Nuremberg, Frank claimed he submitted resignation requests to Hitler on 14 occasions, but Hitler would not allow him to resign. Frank fled the General Government in January 1945 as the Soviet Army advanced.\n\n\n== Capture and trial ==\nFrank was captured by American troops on 3 May 1945, at Tegernsee in southern Bavaria. He attempted suicide twice but failed both times. He was indicted for war crimes and tried before the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg from 20 November 1945 to 1 October 1946. During the trial he converted, guided by Fr Sixtus O'Connor OFM, to Roman Catholicism, and claimed to have had a series of religious experiences.\n\nFrank voluntarily surrendered 43 volumes of his personal diaries to the Allies, which were then used against him as evidence of his guilt. Frank confessed to some of the charges and expressed remorse on the witness stand, showing penitence for his crimes. On the witness stand, he said,\n\nafter having heard the testimony of the witness Rudolf H\u00f6ss, my conscience does not allow me to throw the responsibility solely on these minor people. I myself have never installed an extermination camp for Jews, or promoted the existence of such camps; but if Adolf Hitler personally has laid that dreadful responsibility on his people, then it is mine too, for we have fought against Jewry for years; and we have indulged in the most horrible utterances.\n\nHe and Albert Speer were allegedly the only defendants to show remorse for their war crimes. At the same time he accused the Allies, especially the Soviets, of their own wartime atrocities. The former German Governor-General of Poland was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity on 1 October 1946, and was sentenced to death by hanging. The death sentence was carried out at Nuremberg Prison on 16 October by US Army Master Sergeant John C. Woods. Journalist Joseph Kingsbury-Smith wrote of the execution:\n\nHans Frank was next in the parade of death. He was the only one of the condemned to enter the chamber with a smile on his countenance. And, although nervous and swallowing frequently, this man, who was converted to Roman Catholicism after his arrest, gave the appearance of being relieved at the prospect of atoning for his evil deeds.\n\nHe answered to his name quietly and when asked for any last statement, he replied \"I am thankful for the kind treatment during my captivity and I ask God to accept me with mercy.\"\nHis body and those of the other nine executed prisoners and the corpse of Hermann G\u00f6ring were cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.\n\n\n== Memoirs ==\nWhile awaiting execution, he wrote his memoirs, Im Angesicht des Galgens (In the face of the gallows). In the capacity as his attorney, Frank was privy to personal details of Hitler's life. In his memoirs, written shortly before his execution, Frank made the sensational claim that Hitler had commissioned him to investigate Hitler's family in 1930 after a \"blackmail letter\" had been received from Hitler's nephew, William Patrick Hitler, who allegedly threatened to reveal embarrassing facts about his uncle's ancestry. Frank said that the investigation uncovered evidence that Maria Schicklgruber, Hitler's paternal grandmother, had been working as a cook in the household of a Jewish man named Leopold Frankenberger before she gave birth to Hitler's father, Alois, out of wedlock. Frank claimed that he had obtained from a relative of Hitler's by marriage a collection of letters between Maria Schicklgruber and a member of the Frankenberger family that discussed a stipend for her after she left the family's employ. According to Frank, Hitler told him that the letters did not prove that the Frankenberger son was his grandfather but rather his grandmother had merely extorted money from Frankenberger by threatening to claim his paternity of her illegitimate child.\nFrank accepted this explanation, but added that it was still just possible that Hitler had some Jewish ancestry. But he thought it unlikely because, \"... from his entire demeanor, the fact that Adolf Hitler had no Jewish blood coursing through his veins seems so clearly evident that nothing more need be said on this.\"\nGiven that all Jews had been expelled from the province of Styria (which includes Graz) in the 15th century and were not allowed to return until the 1860s, scholars such as Sir Ian Kershaw and Brigitte Hamann dismiss as baseless the Frankenberger hypothesis, which before had only Frank's speculation to support it. There is no evidence outside of Frank's statements for the existence of a \"Leopold Frankenberger\" living in Graz in the 1830s, and Frank's story is notably inaccurate on several points such as the claim that Maria Schicklgruber came from \"Leonding near Linz\", when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones near the village of D\u00f6llersheim. Some suggest that Frank (who turned against National Socialism after 1945 but remained an anti-Semitic fanatic) made the claim that Hitler had Jewish ancestry as way of proving that Hitler was really a \"Jew\" and not an \"Aryan\"; and in this way, \"proved\" that the Third Reich's crimes were the work of the \"Jewish\" Hitler. The full anti-Semitic implications of Frank's story were borne out in a letter entitled \"Was Hitler a Jew?\", written to the editor of a Saudi newspaper in 1982 by a German man living in Saudi Arabia. The writer accepted Frank's story as the truth, and added since Hitler was a Jew, \"the Jews should pay Germans reparations for the War, because one of theirs caused the destruction of Germany\".\nBut Jewish-American author Ron Rosenbaum suggested another reason for Frank's story:\n\nOn the other hand, a different version of Frank emerges in the brilliantly vicious, utterly unforgiving portrait of him by his son, Niklas Frank, who (in a memoir called In the Shadow of the Reich) depicts his father as a craven coward and weakling, but one not without a kind of animal cunning, an instinct for lying, insinuation, self-aggrandizement. For this Hans Frank, disgraced and facing death on the gallows for following Hitler, fabricating such a story might be a cunning way of ensuring his place in history as the one man who gave the world the hidden key to the mystery of Hitler's psyche. While at the same time, revenging himself on his former master for having led him to this end by foisting a sordid and humiliating explanation of Hitler on him for all posterity. In any case, it was one Frank knew the victors would find seductive.\n\n\n== Family ==\nOn 2 April 1925 Frank married 29-year-old secretary Brigitte Herbst (25 December 1895 \u2013 9 March 1959) from Forst (Lausitz). The wedding took place in Munich and the couple honeymooned in Venetia. Hans and Brigitte Frank had five children:\nSigrid Frank (born 13 March 1927, Munich \u2013 d. in South Africa)\nNorman Frank (born 3 June 1928, Munich \u2013 d. 2010)\nBrigitte Frank (born 13 January 1935, Munich \u2013 d. 1981)\nMichael Frank (born 15 February 1937, Munich \u2013 d. 1990)\nNiklas Frank (born 9 March 1939, Munich)\nBrigitte Frank had a reputation for having a more dominant personality than her husband: after 1939 she called herself \"a queen of Poland\" (\"K\u00f6nigin von Polen\"). The marriage was unhappy and became colder from year to year. When Frank sought a divorce in 1942, Brigitte gave everything to save their marriage in order to remain the \"First Lady in the General Government\". One of her most famous comments was \"I'd rather be widowed than divorced from a Reichsminister!\" Frank answered: \"So you are my deadly enemy!\"\nIn 1987, Niklas Frank wrote a book about his father, Der Vater: Eine Abrechnung (\"The Father: A Settling of Accounts\"), which was published in English in 1991 as In the Shadow of the Reich. The book, which was serialized in the magazine Stern, caused controversy in Germany because of the scathing way in which the younger Frank depicted his father: Niklas referred to him as \"a slime-hole of a Hitler fanatic\" and questioned his remorse before his execution.\nNiklas is the sole living child of Hans and Brigitte Frank. Sigrid remained a committed Nazi who emigrated to South Africa during the apartheid regime and died there. Brigitte committed suicide in 1981; Michael and Norman died in 1990 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\n== Quotations ==\nIn an interview published in the 6 June 1940 edition of the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter:\n\nIn Prague, big red posters were put up on which one could read that seven Czechs had been shot today. I said to myself, 'If I had to put up a poster for every seven Poles shot, the forests of Poland would not be sufficient to manufacture the paper.'\n\nA slightly different translation is given by another author. The occasion was a widely distributed proclamation in German\u2013occupied Czechoslovakia announcing the execution of seven Czech students:\n\nIf I had to order a distribution of posters announcing such an event every time I order a shooting of seven Poles, there would not be enough trees in the Polish forests to supply the necessary paper.\n\nIn the Nuremberg trials:\n\nA thousand years will pass and still Germany's guilt will not have been erased.\n\nThere is still one statement of mine which I must rectify. On the witness stand I said that a thousand years would not suffice to erase the guilt brought upon our people because of Hitler's conduct in this war. Every possible guilt incurred by our nation has already been completely wiped out today, not only by the conduct of our war-time enemies towards our nation and its soldiers, which has been carefully kept out of this Trial, but also by the tremendous mass crimes of the most frightful sort which\u2014as I have now learned\u2014have been and still are being committed against Germans by Russians, Poles, and Czechs, especially in East Prussia, Silesia, Pomerania, and Sudetenland. Who shall ever judge these crimes against the German people?\"\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHans Frank has been portrayed by the following actors in film, television and theater productions.\nLothar Bellag in the 1968 East German television miniseries Wege \u00fcbers Land.\nVoja Miri\u0107 in the 1971 Yugoslavian television production Nirnberski epilog\nJerzy Duszy\u0144ski in the 1976 Polish film Ocali\u0107 miasto\nJohn Bailey in the 1978 United States television production Holocaust\nRobert Austin in the 1984 United States television production Pope John Paul II\nFrank Moore in the 2000 Canadian/U.S. T.V. production Nuremberg\nMatt Craven in the 2005 Polish television production Karol, un uomo diventato Papa\nAndreas Conrad in the 2005 German T.V. miniseries Speer und Er.\nHarald Posch in the 2005 Italian/U.S./Polish television production Pope John Paul II\nWill Keen in the 2011 BBC production The Man Who Crossed Hitler\nLiterature\nCurzio Malaparte, an Italian writer who during the war also served as a reservist Italian army officer, and unofficial diplomat because of his ties with Germany, wrote extensively in his 1944 book Kaputt! about Frank and the convivial dinners that he held in his mansions outside Warsaw and Cracow for Malaparte and other guests.

            "content": "The String Quartet No. 14 in D minor, known as Death and the Maiden, is a piece by Franz Schubert that has been called \"one of the pillars of the chamber music repertoire.\" Composed in 1824, after the composer suffered through a serious illness and realized that he was dying, it is Schubert's testament to death. The quartet is named for the theme of the second movement, which Schubert took from a song he wrote in 1817 of the same title. The theme of death is palpable in all four movements of the quartet.\nThe quartet was first played in 1826 in a private home, and was not published until 1831, three years after Schubert's death. Yet, passed over in his lifetime, the quartet has become a staple of the quartet repertoire. It is D 810 in Otto Erich Deutsch's thematic catalog of Schubert's works.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n1823 and 1824 were hard years for Schubert. For much of 1823 he was sick, some scholars believe with an outburst of tertiary stage syphilis, and in May had to be hospitalized. He was also without money: he had entered into a disastrous deal with Diabelli to publish a batch of works, and received almost no payment; and his latest attempt at opera, Fierabras, was a flop. In a letter to a friend, he wrote,\n\nThink of a man whose health can never be restored, and who from sheer despair makes matters worse instead of better. Think, I say, of a man whose brightest hopes have come to nothing, to whom love and friendship are but torture, and whose enthusiasm for the beautiful is fast vanishing; and ask yourself if such a man is not truly unhappy.\n\nYet, despite his bad health, poverty and depression, Schubert continued to turn out the tuneful, light and gem\u00fctlich music that made him the toast of Viennese society: the song cycle Die sch\u00f6ne M\u00fcllerin, the octet for string quartet, contrabass, clarinet, horn and bassoon, more than 20 songs, and numerous light pieces for piano.\nAfter 1820, Schubert returned to the string quartet form, which he had last visited as a teenager. He wrote the one-movement Quartettsatz in 1820, and the Rosamunde quartet in 1824 using a theme from the incidental music that he wrote for a play that failed. These quartets are a huge step forward from his initial attempts. Even Schubert recognized this fact; in July 1824, he wrote his brother Ferdinand of his earlier quartets, \"it would be better if you stuck to other quartets than mine, for there is nothing in them...\" There are several qualities that set these mature quartets apart from Schubert's earlier attempts. In the early quartets, it is primarily the first violin that carries the melody, with the other instruments playing supporting roles; in the later quartets, the part writing is much more advanced, and each instrument brings its own character and presence, for a more complex and integrated texture. Also, the later quartets are structurally much more integrated, with motifs, harmonies, and textures recurring in a way that ties the entire work together.\n\nBut beyond these technical improvements, Schubert in these later works made the quartet medium his own. \"He had now ceased to write quartets to order, for experimental study, or for the home circle,\" writes Walter Willson Cobbett. \"To the independent artist... the string quartet had now also become a vehicle for conveying to the world his inner struggles.\" For Schubert, who lived a life suspended between the lyrical, romantic, charming and the dramatic, chaotic, and depressive, the string quartet offered a medium \"to reconcile his essentially lyric themes with his feeling for dramatic utterance within a form that provided the possibility of extreme color contrasts,\" writes music historian Homer Ulrich.\nSchubert wrote the D minor quartet in March 1824, within weeks of completing the A minor Rosamunde quartet. He apparently planned to publish a three-set volume of quartets; but the Rosamunde was published within a year, while the D minor quartet was only published in 1831, three years after Schubert's death, by Diabelli. It was first played in January, 1826, at the Vienna home of Karl and Franz Hacker, amateur violinists, apparently with Schubert on the viola.\n\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe quartet takes its name from the lied \"Der Tod und das M\u00e4dchen\", D 531, a setting of the poem of the same name by Matthias Claudius that Schubert wrote in 1817. The theme of the song forms the basis of the second movement of the quartet. The theme is a death knell that accompanies the song about the terror and comfort of death.\n\nBut it is not only this theme of the quartet that recalls death. The quote from the song \"makes explicit the overriding theme of the work, its bleak vision and almost unremitting foreboding,\" writes Andrew Clements. From the violent opening unison. the first movement runs a relentless race through terror, pain and resignation, ending with a dying D minor chord. \"The struggle with Death is the subject of the first movement, and the andante accordingly dwells on Death's words,\" writes Cobbett. After a scherzo movement, with a trio that provides the only lyrical respite from the depressing mood of the piece, the quartet ends with a tarantella \u2013 the traditional dance to ward off madness and death. \"The finale is most definitely in the character of a dance of death; ghastly visions whirl past in the inexorable uniform rhythm of the tarantella,\" writes Cobbett.\nSo strong is the association of death with the quartet that some analysts consider it to be programmatic, rather than absolute music. \"The first movement of Schubert's Death and the Maiden string quartet can be interpreted in a quasi-programmatic fashion, even though it is usually viewed as an abstract work,\" writes Deborah Kessler. Theologian Frank Ruppert sees the quartet as a musical expression of Judaeo-Christian religious myths. \"This quartet, like so many of Schubert's works, is a kind of para-liturgy,\" he writes. Each movement is about a different episode in the mythic process of death and resurrection.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe quartet throughout is characterized by sudden dramatic shifts from fortissimo to pianissimo, from the lyrical to the compelling and dramatic. A driving undercurrent of triplets is a recurring motif in all four movements.\nThere are four movements:\nAllegro, in D minor and common time (4/4)\nAndante con moto, in G minor and cut time (2/2)\nScherzo: Allegro molto, in D minor and 3/4 time\nPresto, in D minor and 6/8 time\n\n\n=== First movement: Allegro ===\n\n\n=== Second movement: Andante con moto ===\n\n\n=== Third movement: Scherzo Allegro molto ===\n\nCobbett describes the third movement as the \"dance of the demon fiddler\". There is indeed something demonic in this fast-paced scherzo, full of syncopations and, like the other movements, dramatic leaps from fortissimo to pianissimo.\nThe scherzo is designed as a classical minuet: two strains in 3/4 time, repeated, in D minor, followed by a contrasting trio section in D major, at a slower tempo, and ending with a recapitulation of the opening strains. The trio section is the only real respite from the compelling pace of the whole quartet: a typically Schubertesque melody, with the first violin playing a dancing descant above the melody line in the lower voices, then the viola takes the melody as the first violin plays high eighth notes.\nThe scherzo is a short movement, serving as an interlude leading to the frenetic last movement.\n\n\n=== Fourth movement: Presto ===\nThe finale of the quartet is a tarantella in rondo-sonata form, in D minor. The tarantella is a breakneck Italian dance in 6/8 time, that, according to tradition, was a treatment for madness and convulsions brought on by the bite of a tarantula spider. Appropriately, Cobbett calls this movement \"a dance of death.\"\nThe movement is built of sections. The first, main section recurs between each of the subsequent sections.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nAfter the initial reading of the quartet in 1826, the quartet was played again at a house concert in the home of composer Franz Lachner, with violinist Ignaz Schuppanzigh leading. Schuppanzigh, one of the leading violinists of the time, who debuted many of Beethoven's and Schubert's quartets, was reportedly unimpressed. \"Brother, this is nothing at all, let well alone: stick to your Lieder,\" the aging Schuppanzigh is reported to have said to Schubert.\nSchuppanzigh's impressions notwithstanding, Schubert's quartet soon won a leading place on the concert stage and in the hearts of musicians. \"Only the excellence of such a work as Schubert's D minor Quartet... can in any way console us for the early and grievous death of this first-born of Beethoven; in a few years he achieved and perfected things as no one before him,\" wrote Robert Schumann of the quartet.\nThe quartet has been honored by several transcriptions. In 1878, Robert Franz transcribed it for piano duet, and in 1896 Mahler planned an arrangement for string orchestra and notated the details in a score of the quartet (the work was never completed, however, and only the second movement was written out and played; the modern revival of the arrangement is in a version edited by David Matthews).\nIn the 20th century, British composer John Foulds and American composer Andy Stein made versions for full symphony orchestra.\nAt Fridtjof Nansen's state funeral in 1930, Death and the Maiden was performed instead of speeches.\nThe quartet has also inspired other works. Ariel Dorfman's 1991 play Death and the Maiden, adapted for film in 1994 by Roman Polanski, is about a woman tortured and raped in a South American dictatorship, to the strains of the quartet. It has also appeared as incidental music in numerous films: The Portrait of a Lady (Jane Campion, 1996), What? (Roman Polanski, 1972), Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking (BBC production, 2004), and in Samuel Beckett's radio play All That Fall (1962).\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\nBerger, Melvin (2001).

            "content": "The railway network of Thailand is managed and operated by the State Railway of Thailand (SRT).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nInterest in rail transport in Siam can be traced to when King Rama IV was given a gift of a model railway from Queen Victoria in 1855. The first railway line, 20 km in length, named the Paknam Railway between Bangkok\u2013Samut Prakan began construction in July 1891 under a 50-year concession with a Danish company. Paknam Railway opened in 1894. This railway line was electrified in 1925, made it into the first electric railway service of Southeast Asia. This railway line was decommissioned on 1 January 1957.\nRoyal State Railways of Siam (RSR) was found in 1890 at the same time with a construction of the Bangkok-Ayutthaya railway (71 km or 44 mi), the first part of the Northern Line, was started in 1891 and opened on 26 March 1895. The Thonburi-Phetchaburi line (150 km or 93 mi), later the Southern Line, opened on 19 June 1903.\nThe Northern Line was originally built as 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) standard gauge, but in September 1919 it was decided to standardize on 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) metre gauge and the Northern Line was regauged during the next ten years. On 1 July 1951, RSR changed its name to the present State Railway of Thailand (SRT).\nIn 2005 SRT had 4,070 km (2,530 mi) of track, all of it metre gauge. Nearly all is single-track, although some important sections around Bangkok are double or triple-tracked and there are plans to extend this.\nOn 21 March 2015 Prime Minister Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha said that Thailand and China had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in late-2014 on joint railway construction furthering Thailand's seven-year strategy on the development of transportation from 2015-2022. The MoU stipulates that a joint Thai-Chinese 1.435 metre standard-gauge rail network project bear fruit in 2018. Thailand is to be responsible for conducting environmental impact assessments and land expropriations. China is responsible for project design and construction. The project includes four routes: 133 km between Bangkok and Kaeng Khoi; 246.5 km between Kaeng Khoi and Map Ta Phut; 138.5 km between Kaeng Khoi and Nakhon Ratchasima; and 355 km from Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai.\n\n\n=== Issues ===\nThe SRT has long been popularly perceived by the public as inefficient and resistant to change. Trains are usually late, and most of its equipment is old and poorly maintained. The worst financially performing state enterprise, the SRT consistently operates at a loss despite being endowed with large amounts of property and receiving large government budgets; it reported a preliminary loss of 7.58 billion baht in 2010. Recurring government attempts at restructuring and/or privatization throughout the 2000s have always been strongly opposed by the union and have not made any progress.\nOnly two percent or less of Thailand's freight is transported by rail, despite rail being roughly half the cost of road transport and cleaner environmentally.\n\n\n== Operators ==\nAll intercity rail transportation is managed by the State Railway of Thailand, a government agency responsible for rail infrastructure investment as well as freight and passenger services.\nIn Bangkok, the Skytrain is operated by Bangkok Mass Transit System Public Company Limited (BTSC) under a concession granted by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) but the investment for the structure and system were fully supported by BTSC.\nThe underground system is operated by Bangkok Metro Company Limited (BMCL), while whole project investments were shared by Mass Rapid Transit Authorities (MRTA) and BMCL, which all civil structures was provided by government sector and the system was provided by private sector (BMCL). The deal of contract between BMCL and MRTA are under the concession agreement for 25 years operation.\n\n\n== Network ==\n\nThailand has 4,431 kilometres of metre gauge railway tracks not including mass transit lines in Bangkok. All national rail services are managed by the State Railway of Thailand. The four main lines are the Northern Line, which terminates in Chiang Mai, the Northeastern Line, which terminates at Ubon Ratchathani and the Lao border in Nong Khai Province, the Eastern Line, which terminates at the Cambodian border in Sa Kaeo Province, and the Southern Line, which terminates at the Malaysian border in Songkhla and Narathiwat Provinces.\n\n\n=== Current lines ===\n\n\n=== Future lines ===\n\n\n=== Defunct lines ===\n\n\n=== Rail links to adjacent countries ===\n Malaysia - yes - same 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) gauge\n Laos - yes - 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in) gauge across Mekong River on Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge\n Cambodia - yes - disused (being rebuilt)\n Myanmar - no - defunct - (see Death Railway). But projected extension will rebuild the route.\n\n\n== Rail transport in Bangkok ==\n\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, King Rama V eagerly built a tram network for Bangkok by employing foreign engineers and technicians, especially Danish engineers. In fact, Bangkok had electric trams before Copenhagen. However, due to a lack of interest and maintenance the tram network was completely scrapped in 1968.\n\n\n=== Greater Bangkok commuter rail ===\n\n\n=== Rapid transit systems ===\n\nBangkok is currently served by three rapid transit systems: the BTS Skytrain, the MRT and the Airport Rail Link. Although proposals for the development of rapid transit in Bangkok had been made since 1975, leading to plans for the failed Lavalin Skytrain, it was only in 1999 that the BTS finally began operation.\n\nIn addition to rapid transit and heavy rail lines, there have been proposals for several monorail systems, the most notable being a line linking Chulalongkorn University with Siam Square, to be funded by the BMA. In 2010 Grand Canal Land Company proposed a 600\u2013800 metre line linking its properties on Rama IX Road with the Phra Ram 9 MRT Station, but failed to secure approval.\nThe Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region has plans for the following rapid transit lines:\nDevelopment is divided into three stages, in addition to those lines already open or under construction:\nNote: * Exclude BMA Monorail\n\n\n== Rolling stock ==\n\n\n=== State Railway of Thailand ===\n\n\n=== BTS Skytrain ===\n\nThe BTS Skytrain uses two variations of Electric Multiple Unit rolling stock. All operate on 1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in) track gauge (standard gauge). All trains have 4 doors on each side per car, an air-conditioning unit, and LCD monitors for public announcement and advertising. The power supply for all trains is at 750 V DC from the third rail.\n\n\n=== Bangkok MRT ===\n\nThe Bangkok MRT consists of two lines: the Blue Line and Purple Line: each train consists of two motor cars and a centre trailer car.\n\n\n=== Airport Rail Link ===\n\nSiemens supplied nine Desiro Class 360/2 trainsets. The only significant difference from the UK units is a much larger air-conditioning pod on the roof, providing extra power to cope with the Thai climate. City services is operated by five three-car trains, and the Express services by four trainsets with a fourth car for check-in baggage. The first trains left Germany in September 2007, and testing in Bangkok began in March 2008. On 15 May 2012 the Thai Cabinet approved a budget of 5.2 billion baht for the SRT to order 7 new, 4 car sets of Siemens Desiro rolling stock to be delivered by 2014. However, as of June 2013 no order for new rolling stock had yet been placed. The Ministry of Transport was considering purchasing cheaper Chinese (CNR) or Spanish (CAF) rolling stock which would require changing the Siemens closed signalling system to an open system.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Tracks ===\n\nMost existing SRT lines use metre gauge, although standard gauge is used on rapid transit lines. As of 2013, approximately 4,346 km (2,700 mi) of track was in use throughout Thailand:\n4,346 km (2,700 mi) metre gauge (1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3\u20448 in))\n80.55 km (50.05 mi) standard gauge (1,435 mm (4 ft 8 1\u20442 in))\n\n\n=== Railway stations ===\n\nAbout 450 stations.\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\nAbout 1,000 bridges.\n\n\n=== Tunnels ===\n\nThere are seven railway tunnels in Thailand, amounting to a total length of 3.63 km (2.26 mi).\n\n\n=== Level crossings ===\nThe Thai rail network has 2,624 level crossings nationwide (2016). Many have no crossing barriers, making them frequent sites of accidents.\n\n\n=== Signalling ===\nSRT uses colour light signals and semaphore signal\n\n\n== Planning ==\nMass transit routes in Bangkok are set to be expanded. Excluding the already under construction extensions to the Skytrain, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is planning a northern as well as western expansion of the Skytrain. The central government, through the State Railway of Thailand and Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) are planning to build several new rapid transit routes.\nThe government is considering a restructuring of the State Railway of Thailand and granting operating concessions to private freight operators. An international rail link has opened to Vientiane in Laos via Nong Khai and the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge. The 6 km \"missing link\" on the Eastern line between Aranyaphratet and Poipet (Cambodia) is also being rebuilt with construction starting in late 2013 for completion in 900 days.\n\n\n=== Double tracking ===\nMost of Thailand's roughly 4,000 km rail network is single track. A government initiative to move air and road transport to rail passed a major milestone on 28 December 2017 when the SRT signed nine contracts with private contractors to complete double tracking on 702 km of the SRT network. This phase one of the double-tracking project will cost 69.5 billion baht. The government's aim is to reduce the nation's logistical overhead, some 1.75 trillion baht, by moving air and road freight to rail. Moving a tonne of freight by rail costs 0.93 baht per kilometre compared with 1.72 baht by road. As of the contract signing date, 86 percent of Thailand's freight moves by road and only two percent by rail.\nPhase one of the project will see the following five sections of double track laid:\nMap Kabao in Saraburi Province to Thanon Chira Junction in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, 136 km.\nPrachuap Khiri Khan to Chumphon, 168 km.\nNakhon Pathom to Hua Hin, 169 km.\nLopburi to Pak Nam Pho in Nakhon Sawan, 145 km.\nHua Hin to Prachuap Khiri Khan, 84 km.\nCabinet approval is expected to allow the signing of contracts for phase two of the double tracking project by March 2018. The second phase will add a second track to 2,217 km of single track over nine rail links at a cost of 398 billion baht. Government plans call for an overall investment of 600 billion baht to create 2,588 km of double tracks.\n\n\n=== New SRT lines ===\nThere are also plans to construct new railway routes:\nChiang Rai in the north via Denchai Junction - 326 km, 77 billion baht. This route is currently under EIA evaluation\nBan Phai (on the Northeast line) - Roi Et - Mukdahan - Nakhon Phanom - 347 km, 42 billion baht. (Completing public consultations & final route evaluation by Oct 2014)\nKanchanaburi - Dewei (Burma): 190 km. Route to be finalised\nPhuket from Surat Thani\nConnect the Maeklong railway to main lines\n\n\n=== Thailand high-speed railways ===\n\nIn October 2010, the Thai parliament approved initial proposals for a high speed rail (HSR) network. Five lines capable of handling 250 km/h speeds would radiate from Bangkok.\nIn March 2013, the transport minister revealed that only one company would be selected to run all high-speed train routes, scheduled to be operational between 2018 and 2019. The first 86 km section from Bang Sue to Ayuthaya was planned to be tendered in late 2013. However, a seven-month-long political crisis involving the dissolution of parliament and an annulled February 2014 election culminated in a military coup in May 2014. Subsequently, in July 2014 the new military administration deferred all HSR plans until the next civilian government is installed.\nFollowing the military coup of May 2014 and his elevation to the office of prime minister, Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha proposed connecting Bangkok to two popular resort cities, Pattaya and Hua Hin, by high-speed rail. The Transport Ministry's Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning had earlier conducted studies on both routes. They assumed that, for the Bangkok-Pattaya line, trains would run through Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Pattaya, terminating in Rayong, a total distance of 193.5 km. Construction costs were estimated at 152 billion baht with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13 percent. Construction would take about 54 months. The route to Hua Hin would be 209 km in length with an investment cost of about 98 billion baht and EIRR of 8.1 percent. The office concluded that these routes would be of little interest to private investors due to the high investment required, coupled with a low rate of return.\n\n\n==== Bangkok\u2013Chiang Mai Shinkansen ====\nJapan has proposed Shinkansen technology for a high-speed rail link between Bangkok and the northern city of Chiang Mai.\nIn August 2016, according to the Transport Minister Arkom Termpittayapaisith, Thailand and Japan discussed a high-speed train to link Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Japan agreed to use the Shinkansen as its bullet train model.\nIn December 2017 Japan reported to Thailand that construction of a Shinkansen-style bullet train between the two cities would cost the Thai government 420 billion baht (US$12.9 billion). The line would consist of 300 kph trains traveling between the two cities in 3.5 hours, stopping at 12 stations en route. Fares would start at 80 baht, with a surcharge of 1.5 baht per kilometre. Full fares are expected to be just over 1,000 baht. Reacting to the high cost estimate, the Thai government instructed the Transport Ministry to study the possibility of reducing the train's maximum speed to 180\u2013200 kph in an effort to cut costs.\nThe first phase of the 670 km long Bangkok-Chiang Mai bullet train project is the 380 km Bangkok to Phitsanulok stretch. It is estimated to cost 280 billion baht. This portion of the route is scheduled to be submitted to the Thai cabinet for financial approval in April 2018. Completion of the entire Bangkok\u2013Chiang Mai line is projected to be 2025.\n\n\n==== Sino-Thai railways ====\nChina's dream is to construct a 3,000 km railway from Kunming to Singapore, traversing Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. That plan is in jeopardy in the near-term.\nIn November 2014, Thailand and China signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to construct the Thai portion of the transnational railway running from Kunming, China to the Gulf of Thailand. In November 2015, both parties agreed to a division of labour. Under the framework, a joint venture would be set up to run the project. China would conduct feasibility studies, design the system, construct tunnels and bridges, and lay track. Thailand would conduct social and environmental impact studies, expropriate land for construction, handle general civil engineering and power supply, and supply construction materials.\nOnce built, China would operate and maintain the system for the first three years of operation. Between the third and the seventh years, both countries would share responsibility. Later Thailand would take on responsibility with China as adviser. China would train Thai personnel to operate and maintain the system.\nDual standard-gauge tracks would be laid throughout the project. In Thailand, two routes would diverge at a junction in Kaeng Khoi District in Saraburi Province. One to connect Bangkok to Kaeng Khoi. The other route to connect Kaeng Khoi with Map Ta Phut of Rayong Province. From Kaeng Khoi tracks would lead north to Nakhon Ratchasima and on to Nong Khai Province. Construction would be divided into four sections: Bangkok-Kaeng Khoi, Map Ta Phut-Kaeng Khoi, Kaeng Khoi-Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Ratchasima-Nong Khai.\nConstruction of Thailand's 873-kilometre-long portion of the railway system started in December 2017. It will connect to a 417 km line from Vientiane to the northern Lao border and a 520 km line from the Lao border to Kunming. Both the Thai and Lao portions of the route are on hold due to conflicts with the Chinese over funding and land disbursements.\n\n\n==== High-speed routes ====\n\n\n== See also ==\nState Railway of Thailand\nHigh-speed rail in Thailand\nBangkok Skytrain\nBangkok Subway\nTransport in Thailand\nSiam Park City Railway\nBurma Railway also known as Death Railway, Thailand\u2013Burma Railway\nRapid transit in Thailand\nList of rail accidents in Thailand\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHigh speed rail system in Thailand\nState Railway of Thailand (SRT)",
