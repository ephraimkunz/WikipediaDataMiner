            "content": "Thomas Donald Bruce McArthur (born October 8, 1951) is an accused Canadian serial killer. McArthur, who was a self-employed landscaper, is charged with six counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of missing men from Church and Wellesley, Toronto's gay village. He pled guilty to felony assault against a gay man in another case in 2003.\nPolice have found human remains of several men in private gardens, where McArthur has worked as a landscape gardener. So far, the investigation has shown that he found many of his alleged victims through online dating apps for men who have sex with men, such as Manjam.com and Silverdaddies.com, stating that he wanted to meet submissive men. His alleged victims were predominantly gay men of South Asian or Middle Eastern origin.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMcArthur grew up in Kawartha Lakes, northeast of Toronto. In the 1980s he and his wife Janice were living with their two children in a house in Oshawa. He worked as a self-employed landscape gardener. At the time of his arrest in 2018, McArthur was living alone in Thorncliffe Park in central east Toronto.\n\n\n== Police investigation ==\nIn 2012, the Toronto Police Service launched Project Houston to investigate the disappearances of three men, Skandaraj Navaratnam, Abdulbasir Faizi, and Majeed Kayhan. The three men disappeared between mid-2010 and late-2012. The investigation was concluded in April 2014 due to a lack of evidence. On July 28, 2017, Project Prism was launched, using information gathered during the Project Houston investigation to investigate the disappearances of Selim Esen and Andrew Kinsman.\nToronto Police believe that Dean Lisowick was killed between May 2016 and July 2017. He had been living in The Scott Mission shelter on Spadina Avenue, and was not reported missing.\nMcArthur was first charged on January 18, 2018, with the murder of 49-year-old Andrew Kinsman and presumed death of 44-year-old Selim Esen. Both men went missing in 2017. On January 29, 2018, Toronto police laid three more first-degree murder charges against McArthur related to the disappearances of Majeed Kayhan, 58, and Soroush Mahmudi, 50, as well as the death of Dean Lisowick, 43-44, who had never been reported missing.\nIn October 2017, Toronto Police found traces of blood in a Dodge Caravan McArthur had sold to an auto parts shop on September 16, 2017. On February 8, the Toronto police recovered the remains of at least six people at a home on Mallory Crescent, where McArthur stored some of his landscaping equipment. At least some of the remains have been identified as belonging to Andrew Kinsman. Human remains were also found in planters at a Leaside home. Police believe there are more victims. Police said they were combing through five properties, four in Toronto, one in Madoc, all related to McArthur. On February 23, 2018, a sixth murder charge was laid for the muder of Skandaraj Navaratnam.\n\n\n=== Alleged victims ===\n\n\n=== Legal proceedings ===\nDetained at the Toronto South Detention Centre, McArthur made a courtroom appearance via video link on February 14, 2018. He is being represented by W. Calvin Rosemond.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe attended Fenelon Falls Secondary School in the Kawartha Lakes area. He married Janice McArthur in the mid 1980s and resided in Oshawa. The couple have a son and a daughter. He later had grandchildren. He faced financial difficulties and mortgaged his Oshawa house in 1997 and then declared bankruptcy in 1999. After being estranged from his wife, McArthur began socializing with members of Toronto's gay community. In 2003 documents show he was living in a high-rise apartment on Don Mills Road in Thorncliffe Park.\nIn 2001, he attacked a gay man with a metal pipe in Toronto. In 2003, he was convicted of the assault, and later granted a pardon. His conviction forbade him to enter Toronto's Gay Village, to approach male prostitutes, and to use poppers.\nAccording to witness accounts, McArthur was romantically linked to a Sri Lankan Tamil man named Skandaraj Navaratnam from 1999 until 2008. Navaratnam went missing in 2010, and police now suspect that he was killed by McArthur. Police also revealed McArthur and Andrew Kinsman had been involved in a sexual relationship for some time before McArthur allegedly murdered Kinsman.\n\n\n== References ==",

William attended the University of Glasgow in 1757 where he focused on his talent for learning languages. He graduated from the University in 1763 and was employed by Charles Cathcart, 9th Lord Cathcart, as tutor to his two sons. \nWilliam travelled to Russia with the Cathcart family, after Lord Cathcart was appointed ambassador to Russia in 1768. It was during these travels that Richardson described Russia through a series of letters. He later had them published, in 1784, under the title Anecdotes of the Russian Empire; in a series of letters, written, a few years ago, from St. Petersburg. These letters would later go down as a very accurate detail of Russian society.\nAfter returning to Scotland in 1772, Richardson was appointed professor of humanities at the University of Glasgow in 1773. With the ability to attract many great scholars, and also being a very popular lecturer, Glasgow became a prestigious institution. Richardson would also publish five works criticizing Shakespeare. Richardson was very interested in not only English literature, but he also read German, Italian, and French literature.\nHe died a single man in Glasgow.\n\n\n== Archives ==\nThe archives for William Richardson are maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow (GUAS).\n\n\n== References ==\n\nAttribution\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Bayne, Thomas Wilson (1896). \"Richardson, William (1743-1814)\".

            "content": "Bella Feldman is an American sculptor whose work addresses the themes of sexuality, war, and the persistent anxiety of the industrial age. Feldman is known for pioneering the use of glass with steel. Her work has affinities with Surrealism, Post-Minimalism, and the Feminist art movement, although she has no formal affiliation with these. A Professor Emeritus at the California College of the Arts, Feldman lives and works in Oakland, CA and London, England.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nBella Feldman was born in 1930 in New York City to a family of working-class Jewish immigrants from Poland. She grew up in the Bronx tenements. Feldman attended The High School of Music & Art in Manhattan during World War II. Students were required to visit museums and galleries as part of the curriculum. When Feldman was thirteen, she visited her first art museum, the Museum of Modern Art. There, she saw Meret Oppenheim's Object (1936), the fur-lined cup and saucer, and was struck by her strong psychological response to this work. Other early influences included Alberto Giacometti's The Palace at 4 am (1932) and the sculpture of David Smith. One of Feldman's earliest sculptures Warrior (1952) pays tribute to Giacometti.\nDuring the Holocaust, Feldman lost numerous family members who remained in Poland, an experience that helped shape her worldview. This includes her lifelong preoccupation with war, and the overwhelming effects of the military-industrial complex.\nFeldman received a BA from Queens College, City University of New York. She married Leonard Feldman at age 18, and moved to California with him in 1951 where they both accepted teaching positions. Feldman has two children, Nina Feldman, born 1954 and Ethan Feldman, born 1956.\nIn 1965, Feldman started teaching at the California College of the Arts. In 1971 she and her family moved to Uganda, East Africa on a grant from the E. L. Cabot Trust Fund at Harvard University. Feldman spent two years teaching art in Uganda prior to the genocidal war in that country. Upon her return to CCA, she faced gender discrimination and a threat to her job. Her successful fight to retain her position prompted her to later become an advocate for other women faculty, who she helped to achieve equity and job security. Feldman was awarded an MA in 1973 from San Jose State University. Her teachers were Sam Richardson, John Battenberg and Fletcher Benton.\n\n\n== Work ==\nMetamorphosis\nIn the 1970s, Feldman completed several installations portraying different stages of animal metamorphosis. These featured hybrid, mutant creatures, reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch's triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights\u2014rats transformed into fish, and turtles with human features. The small-scale sculptures were displayed in large clusters, their multitude invoking aggression and infestation. Birds (1970), a cast metal flock of dead birds, preceded Kiki Smith's Jersey Crows (1995) while Metamorphic Turtles (1973\u201375) anticipated Smith's Sirens and Harpies (2002).\nWar Toys and War Toys Redux\nWar Toys (1992) is a series created in response to the first Gulf War. Feldman was incensed by the tone of admiration she heard in President George Bush's voice when he referred to the Patriot missile. These works mocked the allure of weaponry and perceived glory in violence. The War Toys series relates to Magdalena Abakanowicz's War Games' sculptures (1989), giant monstrous weapons made of metal and wood. However, the scale and sensuality of Feldman's War Toys strip them of power. The series is in the tradition of contemporary women artists' critique of war that entwines images of male sexuality and military aggression. Examples include Nancy Spero's The War Series (1966\u201370), a response to the Vietnam War, and Judith Bernstein's Iraq Travel Poster (1969).\nWar Toys Redux (2003) evoked a different kind of mutation: the metal sculptures represented a hybrid between organic and machine forms. This adaptation continued the series with a new medium, combining blown glass with steel armatures. The sensuality of soft, bulbous glass forms reinforced the vision of earlier War Toys, effeminizing the objects of aggression and rendering them impotent.\nFlasks of Fiction\nFeldman pioneered the technique of blowing glass into metal forms in the late 1990s. The first series of mostly hanging sculptures Flasks of Fiction (1998\u20132001) were originally inspired by the lanterns in mosques Feldman visited while in Turkey. She said of these: \u201cI combined glass and metal to suggest vulnerability and constraint as well as seduction.\u201d Flasks of Fiction aligns Feldman with Post-Minimalist sculptors, such as Eva Hesse, who explored the inherent properties of materials and experimented with tension that results from binding bulging forms or upholding drooping forms. In Flasks of Fiction, hardened materials such as glass and steel make explicit references to bodies and sexuality, making the viewer respond viscerally to the corporeal hybrids.\nLarge Sculpture\nSince 2003, Feldman has created a number of large-scale sculptures that embody her lifelong interest in process and materials. Combining metal and glass, organic forms and machine parts, aggression and vulnerability, such works as Dyad (2003) and Jacob's Ladder (2011) refer to Martin Puryear in scale and to Louise Bourgeois in psychic intensity.\n\n\n== Exhibitions, Collections, Awards ==\nFeldman has won numerous awards for her work, and her sculpture is featured in private and museum collections, including the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the di Rosa Preserve, Napa, CA, and the Palm Springs Desert Museum. Her work has been exhibited nationally and internationally at museums and galleries including The Oakland Museum of California; the Berkeley Art Museum; Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, Lausanne, Switzerland; the Alternative Museum, New York; the Contemporary Jewish Museum San Francisco; Habatat Galleries, Chicago and Royal Oaks, MI; and Jan Baum Gallery, Los Angeles. Feldman was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts Individual Artists award in 1986 and received Distinguished Artist Awards from Kala Art Institute, Berkeley, CA (2004), and Women's Caucus for the Arts (2005). A fifty-year survey of her work took place at The Richmond Art Center, Richmond, CA in 2013.\n\n\n== References ==\nSelz, Peter.

            "content": "The Night of the Ducks (Hebrew: \u05dc\u05d9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d1\u05e8\u05d5\u05d5\u05d6\u05d9\u05dd\u200e) was the civilian fiasco by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that occurred on April 1, 1959.\nTraditionally, Israel conducted regular call-up exercises for its reserve troops by public radio. Units were given code words, which, if broadcast over the radio, meant that the troops were to assemble at predetermined meeting points. Though intended for emergency use, exercises were conducted to ensure that the troops arrived at their appointed places within a reasonable amount of time. Because of the tense situation along the country's borders, drills were announced publicly well in advance, and people expecting to be called up waited at home for the announcements to be made.\nBy the late 1950s, however, tensions had been increasing along Israel's frontiers, not least because of the perceived threat posed by the political unification of the country's two major adversaries, Egypt and Syria, as the United Arab Republic on January 31, 1958. As a result, it was decided by the IDF's General Staff to test the readiness of its reserve troops under actual emergency conditions. A call-up exercise would be conducted, but unlike previous exercises, there would be no prior announcement and no warning given.\nOn April 1, a popular radio program on Kol Israel was interrupted by a message requesting listeners to stay close to their radios and wait for an important announcement. At 9:00 PM, Kol Israel's main radio program opened with an announcement of a general call-up of the reserves, and all reservists whose units were announced were requested to report to their bases the following day. The message was concluded with three military code words, which signaled units to report at their predetermined meeting points. The message was delivered in nine languages.\nIntended to simulate genuine emergency conditions, the call-up announcement threw the country into a panic. People believed that the call-up was in response to a genuine emergency, and that the country was under attack. In the following hours, Israelis spread rumors and guesses, and checked their personal ammunition supply. In the Knesset, members received the news during a vote on the state budget, and quickly abandoned the proceedings and ran to their cars to listen to the radio.\nLess than a quarter of an hour after the broadcast, radio programs from all over the world began announcing that Israel was mobilizing its army. Urgent messages were sent to foreign reporters in Israel, most of whom were attending a festival at Tel Aviv's Cultural Center celebrating a state visit to Israel by the Queen Elisabeth of Belgium. IDF Chief of Staff Haim Laskov and Chief of Reserves Meir Zorea were also attending. Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had been entertaining Queen Elisabeth when the crisis began.\nSimilarly, the neighboring Arab states, which monitored Israeli radio, believed that Israel was preparing to launch a surprise attack on them, and began to ready their own troops. Syria began moving troops to the Israeli border to prepare for an IDF attack. It took considerable efforts by the government to calm the civilian population, and international efforts to mollify the neighboring states and convince them that Israel was not preparing for war.\nAt 11:00 PM, Kol Israel finally announced that the call-up had been just an exercise, but people in Israel and abroad began forming conspiracy theories. For example, Soviet media claimed that the mobilization was possibly \"to divert the workers' attention and to allow the government to insert into the defense clause of the budget 420 million Lirot, more than the previous year\".\nIn the following days, the local press responded bitterly to the event, referring to it as the \"Night of the Ducks\", since one of the call-up codes repeated on the radio was \"Waterfowl\", which in Hebrew translates as \"water ducks\". An official Commission of Inquiry was organized to investigate the decisions leading up to the event. Although the Chief of Staff, Chaim Laskov, was absolved, two leading generals, Major General Meir Zorea, who served as Chief of Reserves, and Major General Yehoshafat Harkabi, who served as Chief of Military Intelligence, were forced to step down.\n\n\n== External links ==",

It was the first single since \"A View to a Kill\" in 1985 to feature all five of the original members of the band.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe video was directed by Michael and Mark Polish (aka the Polish Brothers), and featured each band member on their own journey across various landscapes, only to be joined together on a stage before an intense sunrise for the chorus.\nEach band member's storyline was filmed in a different film or digital format, creating a very different look for each set of scenes. Several versions of the video were made available on the Internet, with each version focusing on the storyline of one band member.\nThe band always plays the Jason Nevins version live in concert. The version on the album also incorporates parts from the Jason Nevins version, to which he is credited in the liner notes on the album.\n\n\n== Covers, samples, & media references ==\nAt the end of an episode of Las Vegas, the band appeared, performing the song in the Montecito as was normal during the Second Season.\nAs of 2005, a remix of the song is used in the beginning sequence of the television programme Sunrise on Seven Network in Australia. It was also used in Telecom Italia Mobile commercials with Adriana Lima.

Their music incorporates styles such as thrash metal, death metal, industrial metal, grunge and some traces of gypsy jazz.\n\n\n== History ==\nD\u00e5\u00e5th was started by Eyal Levi and Mike Kameron, who had been playing in bands since they were in middle school. The two friends attended Berklee College of Music in Boston but eventually left school to concentrate full-time on making money. The band was originally known as Dirt Nap before the name change in 2004.\nD\u00e5\u00e5th's first album, Futility, was self-released in 2004. Their Roadrunner Records debut, The Hinderers, was released in March 2007. D\u00e5\u00e5th have so far released two music videos from The Hinderers, the first being \"Festival Mass Soulform,\" which was created prior to getting signed, and helped them gain Roadrunner's interest. The second video, \"Subterfuge,\" was released in February 2007.\nIn March 2007, D\u00e5\u00e5th was confirmed to play the second stage (rotating slots) at Ozzfest.

To end the album cycle, D\u00e5\u00e5th performed three shows in Japan with Zyklon.\nThe band's third album The Concealers was released on April 21, 2009 by Century Media Records via a partnership with Roadrunner Records. D\u00e5\u00e5th released one music video from \"The Concealers\" which was for the song \"Day Of Endless Light.\" There was a good bit of touring behind \"The Concealers\" as well. Spring of 2009 featured a full US tour with Dragonforce and Cynic. Summer was the full US and Canada with Goatwhore and Abigail Williams. That fall D\u00e5\u00e5th returned to Europe with Chimaira, Unearth, and Throwdown.\nDuring the break between the final tour for \"The Concealers\" album cycle and the writing sessions for the upcoming D\u00e5\u00e5th album, guitarists Eyal Levi, and Emil Werstler released an instrumental CD entitled \"Avalanche of Worms.\" It was released April 20, 2010, via Magna Carta Records under the artist name Levi/Werstler. Sean Reinert from Cynic (ex Death) played the drums on it.\nD\u00e5\u00e5th released their fourth studio album in October 2010 via Century Media Records.\nIn 2011 it was revealed that Emil Werstler, and Sean Zatorsky would be filling the vacant Bass and Keyboard/Vocal (respectively) duties for Chimaira.

The studio opened in 2000, and has offices in Los Angeles, New York City and Vancouver. Some of their productions include Motorcity for Disney XD, Metalocalypse, China, IL, Superjail! and Black Dynamite for Adult Swim.\n\n\n== History ==\nOwner Chris Prynoski began working at MTV in New York on shows such as Daria, Beavis and Butthead, and his own creation, MTV Downtown, which was nominated for a primetime Emmy Award. In the early 2000s, Prynoski opened a small T-shirt company with his wife, Shannon Prynoski. However, upon getting more requests for cartoons than for T-shirts, they decided to abandon screen-printing in favor of animation. The Prynoski's moved to California and opened the revamped Titmouse, Inc., an animation studio. They hired French art director, Antonio Canobbio. Titmouse opened a games division in 2009.\nDue to projects like Cartoon Network\u2019s Metalocalypse, Superjail! and The Venture Bros. the company expanded and opened a sister studio in New York City in 2010. The California studio later added a wholly owned subsidiary, Robin Redbreast, which was then unionized in order to produce MotorCity for Disney XD.\nThe company has a YouTube channel, Rug Burn, launched in December 2012 with Six Point Harness. Rug Burn was launched with a handful of shows.\nIn April 2016, Titmouse released its first feature-length film, titled Nerdland. The film is R-rated, and stars Paul Rudd and Patton Oswalt.\n\n\n== Subsidiaries ==\nTitmouse Canada\nTitmouse New York\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Feature films ===\nFreddy Got Fingered (animated sequence and artwork) (2001)\nWonderland (\"Divee the Loot\" sequence) (2003)\nSunset Strip (animation) (2012)\nGirl Rising (\"Egypt\" sequence) (2013)\nHer (Giant Man Sequence) (2013)\nTeam Hot Wheels: The Origins of Awesome!

            "content": "Jenny Wai Ching Kwan (born 1967) is a Hong Kong-born Canadian politician. She was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of British Columbia for the riding of Vancouver-Mount Pleasant, and a senior member of the provincial caucus of the New Democratic Party. After serving for 20 years in the provincial legislative assembly, she was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2015 election, representing Vancouver East.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nKwan emigrated to Canada at age nine with her family from Hong Kong. She speaks English, French, and Cantonese. Kwan graduated from Simon Fraser University with a Bachelor of Arts in Criminology. She worked as a community legal advocate in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside before entering politics. The Downtown Eastside is known as a troubled and impoverished area inhabited mainly by new immigrants and ethnic minorities.\n\n\n== Political career ==\n\n\n=== Vancouver city councillor ===\nIn 1993, Kwan at age 26 was elected as the youngest-ever member of Vancouver City Council. She was the sole representative of the civic party known as COPE throughout her term on council.\n\n\n=== Provincial politics ===\nIn 1996, Kwan entered provincial politics. After being nominated, she was elected as the MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant, in East Vancouver. She succeeded Premier Mike Harcourt, who at the time had just resigned over a series of serious fundraising scandals, including the Bingogate Scandal\nIn 2001, Kwan, along with Joy MacPhail, was one of only two NDP MLAs to survive the party's electoral collapse in the British Columbia general election, 2001 at the hands of a BC Liberal landslide upset. She was re-elected in 2005, 2009, and 2013.\n\n\n=== Leadership controversy, December 2010 ===\nIn December 2010, Kwan released a statement to the media criticizing NDP party leader Carole James, and calling for an immediate leadership convention, after party candidates suffered defeat in the 2009 election. In response to Kwan's statement, James called an emergency caucus session to address opposition to her continued leadership. Before the caucus meeting was held, however, James announced her resignation as party leader. While Kwan was accused of self-interest, at the time she claimed to have no plans to run for the leadership of the party.\n\n\n=== Portland Hotel Society controversy, March 2014 ===\nIn March 2014, an audit of the Portland Hotel Society showed that Kwan's ex-husband, Dan Small, had improperly expensed the cost of a family Disneyland trip to the Society. At the time of the trip, Kwan had still been married to Small and had participated in the trip with their children. When the audit became public, Kwan held a press conference where she denied any knowledge that the Society had paid for the trip, and said she would reimburse the Society. Following the conference, Kwan took a brief leave of absence.\n\n\n=== Election to the House of Commons ===\nIn January 2015, Kwan announced that she would be seeking the New Democratic Party of Canada nomination in Vancouver East for the 2015 federal election. Mable Elmore was also seeking the party's nomination in the riding. Kwan was nominated on March 22, and sought to replace Libby Davies as the Member of Parliament for the riding. She was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in October 2015, defeating Liberal Party candidate Edward Wong and Conservative Party candidate James Low by a wide margin. On November 12, she was appointed as her party's critic for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship.\n\n\n== Electoral Record ==\n\n\n=== Federal ===\n\n\n=== Provincial ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese Canadians in British Columbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Biography, Legislative Assembly of British Columbia\nBiography, New Democratic Party\nJenny Kwan on IMDb",

There is substantial variation within this range, and the Green Acouchi, as currently recognized, may contain more than one species. Because the application of the scientific name acouchy, currently in use for the Red Acouchi, has historically been disputed, the name Myoprocta acouchy has sometimes been used for this species instead of Myoprocta pratti. The species is named for Antwerp Edgar Pratt who was a British naturalist.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAn adult green acouchi weighs around 1 kilogram (2.2 lb), and has a short tail. The acouchi is a frugivore and so is prone to the dental disease caries.\n\n\n== Behavior ==\nGreen acouchis are diurnal, surface dwelling rodents and have a complex array of behavior patterns relating to social interaction. In addition, they are food hoarders, employing a scatter hoarding strategy.\n\n\n== Reproduction ==\nFemale acouchis have an average oestrus cycle length of around 43 days and have a set breeding season between autumn-spring with a 99-day gestation. Females produce small litters of relatively precocial young, mothers produce a 'purring' vocalisation to maintain contact with young. Unusually pregnant acouchis do not specifically nest build but will instead choose a preferred nest site for the first week of lactation. Mothers can become very aggressive after parturition and raise their litters in isolation; weaning is extended and young remain with the mother for several weeks or months post-weaning to benefit from the mother's protection.\n\n\n== References ==",

The title was inspired by a passage in Charles Dickens' Bleak House: \"I only ask to be free. The butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies.\"\nAfter twelve previews, the Broadway production, directed by Milton Katselas, opened on October 21, 1969, at the Booth Theatre, where it ran for 1128 performances. The original cast consisted of Keir Dullea, Blythe Danner, Eileen Heckart, and Paul Michael Glaser. Replacements during the run included Gloria Swanson, Pamela Bellwood, Kipp Osborne and David Huffman. Stephen Schwartz composed the title song.\nGershe, Katselas, Heckart, and Glaser were reunited for the 1972 screen adaptation (set in San Francisco) with Edward Albert and Goldie Hawn.\n\n\n== Broadway awards and nominations ==\nTony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play (Danner, winner; Heckart, nominee)\nTony Award for Best Direction of a Play (nominee)\nTheatre World Award (Dullea's replacement Kipp Osborne, winner)\nClarence Derwent Award for female supporting performances on Broadway (Pamela Bellwood)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nButterflies Are Free at the Internet Broadway Database",

He is known for having performed ten spacewalks so far in his career, presently holding the second longest all-time EVA duration record and having the third longest spaceflight of any American at the length of 215 days; this time was spent on board the ISS from September 18, 2006 to April 21, 2007.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHe was born in Madrid, Spain and raised in Mission Viejo, California. L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda joined the United States Navy, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering in 1980 from the United States Naval Academy, and a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1988 from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School. Designated a Naval Aviator in 1981, his fleet experience in the Navy was at Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 (VQ-2) in Rota, Spain, and the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. A natural leader, he was the top Lieutenant of 60 in the second largest aviation wardroom in the Navy (105 officers). He made many connections with Spanish military and civilian personnel while in Spain during his first tour that have made him very popular and well known in Spanish media. He was one of the few EP-3E pilots in the squadron to get flying time in the EA-3B Skywarrior. He is a graduate of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security. He is fluent in English, Spanish, French, and Russian.\nHis son Nicolas starred alongside L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda in 2006 in Mira La Luna (directed by Eduard Bosch). A second documentary, directed by Manuel Huerga, Son And Moon, was released in Spanish theaters in 2009 featuring astronauts Mikhail Tyurin, Sunita Williams, and himself.\n\n\n== Mission record ==\n\nL\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda's first space mission was STS-73 in 1995; for several years afterwards he led NASA's International Space Station (ISS) Crew Operations office before returning to space aboard STS-92 in 2000 and STS-113 in 2002. During flight STS-92, he tested the SAFER jet backpack with fellow astronaut Jeff Wisoff, flying up to 50 feet from the spacecraft.\nL\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001.\nOn September 20, 2006 L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda docked with the ISS as Commander of Expedition 14, having taken off from Baikonur, Kazakhstan on September 18, onboard Soyuz TMA-9. On Expedition 14, he performed five spacewalks. On April 21, 2007 he undocked from the ISS and returned to Earth.\nL\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda holds the all time American record for number of EVAs (10) and total EVA duration (67 hours and 40 minutes). The previous record holder, Jerry L. Ross had a total of 9 EVAs with a duration of 58 hours and 18 minutes. L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda is the second most experienced spacewalker overall, behind Russia's Anatoly Solovyev. On April 2, 2007, L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda set the record for the longest space mission of any American astronaut. When he landed on April 21, his time in space on a single mission was 215 days. (The longest space mission on record is that of Valeriy Polyakov, who spent 437 days aboard the Russian space station Mir in 1994 and 1995.)\n\n\n== Promotional activities and current assignment ==\nOn October 19, 2007, L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda visited his old high school Mission Viejo High School, where he told the students about his space travel expedition.\n\n\n== List of EVAs ==\n\n2000-10-16 7:07 hours STS-92, EVA 2\n2000-10-18 6:56 hours STS-92, EVA 4\n2002-11-26 6:45 hours STS-113, EVA 1\n2002-11-28 6:10 hours STS-113, EVA 2\n2002-11-30 7:00 hours STS-113, EVA 3\n2006-11-22 7:39 hours ISS Expedition 14, EVA 1\n2007-01-31 7:55 hours ISS Expedition 14, EVA 2\n2007-02-04 7:11 hours ISS Expedition 14, EVA 3\n2007-02-07 6:39 hours ISS Expedition 14, EVA 4\n2007-02-22 6:18 hours ISS Expedition 14, EVA 5\nAt the end of his mission, he commanded the longest flight by a Soyuz spacecraft, making Expedition 14 the longest expedition thus far. L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda broke the record for longest spaceflight by an American astronaut.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\nL\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda retired from NASA on March 12, 2012 and served as the President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation through the end of 2014. L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda is now an independent consultant to traditional and commercial space companies, serves on several advisory boards and committees to public and private organizations, and is engaged in public speaking domestically and internationally. He is based in Washington, DC.\n\n\n== Awards and decorations ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHispanics in the United States Naval Academy\nList of Hispanic astronauts\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpacefacts biography of Michael L\u00f3pez-Alegr\u00eda",

It was founded by Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad (1537\u20131612), a follower of the famous mystic Muhammad al-Jazuli. The ruins of the town of Dila are situated just south of the city of Khenifra.\nUnder the leadership of Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, the brotherhood was able to establish itself in the Berber territory of the Middle Atlas and High Atlas mountain ranges. From 1637 onwards, the brotherhood started with the conquest of large parts of northern Morocco. By 1641, they had conquered Rabat, Meknes and Fes. Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was assassinated that year. In Fes, the Saadi family was expelled and Muhammad al-Hajj (1635\u20131688) was proclaimed sultan.\nThe Dila'ites would rule over central and northern Morocco until 1668, when Dila itself was annexed by the shurafa Alaouites and Fes was taken.\n\n\n== References ==",

The project additionally includes another CD including two newly recorded songs and four previously-released remixes, and a second DVD with ten live performances filmed during The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u201314).\nHer fourth EP, titled Beyonc\u00e9: More Only was digitally released alongside the box set, offering the newly released material as an individual collection. The EP debuted at number 8 on the Billboard 200, selling 43,000 copies in its first week, but also garnered an additional 28,000 in album equivalent units. The release was promoted with the release of Flawless Remix in the United States as the lead single from the box set on August 12, 2014 followed by 7/11 on November 25, 2014\n\n\n== Background and release ==\nBeyonc\u00e9 unexpectedly released her self-titled fifth studio album on December 13, 2013, without prior announcement. The record was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with three-day sales of 617,000 copies, and remained at the summit of the chart for three consecutive weeks. Additionally, the release has sold five million copies as of November 2014. Reports of a follow-up record first surfaced in November 2014, at which time it was widely speculated that Beyonc\u00e9 would release a second volume of the project on November 25 without prior promotion. After that it was confirmed that a reportedly-leaked track listing for the record was \"completely made up\". Parkwood Entertainment instead announced that Beyonc\u00e9 would be reissued in an expanded four-disc box set subtitled the Platinum Edition.\nThe Platinum Edition was released through physical retailers and online music stores on November 24, 2014; it was simultaneously made available on Spotify for the first time since the original record was premiered. The box set is packaged with the audio and visual discs from the original record, a DVD subtitled Live with ten performances filmed during The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u201314), a six-track CD subtitled More, and a smaller version of the official 2015 Beyonc\u00e9 calendar. Live and More were digitally released as a standalone extended play through the iTunes Store and Amazon.com; the audio material was made available as individual downloads on Google Play.\n\n\n== New material ==\nOf the six tracks included on More Only, four are remixes of the previously released songs, and two are newly recorded songs. \"7/11\", which is an uptempo hip hop piece, features Auto-Tune in its composition. The track incorporates several rapping verses by Beyonc\u00e9. Caitlin White from MTV News likened the song's production to that of Beyonc\u00e9's \"Bow Down / I Been On\", which was released in March 2013. Lyrically, \"7/11\" is about Beyonc\u00e9's detailing her dance moves: \"I put up my hands up, spinning while my hands up / [...] Legs move it side to side, smack in the air.\" \"Ring Off\" is described as a midtempo reggae ballad that features dancehall rhythms with slight elements of dubstep. The track, in which she sings: \"Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights / When you think about father / and how you tried to be the perfect wife... I wish you didn't hurt at all,\" addresses the end of a marriage between Beyonc\u00e9's parents, Tina and Mathew Knowles. \"Standing on the Sun\" is an uptempo reggae-inflected song with an island/Caribbean flavor to it. It originally was meant for the album along with Grown Woman, however it was removed from the track list around October 2013.\nThe extended play version of \"Drunk in Love\" features a guest appearance from Kanye West, who provided vocals for the official remix; the song features an explicit verse by himself and a slightly modified instrumental produced by Mike Dean. In his lines, West rapped about his wife Kim Kardashian and referenced the video for his own song, \"Bound 2\" (2013). Musically, the remix to \"Flawless\" was noted for being a slower version of the original and containing new, sexually explicit verses. It also contains a sample from the horns of Outkast's song \"Spottieottiedopaliscious\". Nicki Minaj provides a rapid-fire delivery using a low timbre. Her lyrics reference the work of Kanye West on the song \"Monster\", her own success and compares her detractors with Michael Jackson's convicted doctor through numerous punch lines.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBen Sisario from The New York Times commented that the Platinum Edition continued the trend of \"repackaging hit albums with some extra content\" in order to maintain a successful commercial performance. Furthermore, he noted that Iggy Azalea reissued her debut studio album The New Classic (2014) as Reclassified and that Paramore re-released their self-titled fourth studio album (2013) in a deluxe version the same day that Beyonc\u00e9 launched her repackage. However, Trans World Entertainment vice president for music merchandising Ish Cuebas acknowledged that initial interest in the Platinum Edition appeared \"light\".\nIn a review for Cuepoint, Robert Christgau gave the Platinum Edition an \"A\" grade and argued that, unlike most superfluous live DVDs, the third disc \"rules, not just for Ms. Knowles's legendary stage discipline and expert dance routines but for a star-time visage further beautified by how readily it projects empathy, humor, and fun to fans who get it all\". He concluded that the fourth disc More is the \"best Bey ever\" because it abandoned the tedious themes of dignity present on the original album in favor of more lustful, erotic songs. Christgau ranked its More Only portion as the seventh best album of 2014 in his year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Beyonc\u00e9: Platinum Edition.\nNotes\n^[a] signifies a co-producer\n^[b] signifies an additional producer\n^[c] signifies a re-mixer\nAll tracks feature vocal production by Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles\n\"No Angel\" is stylized as \"Angel\"\n\"Flawless\" is stylized as \"***Flawless\"\nSampling credits\n\"Partition\" contains an interpolation of the French-dubbed version of the 1998 film The Big Lebowski, performed by Hajiba Fahmy.\n\"***Flawless\" contains portions of the speech \"We should all be feminists\", delivered by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.\n\"Heaven\" contains portions of \"The Lord's Prayer\" in Spanish, recited by Melissa Vargas.\n\"Flawless Remix\" contains a sample of \"SpottieOttieDopaliscious\" by OutKast.\n\"Drunk in Love Remix\" contains a sample of Kanye West's \"Flashing Lights\", vocals provided by Connie Mitchell.\n\"Ring Off\" contains portions of a speech delivered by Tina Knowles at the 2014 Texas Women's Empowerment Foundation Leadership Luncheon.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n=== Album charts ===\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

They are large and elongated: females of the largest species, Kr\u00f8yer's deep sea angler fish, Ceratias holboelli, reach 1.2 m (3.9 ft) in length. Males, by contrast, are much smaller, reaching 14 cm (5.5 in), and, like other anglerfishes, spend much of their lives attached to a female after a free-living adolescent stage in which they are very small - at most 1.3 cm (0.51 in) - and have sharp, beak-like, toothless jaws. One or more males attach themselves permanently to a female, eventually merging circulatory systems. As this genetic chimera matures, the male grows large testicles, while the rest of its body atrophies. Ceratiidea are the only creatures known to become chimeras as a normal part of their lifecycle.\n\n\n== References ==",

The structure of the individual zooids is generally simple, a box-like chamber of calcium carbonate, the polypides reaching out through an uncalcified flexible frontal wall, often surrounded by numerous spines. Like in other gymnolaematans, their lophophore is protruded by muscles that pull on the frontal wall of the zooid.\nIn some treatments, the Flustrina are restricted to the superfamilies Calloporoidea and Flustroidea and ranked as infraorder alongside the Cellulariomorpha which contain the other three superfamilies. What here is considered the Fulstrina is then called the infraorder Neocheilostomina, and in a more radical variant also includes the Ascophora as another infraorder.\nThe obsolete sub-order Anasca previously included the members of this sub-order before being deprecated.\nThe families Fusicellariidae, Skyloniidae, Bicorniferidae, as well as the genera Hoeverella and Taeniocellaria are currently incertae sedis within the Flustrina.\n\n\n== Systematics ==\nThe superfamilies and families (and notable genera) are listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence:\n\n\n== See also ==\nCauloramphus disjunctus\nFlustra foliacea\n\n\n== References ==",

Tennessee voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine.\nOn March 1, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Tennessee voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote.\nDonald Trump won the election in Tennessee with 60.7% of the vote. Hillary Clinton received 34.7% of the vote. This is the largest margin of victory for a presidential candidate for either party since 1972 with Richard Nixon, and the first time since that either party has earned over 60% of the vote in Tennessee.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTennessee has not voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1996. In 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney won the state by a margin of more than twenty points, due to the unpopularity of the Obama Administration in a conservative state. Typically Democrats do very well in the urban regions of Memphis and Nashville, while Republicans dominate the rural and suburban areas. Tennessee is considered a safe Republican state. In 2016, it stayed that way with Trump winning the state with 60.7% of the vote.\n\n\n== Primary elections ==\n\n\n=== Democratic primary ===\n\nResults\n\n\n=== Republican primary ===\n\n\n=== Polling ===\n\n\n== General election ==\n\n\n=== By congressional district ===\nTrump won 7 of 9 congressional districts.\n\n\n=== Counties that swung from Democratic to Republican ===\nHardeman (largest city: Bolivar)\n\n\n== See also ==\nDemocratic Party presidential debates, 2016\nDemocratic Party presidential primaries, 2016\nRepublican Party presidential debates, 2016\nRepublican Party presidential primaries, 2016\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRNC 2016 Republican Nominating Process\nGreen papers for 2016 primaries, caucuses, and conventions\n2016 Presidential primaries, ElectionProjection.com\nDecision Desk Headquarter Results for Tennessee",

            "content": "Birkenhead Park railway station is a two platform through station situated in Birkenhead, Wirral, England. It lies on the Wirral Line 3 1\u20442 miles (5.6 km) west of Liverpool Lime Street on the Merseyrail network.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name of the station comes from nearby Birkenhead Park, one of the UK's first Victorian municipal parks. In 1850 its layout - created by Joseph Paxton - had a profound influence on visiting American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Eight years later he took inspiration from Birkenhead Park (and other green spaces like Derby Arboretum) to win a competition to design New York's new city park.\nThe station was opened on 2 January 1888, as a joint interchange station between the Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway and the Mersey Railway. The station replaced the Wirral Railway's original terminus at Wallasey Bridge Road, which was close to the present-day Birkenhead North station. The station was an interchange between the Wirral Railway's line to West Kirby and the Mersey Railway's new line to Liverpool Central low level station. On the same day of opening, the Wirral Railway's new line to Wallasey Grove Road opened, which was extended to New Brighton later the same year.\nThe station was built at the western portal of the Mersey Railway tunnel that ran into central Birkenhead and Liverpool's city centre. From its opening the station had two island platforms to facilitate across-platform transfer between the Mersey Railway and the Wirral Railway. The northern pair of tracks were used exclusively by Mersey Railway trains. The centre and southern pairs of tracks were available to the Wirral Railway.\n\n\n=== Mersey Railway electrification ===\n\nOn 3 May 1903, the Mersey Railway to Liverpool was changed over from steam to electric trains, with a 650v DC fourth rail system and Mersey Railway electric units built by Westinghouse.\nThere was a small Mersey Railway electric car shed at the eastern end of the station, on the northern side of the line, which held two 6-car trains. This was built on level ground, with the tracks towards the tunnel to Liverpool dropping steeply alongside. The car shed was removed in the 1970s.\n\n\n=== Fatal accident ===\nOn 6 December 1922 an accident occurred at the station, at around 4pm, between two trains of the Wirral Railway. The train heading to West Kirby, which was late, was leaving the station and collided with a train from West Kirby. There was one fatality and eight other passengers sustained serious injuries, with a further 36 people suffering from shock. This was the first fatal passenger accident to occur on the Wirral Railway.\n\n\n=== LMS electrification ===\n\nBetween 1936 and 1938, The London, Midland and Scottish Railway electrified the lines from Birkenhead Park to West Kirby and New Brighton using a 650v DC third rail to match the system of the Mersey Railway. The smoke free electric trains facilitated through operation to underground sections of Birkenhead and Liverpool, with the line terminating at Liverpool Central low level station. The LMS electric trains were brought into passenger service on 14 March 1938. The need to change at Birkenhead Park was removed transforming the station into a through station. It was normal for the new LMS trains to operate the Liverpool to West Kirby route, and the older Mersey Railway trains to operate the Liverpool to New Brighton route, except for Sundays and bank holidays.\nFrom 1938 electrification of the Wirral lines integrated both the Mersey Railway and LMS (Wirral) railway services to New Brighton and West Kirby. However the former Wirral Railway branch to Seacombe was still operated by steam trains, not those of its owner the LMS but trains of the LNER from the Chester and Wrexham lines through Bidston. The additional facilities beyond a simple two-track through station became redundant at Birkenhead Park. Despite which, the layout retained all four platforms, two in each direction, until the 1970s. A new 60-lever signal box was opened in 1938, which was reduced to 25 levers in 1972 and which closed on 28 February 1988.\n\n\n=== World War II bombing ===\nThe station building is not the original. The first station building was destroyed when two land mines were dropped by German aircraft on the night of 12\u201313 March 1941, during the Second World War. After the bombing, through services were restored after five days with the station reopened to passengers after eleven days.\n\n\n=== Post War ===\n\nThe outer platform faces were hardly used, apart from a handful of trains which were stored outside of peak hours in the sidings which remained at all four corners of the station, and outside the island platforms. In the 1970s, there were a number of rationalisations to the layout. At one stage, through trains used the outer tracks of the station, while a bay platform was fashioned between these to allow a proposed Liverpool to Birkenhead Park extra peak hour shuttle service, which in the event was never started. The layout was then simplified again to the current one, retaining the former southern island platform with just a through road either side, with the former northern platform demolished in 1992.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe station is staffed, during all opening hours, and has platform CCTV. The island platform has a waiting shelter. There is a payphone, booking office and live departure and arrival screens, for passenger information. Wheelchair and pram access to the platform is possible, and also relatively easy, via the ramp-staircase. The station has no car park but there is secure cycle storage for 32 bikes and facilities to rent bikes as part of Merseyrail's Go Cycle scheme.\n\n\n== Services ==\nTrains operate every 15 minutes (Monday to Saturday daytime) to New Brighton and West Kirby and every 5\u201310 minutes via Hamilton Square and the Mersey Railway Tunnel to Liverpool. At other times, trains run every 30 minutes to New Brighton and West Kirby, and every 15 minutes to Liverpool. These services are all provided by Merseyrail's fleet of Class 507 and Class 508 EMUs.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nGahan, John W. (1983).

The College also owns a 562-acre (2.27 km2) farm which serves as a field laboratory. The farm includes grain storage facilities, cattle growing and finishing facilities, and a completely diversified dry land and irrigated farming operation.\nThe Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture was established in 1965 as a land-grant institution - known at that time as UNSTA, the University of Nebraska School of Technical Agriculture. It was started in 1913 as a regional, residential high school providing education to students from throughout the Sandhills region, southwest and western Nebraska. According to a researcher at Cornell College in Iowa, NCTA is the oldest college campus that was previously a high school and is still functioning today as an educational institution.\nThe first high school students began classes in Agriculture Hall (shown in the photo) on Sept. 8, 1913 at the Nebraska School of Agriculture (NSA). In 1946, the high school's title changed to the University of Nebraska School of Agriculture (UNSA). The college, UNSTA, began in 1965 with the UNSA high school operating classes on campus simultaneously for three years until the Medicine Valley Public School opened its new high school. Stan Matzke was UNSTA's first superintendent from 1965-1968, followed by Bill Siminoe from 1968-1995.\nThe college's name officially changed from the University of Nebraska School of Technical Agriculture (UNSTA) to the University of Nebraska - Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture (NCTA) in February, 1994. Don Woodburn served as NCTA Dean from 1995 to 2004, with Jerry Sundquist of Curtis as interim dean, when Weldon Sleight came on board in 2006 until December, 2012. Ron Rosati became NCTA Dean on July 1, 2013.\nIn November, 2013, NCTA celebrated the college's 50th anniversary with a gathering of alumni, former superintendents and deans, students and the Curtis community. A 50th anniversary booklet shared highlights from the institution's history as a high school and college. Dean Rosati described the anniversary and historical significance in a Dean's Column, \"Building upon NCTA's history.\" \n\n\n== Campus Centers ==\nNCTA and its earlier institutions have continually operated with business offices and the administration located in the first building on campus, Agriculture Hall at 404 East 7th Street, Curtis. See campus map\nFacilities include four residence halls, a dining hall, library, historic Student Activities Center/Student Union (known as The Barn), the Everett Stencel Livestock Teaching Center and indoor arena which houses animal and equine sciences and agricultural education; a 225-seat auditorium and Student Services Welcome Center at the Nebraska Agriculture Industry Education Center, which also houses agronomy, chemistry and biology classrooms and laboratories; and the Veterinary Technology Systems Complex and Dr. Walter Long Teaching Clinic. Additional classrooms and labs are included for agricultural equipment management (welding, electricity, irrigation technology) and greenhouses for horticulture.

            "content": "Tadashi Hanaya (\u82b1\u8c37\u6b63, Hanaya Tadashi, 5 January 1894 \u2013 28 August 1957) was a general in the Imperial Japanese Army, commanding Japanese ground forces in Burma during World War II.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHanaya was born in Katsuta District, Okayama as the son of a village headman. He attended military preparatory schools, and graduated from the 26th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in May 1914 and was initially assigned to the IJA 54th Infantry Regiment. He graduated from the 34th class of the Army Staff College in November 1922.\nHanaya served in the early portion of his career in the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office, and was also stationed at Zhengzhou in China under orders from the Kwantung Army. In August 1929, he became a battalion commander with the IJA 37th Infantry Regiment. As a major in 1931, he was assigned to the military intelligence section of the Kwantung Army and served as head of the Mukden Special Operations Office. In this capacity, he was deeply involved in planning the Mukden Incident with General Seishiro Itagaki and General Kanji Ishihara, which led to the subsequent Japanese occupation of Manchuria. Hanaya subsequently commanded a battalion of the IJA 35th Regiment and returned to the staff of the Kwantung Army in 1935, and the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in 1936. In August 1937, Hanaya was promoted to colonel, and was given command of the IJA 43rd Infantry Regiment. This regiment was involved in combat in Shanghai around the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. He was appointed head of the Japanese military delegation to Manchukuo in 1939, following the Nomonhan Incident.\nIn March 1940, Hanaya was promoted to major general and was given command of the IJA 29th Infantry Brigade. He subsequently served as commander of the infantry group of the IJA 29th Infantry Division in 1941, before being promoted to chief-of-staff of the IJA 1st Army in December 1941. He was promoted to lieutenant general in October 1943, and was assigned command of the IJA 55th Infantry Division in Burma. This division was heavily involved in combat against the British Army in the Battle of the Admin Box from 5 February to 23 February 1943. His division was also ordered to invade the Akyab region of Burma from 11 January 1944; however, his offensive was destroyed by British reinforcements and air supremacy and retreated to avoid encirclement. In particular, 19 February 1944, the commander of the 112th regiment broke the radio communications and withdrew his remaining men without order. 112th regiment was by that time down to roughly 400 men from original 3000, and was faced by British forces including \"a hundred\" of artillery pieces, according to survivor`s testimony. Hanaya's men counterattacked along the lower Sittang River in May\u2013June 1945, which allowed part of the IJA 25th Army to escape.\nIn July 1945, Hanaya was appointed chief of staff of the IJA 39th Army, which was based in Bangkok. However, only 5 days later he was promoted to chief of staff of the IJA 18th Area Army. Hanaya had a reputation for brutalizing the officers under his command, and was universally hated, maintaining his position despite of numerous complaints only due direct support from Hideki Tojo. His methods featured extremely foul language, arbitrary beating (he was cited to say \"i beat you because you are easy victim\"), ordering ill soldiers out of hospital, and multiple forced suicides of subordinated officers.\nHe was also one of the first to accept the announcement by Emperor Hirohito ending the war. In the immediate post-war era, Hanaya was active in ultra-rightist organizations (acting independently), and published his memoirs on the Manchurian Incident in 1955. Then ill, customary fundraising among former subordinates failed to attract even a single donations, and his funeral was shunned by community.\n\n\n== References ==\nFuller, Richard (1992).

The 500 km altitude flights, after the first 120 km of active regime, were performing 8\u20139 minutes of observations, with further parachute landing of the payload.\nThe observatories of K-2, K-3 and K-4 series while undergoing ever developing modifications and combinations, included:\nLyman alpha camera for Solar chromospheric imaging, of 500 mm focal length, 70 mm slit;\ncoronal slit Roland spectrograph of wavelength range 500-1300 A and spectral resolution 0.1 A;\nchromospheric spectrograph of 700-1800 A of resolution 0.1 A;\ncamera for coronal imaging at 2000-3000 A and up to 24 Solar radii distance from Solar disk;\ncamera for monochromatic imaging at 304 HeII and 584 HeI lines of 50 mm slit and of focal length 250 mm;\nSolar imaging cameras at wavelengths shorter than 60 A, of focal length 150 mm and angular resolution up to 1 arc minute;\nX-ray spectrograph for Solar corona spectra at 10-150 A, with dispersion 3A/mm.\nThe safe return of the payload enabled its use at several flights. During the launch of October 1, 1965 the most powerful Solar X-ray flare among ever detected by then, was observed. The launch of October 3, 1970 also was notable The very first launch was performed at February 15, 1961, during a Solar eclipse.\nIn the 1970s Gurzadyan's team, then in Garni Space Astronomy Laboratory in Armenia, developed the orbital Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories, installed onboard space station Salyut 1 and Soyuz 13, respectively.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "James Cashman (born June 1965) is an Irish retired hurler who played as a centre-back for the Cork senior team.\nBorn in Blackrock, Cork, Cashman first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Col\u00e1iste Chr\u00edost R\u00ed. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1985 Oireachtas Cup. Cashman subsequently became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals, three Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion.\nAs a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Cashman won one Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a two-time championship medallist with Blackrock.\nCashman's father, Mick Cashman, his uncle, Jimmy Brohan, and his brother, Tom Cashman, all played for Cork.\nThroughout his career Cashman made 29 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1996 championship.\nIn retirement from playing Cashman became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he has been involved in coaching at underage levels with Blackrock.\nCashman is regarded as one of Cork's best players of his era. During his playing days he won two All-Star awards. Cashman was also chosen as one of the 25 best Cork players of the past 25 years in a 2013 poll.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAfter enjoying little championship success in the minor and under-21 grades with Blackrock, Cashman subsequently joined the senior team. In 1985 Blackrock faced Midleton in the championship decider. Cashman, in the company of his brother Tom, Michael Browne, Kilkennyman Frank Cummins, \u00c9amonn O'Donoghue and Finbarr Delaney, gave a masterful display. A 1-14 to 1-8 victory gave Cashman, who also earned the man of the match award, a first championship medal.\nAfter failing to retain the title Blackrock went into a period of decline. After losing the 1998 decider to Imokilly, Cashman lined out in a fourth championship decider the following year. A 3-17 to 0-8 trouncing of University College Cork, with Cashman giving a man of the match display again, gave him a second championship medal.\n\n\n=== Inter-county ===\nCashman first played for Cork as a goalkeeper on the minor team on 16 May 1981 in a 2-6 to 0-6 Munster semi-final defeat by Clare. He was moved to centre-back the following year before being dropped to the substitutes' bench in his final year as a minor in 1983.\nIn 1985 Cashman joined the Cork under-21 team, however, his two-year tenure in this grade ended without success.\nCashman made his senior debut for Cork on 10 November 1985 in a 2-11 to 1-10 Oireachtas final defeat of Galway. He was a regular throughout the subsequent league campaign and was included in Cork's championship team in 1986. Cork made it five-in-a-row in Munster that year as they defeated Clare by 2\u201318 to 3\u201312 to take the provincial title. It was Cashman's first Munster medal. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland final meeting with Galway on 7 September 1986. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against a Cork team in decline, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom\u00e1s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped the Rebels to a 4\u201313 to 2\u201315 victory. It was Cashman's first All-Ireland medal.\nIn 1990 Cork bounced back after a period in decline. He won his second Munster medal that year following a 4-16 to 2-14 defeat of Tipperary. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1990 pitted Cork against Galway for the second time in four years. Galway were once again the red-hot favourites and justified this tag by going seven points ahead in the opening thirty-five minutes thanks to a masterful display by Cashman's opposite number Joe Cooney. Cork fought back with an equally expert display by captain Tom\u00e1s Mulcahy. The game was effectively decided on an incident which occurred midway through the second half when Cork goalkeeper Ger Cunningham blocked a point-blank shot from Martin Naughton with his nose. The umpires gave no 65-metre free, even though he clearly deflected it out wide. Cork went on to win a high-scoring and open game of hurling by 5\u201315 to 2\u201321. As well as winning a second All-Ireland medal Cashman was later presented with a first All-Star.\nCork surrendered their All-Ireland crown to Tipperary in 1991, however, in spite of an early championship exit Cashman finished the year with a second All-Star.\nIn 1992 Cashman claimed a third Munster medal following a 1-22 to 3-11 of Limerick. On 6 September 1992 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. At half-time Cork were two points ahead, however, two second-half goals by John Power and Michael \"Titch\" Phelan supplemented a first-half D. J. Carey penalty which gave Kilkenny a 3-10 to 1-12 victory.\nCashman won a National Hurling League medal in 1993 following a 3-11 to 1-12 defeat of Wexford.\nAfter unsuccessful championship campaigns over the following three years, Cashman retired from inter-county hurling following Cork's exit from the 1996 championship.\n\n\n=== Inter-provincial ===\nCashman was first picked for the Munster inter-provincial team in 1987, however, Munster's campaign ended at the semi-final stage. He made it onto the starting fifteen in 1991, however, Munster fell to an all-Galway Connacht team by 1-13 to 0-12 in the decider.\nIn 1992 Cashman was at centre-back as Munster faced Ulster in the decider. A 3-12 to 1-8 victory gave Cashman a Railway Cup medal.\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Player ===\nBlackrock\nCork Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1985, 1999\nCork\nAll-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1986, 1990\nMunster Senior Hurling Championship (3): 1986, 1990, 1992\nNational Hurling League (1): 1992-93\nOireachtas Tournament (1): 1985\nMunster\nRailway Cup (1): 1992\n\n\n=== Individual ===\nHonours\nAll-Star (2): 1990, 1991\n\n\n== References ==",

Wonder Woman #247 (Sept. 1978) and #289 (March 1982) featured additional versions, and in Wonder Woman vol. 2 #75 (June 1993) the character encountered a version complete with tiara in a dream dimension. In Aquaman #1,000,000 (Nov. 1998), the eponymous hero of the title encounters one of the \"Krakens of Vexjor\", a race of huge tentacled reptilian sea monsters that inhabit Earth's oceans in the 853rd Century.

            "content": "Balgo, previously Balgo Hills and Balgo Mission, is a small community in Western Australia that is linked with both the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert. The community is in the Shire of Halls Creek, off the Tanami Road (formerly known as the Tanami Track). It has a petrol station, supermarket, Catholic Parish, Luurnpa Catholic School (K\u201310), Adult Education Centre, Clinic and Police Station. At the 2006 census, Balgo had a population of 460.\nIt is possible that the name Balgo is related to the Kukatja language word palkurr-palkurr, meaning rice grass, which grows on the hills at Old Mission, a former site of the community. Kukatja is the first language for many people at Balgo. Luurnpa Catholic School has published a comprehensive Kukatja dictionary, based on the work of several linguists. The school includes the Walkala Centre where audio books are written, recorded onto CD or DVD in both Kukatja and English and illustrated.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe community was established following the arrival of German Pallottine Catholic missionaries in the region in 1939. Following the outbreak of World War II, the Australian government designated the missionaries \"enemy aliens\" and their radio transmitter and firearms were confiscated by police. After earlier sites proved to be unsatisfactory, the present site was chosen, in 1942.\nDuring the 1980s, Balgo became famous for its artists' cooperative which was established when some of the original members of the Papunya Tula movement were allowed to leave Papunya. Some of the artists from Balgo include Susie Bootja Bootja Napaltjarri, Topsy Gibson Napaljarri, Eubena Nampitjin, Elizabeth Nyumi, Boxer Milner, Tjumpo Tjapanangka and Helicopter Tjungurrayi.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe community is managed by Wirrimanu Aboriginal Corporation, which was incorporated on 6 September 1984 under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act (1976).\nBalgo falls within the Determined Tjurabalan People (WC95/74) native title claim area.\nThe town plan, Balgo Layout Plan No. 3 was prepared in accordance with State Planning Policy 3.2 and was endorsed by the community and the WAPC in 2005. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWarlayirti Artists and Cultural Centre\nLuurnpa School Website\nBalgo Adult Education Centre Website\nKutjungka Parish Website\nDocuments for Wirrimanu Aboriginal Corporation\nNative Title Claimant application summary",

It is known from two poems in the Book of Taliesin.\nAccording to Taliesin the Anglian king Ulph \"came with violence on his enemies\" and was met in battle and killed by Urien map Cynfarch, King of Rheged (probably Cumbria and/or Galloway), and his son Owain mab Urien, as noted in two separate poems. The Bernician attack would have been faced by spear and javelin armed horsemen, who made up the bulk of the Rhegedian warriors, whilst the Bernicians themselves would have primarily consisted of infantry as was the standard for Anglo-Saxon warriors of the period. Ulph was probably one of the sons of King Ida of Bernicia, most likely Theodulf, which puts the battle at c.574 or c.590, or potentially Frithuwolf, also known as Freothulf or Frithuwald, which would put the Alclud Ford at c.580.\nThe battle was fought at a time when Rheged was at its ascendancy, and the armies under Urien and Owain were the most powerful in the north.\n\n\n== References ==",

The film is loosely based on the crimes of California serial killer Richard Ramirez.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA man knocks on a teenage girl's door, claiming to be in need of directions. When the girl leaves to answer the phone, the man sneaks in, and grabs her when she returns. Physically and verbally assaulting the girl, the man drags her into a bedroom by the neck, and rapes her. The rapist ejaculates and urinates on the teen's face, and asphyxiates her with a bag while yelling that Richard Ramirez is his \"God\". Tracking the killer is obnoxious Channel 5 Action News reporter Roberto Negro, who has been receiving taunting letters from the murderer, most of them containing rants about how he worships Satan.\nThe killer and two accomplices (one of them initially reluctant) attack a pregnant housewife, filming themselves pummeling and raping her at gunpoint. When the trio finish, they shoot the woman and her dog. Roberto reports on the housewife's death, and while the authorities refuse to confirm there is a serial killer on the loose, Roberto is convinced there is.\nSpotting a woman having car trouble, the killer and his partners pull up in their van, force her into the vehicle, and take her to their hideout, the interior of which is covered in Satanic graffiti. The woman is filmed being abused, raped and stabbed, with the killer smearing her blood on himself and the walls of the room. An envelope containing a knife, a gun and another note is sent to Roberto, and the police acquire clues from these items. Another package, this one containing a VHS tape, is dropped off at Roberto's office. The tape is a tribute to the killer, showing two of his fans brutalizing and sexually assaulting a woman. Roberto recognizes one of the copycats as a gas station attendant, who the police arrest.\nIn a newscast, Roberto states that the copycat, his partner and the original murderer's accomplices have been apprehended, but the lead killer is still at large. Elsewhere, two men recognize the serial killer when he walks by them on the street, and chase him, being joined by several others. The killer is cornered in an alleyway, and beat and stabbed to death by the angry mob. Roberto finds the man's body, kicks it twice, and walks away.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJewel De'Nyle as Victim #1\nTaylor St. Claire as Victim #2\nVeronica Cain as Victim #3\nAlexandra Quinn as The Copycat Killer's Victim\nMichael Stefano as The Killer\nMickey G. as Accomplice #1\nBrian Surewood as Accomplice #2\nValentino as The Copycat Killer\nRob Zicari as Roberto Negro\nAngel\nMr. Vegas\nPete Malloy\nWanker Wang\nDr. Jeckyl\nEvil Merchant\nDerek Newblood\nSylveeya\nDoomhammer\nSmiley Johnson\nRawhide Kid\nRod Fontana\nMr. Pete\nX-Man\nJuggs\nTony Tedeschi\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe crew of the television series Frontline stormed off in disgust while visiting the set of the film for their documentary American Porn. Paul Fishbein, president of AVN, referred to Forced Entry and the rest of the Extreme Associates library as \"horrible, unwatchable, disgusting, aberrant movies\".\nThe Village Voice stated the film is \"The most violent porno I've seen. It's both shocking and completely banal\" while Adult FYI wrote \"It's brutal. More than that, it's terribly evil. Convincing. Incredibly well acted and directed\". A score of six out of ten was awarded by Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews, which concluded its review with \"They have every right to make and sell this tape. It is a shame that these very talented people would waste their time on this. Can you imagine the good stuff they could be doing?\" \nForced Entry was described as \"a disturbing piece of hardcore, made by and for some very disturbed people\" by Recarts Movies Erotica, which said that while the acting was good and it succeeded in creating physical and sexual tension, it suffered from cheesy effects and editing, inconsistent camerawork, and poor production values. Adult Industry News decried Forced Entry as a borderline snuff film, writing \"promoting violence and/or making (or trying to make) rape look sexy is very disturbing\" and \"movies like this are more than controversial, they are bad for the adult film business\". Academic Eugenie Brinkema has written extensively on the film, its content and its reception in an article called 'Rough Sex'.\n\n\n== See also ==\nForced Entry, a similar film released in 1973.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nForced Entry on IMDb\nForced Entry at the Internet Adult Film Database",

            "content": "The Reverend Francis Charles Robert Jourdain M.A., F.Z.S., M.B.O.U. (4 March 1865 \u2013 27 February 1940), was a notable British amateur ornithologist and oologist. He was primarily known for his extensive research into the breeding biology of the birds of the Palaearctic region. He also had interests in the food of British birds and their geographical distribution and strongly encouraged detailed and accurate record keeping in local ornithology. He was a founder of the British Oological Association, which changed its name after his death to the Jourdain Society in his memory.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nJourdain was born in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, the eldest son of Rev. F. Jourdain, vicar of Ashbourne-cum-Mapleton. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, and ordained in 1890. Following two curacies in Suffolk he was appointed vicar of Clifton-by-Ashbourne in 1894. In 1914 he was appointed rector of Appleton, near Abingdon-on-Thames, where he stayed until he retired in 1925.\n\n\n== Ornithology ==\nHe did not publish his first ornithological paper until 1899. From 1900 he went on an ornithological expedition abroad almost every year until his death, which resulted in a number of papers on the birds of the countries he visited. While at Appleton he actively encouraged ornithological study at Oxford University, welcoming interested students to his home. In 1922 he founded the Oxford Ornithological Society and was president until his retirement in 1925. This society led in later years to the formation of the British Trust for Ornithology and the Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology. He organized and led the Oxford University Spitsbergen Expedition in 1921.\nJourdain produced several ornithological papers, although many were started but never finished, and authored or contributed to a number of books, notably the sections on Breeding-habits, Distribution Abroad and Food in the Handbook of British Birds (1938\u201341). He was assistant editor of British Birds from 1909 onwards, assistant editor of The Ibis from 1931 onwards and co-editor of The Oologists Record from 1935 onwards. He joined the British Ornithologists' Union in 1899, serving on the committee including as vice-President in 1934, joined the British Ornithologists' Club in 1905, was a member of the British List Committee for many years and was a founding member of the British Oological Association, of which he was president from 1932\u201339. He was also a member of the International Ornithological Committee, an Honorary Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union and an Honorary Member of the ornithological societies of France, Germany, Holland and Hungary.\nHe led the first Oxford University Expedition to Spitzbergen and travelled extensively in Europe and North Africa. He served as President of the Oxford Ornithological Society and was associated with many other ornithological bodies.\nHe retired in 1925, initially to Norfolk and then to Southbourne in Bournemouth two years later. He continued active field ornithology, writing and regularly attending ornithological gatherings right up until his death.\nJourdain died in Southbourne on 27 February 1940.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nIn addition to many ornithological papers, books he authored or coauthored include:\nHartert, Ernst; Jourdain, F.C.R.; Ticehurst, N.F.; Witherby, H.F.

            "content": "In the U.S. state of Texas, U.S. Route 82 is a U.S. Highway that begins on the New Mexico border and heads east through West Texas and Lubbock to the Arkansas border at Texarkana.\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\n\n=== New Mexico\u2013Texas state line to Wichita Falls ===\nUS 82 crosses into Texas from New Mexico at Texas Farm to Market Road 769, turning northeastward toward Plains, where it merges with US 380. US 82 is co-signed with US 380 from Plains to Brownfield, where it joins US 62, and US 380 leaves the route. US 82/62 continues northeastward toward Lubbock.\nIn Lubbock, US 82 and US 62 split, where US 82 is being upgraded to a full access freeway, to be named the Marsha Sharp Freeway, in honor of retired Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball coach Marsha Sharp. On the east side of the city, it once again merges with US 62 (along with State Highway 114) where it continues eastward through Ralls, where US 62 makes a sharp turn to the north and leaves the route. US 82 continues eastward across the level plains of the Llano Estacado to Crosbyton and then dips downward as it crosses the White River of Blanco Canyon, where the Texas Department of Transportation maintains the Silver Falls Rest Area with facilities and hiking trails. After climbing out of Blanco Canyon, US 82 eventually exits the Llano Estacado and enters the rolling plains near Dickens.\nUS 82/SH 114 continues eastward as a co-signed route until Seymour, where it merges with U.S. Highways 183, 277 and 283, with US 183 and 283 leaving the route at Mabelle. US 82/277 continues eastward to Wichita Falls, merging with I-44 and US 287 just south of downtown at Mile marker 0.\n\n\n=== Wichita Falls to Texarkana and Texas\u2013Arkansas state line ===\nUS 82 leaves US 287 at Henrietta and continues east towards the small towns of Nocona, Texas (beginning as a four-lane divided highway), St. Jo, Texas and Muenster, Texas and crossing Interstate 35 in Gainesville at a partial cloverleaf interchange (It has since been converted to a frontage road interchange in 2012.). The highway continues east towards Whitesboro, Texas and Sherman, Texas where it crosses US Highway 75 at a three-level diamond interchange (the portion through Sherman is called the Buck Owens Freeway in honor of the country music star, who was born in Sherman). Prior to the 1990s, the two highways ran concurrently on the route of Texas State Highway 56 before being rerouted northeast of Sherman on its present-day route. The highway continues east to Bells, Texas where US 82 cross US Route 69.\nIn Bonham, Texas, US 82 crosses Texas SH 121 while the route runs parallel with SH 56 until Honey Grove, Texas where SH 56 ends. US 82 enters Paris, Texas at a diamond interchange where it runs concurrent with Texas Loop 286 on the north side of the city as a Business Route runs through the center of the city before rejoining on the east side of Paris. At a diamond interchange on the north side of Paris, US 82/TX Loop 286 meets with US 271 where both highways run concurrent on the northeast side of town before US 82 branches off at another diamond interchange on the east side of Paris. After passing around Clarksville, Texas and other smaller towns the highway is crossed by Interstate 30 east of New Boston, Texas at a partial cloverleaf and continues to run parallel to IH 30 into Arkansas through downtown Texarkana.\n\n\n== Future ==\nThe Marsha Sharp Freeway, named for former Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball coach Marsha Sharp, is currently being built along US 82 in Lubbock, Texas. In 1998, funding was first received. The five-phase project was scheduled to be completed in 2015.\nPhase 2 of the project was scheduled to be completed in December 2008 at a cost of $140 million. It involved construction of the freeway from Salem Avenue to Avenue L and erecting interchanges at 19th Street, Quaker Avenue, Fourth Street, and Avenue Q in Lubbock. Currently construction on the freeway has started from Millwaukee ave to Upland ave and on the intersection of spur 327 and U.S. 62/82. \nTxDOT began upgrading U.S. 82 in Grayson and Fannin County in 2013. The four-lane divided highway upgrade between Sherman and Bonham was completed in 2015. TxDOT plans to continue this upgrade to the Fannin and Lamar County line by 2020. Long term planning calls for U.S. 82 to be a four-lane divided highway system the entire length between Wichita Falls and Texarkana as a potential alternate route through north Texas in order to bypass the overcrowded Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.\nIt is being upgraded to a 4 lane divided highway west of Nocona, and a partial bypass is planned to run south of Gainesville.\n\n\n== Major intersections ==\n\n\n== References ==",

These programs are authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (P.L. 79-396, as amended) and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966; (P.L. 89-642, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) are financed by annual agricultural appropriations laws; and are administered by the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) of USDA.\nChanges to the authorizing statutes generally are made by the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee in the Senate. In the House, the Education and the Workforce Committee deals with most changes to child nutrition program authorizing statutes, although the Agriculture Committee usually is involved when proposed changes concern agricultural interests such as commodity distribution, food restrictions, and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from the Congressional Research Service document \"Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition\" by Jasper Womach.",

The range forms the western boundary of Panamint Valley, and the northwestern boundary of Searles Valley. The Coso Range is located to the west, and the Panamint Range to the east.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Argus Range is one of the westernmost of the Basin and Range Province ranges. The northern end of the range is just south of the Panamint Springs Resort on Highway 190. The range runs south to Argus Peak, just northwest of Searles Lake, near the town of Trona, California. In addition to Argus Peak, the range contains Maturango Peak.\nThe crest of the Argus Range is located within NAWS China Lake and so the peaks of this range are off-limits to the general public. The two peaks that are most alluring to would-be hikers are Argus Peak (6,562 ft or 2,000 m) and Maturango Peak (8,839 ft or 2,694 m) towering to the west of Panamint Valley.\n\n\n== Argus Range Wilderness ==\nThe Argus Range Wilderness, under the administration of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), runs 28 miles (45 km) along the east side of the Argus Range. It extends from the military reservation on the west to the foot of the Argus Range on the east. For most of its length, this wilderness area is no more than two miles (3 km) wide. Several private property holdings are located within this wilderness area including a rather deep cherry-stem at Snow Canyon and a 40-acre (16 ha) parcel known as Onyx Springs between Shepherd and Bendire Canyons. Many land-owners were affected by the creation of the Argus Range Wilderness Area in 1994 .\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArgus Range Wilderness website.
