He starred mostly in action films such as the American Ninja series, The Delta Force (1986), The Exterminator (1980), and Enter the Game of Death (1978). James also portrayed Kung Fu Joe in the 1988 comedy/spoof film I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, and its 1990 television pilot spinoff Hammer, Slammer, & Slade.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSteve James was born and raised in New York City. His father was trumpet player Hubie James. His uncle was James Wall, who played Mr. Baxter on the children's television series Captain Kangaroo. His godfather was Joe Seneca who, among many roles, played Danny Glover's father in Silverado. Joe Seneca was instrumental in Steve becoming interested in action films as he took him to movies on 42nd Street when he was a child. He graduated from Power Memorial Academy in 1970, then attended C.W. Post College as an Arts and Film major. Upon graduating, he became involved in stage work and TV commercials. James started his film career off as a stunt performer for such New York based film productions as The Wiz, The Warriors, and The Wanderers.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nOn December 18, 1993, James died of pancreatic cancer in his home in Burbank, California at age 41.\nHis last roles were in the feature film Bloodfist V: Human Target with Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson and the pilot for the TV series M.A.N.T.I.S.. The pilot first aired on Fox just a few weeks after his death. He was also scheduled to star as Jax Briggs in 1995's Mortal Kombat until his death. Eulogies at Steve's funeral service were delivered by Sidney Poitier (as his widow, Chris, was employed by Mr. Poitier), his father Hubie James, his friend John A. Gallagher and Christine Pan James. His urn resides on the mantle of his home in Burbank, California.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n=== Stunts ===\n\n\n=== Writer ===\nStreet Hunter (1990)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSteve James on IMDb\nSteve James at AllMovie\nSteve James at Find a Grave",

            "content": "Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park is a California State Park of approximately 680 acres (2.8 km2) located on the boundary between Ventura and Los Angeles counties, between the communities of Chatsworth and Simi Valley. Geologically, the park is located where the Simi Hills meet the Santa Susana Mountains. Here in the western part of the Transverse Ranges, the land is dominated by high, narrow ridges and deep canyons covered with an abundant variety of plant life. The park offers panoramic views of the rugged natural landscape as a striking contrast to the developed communities nearby. The park is also rich in archaeological, historical and cultural significance.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park includes a 174-acre (0.70 km2) National Register of Historic Places property consisting of historic features and sites. This includes the Tongva, Chumash, and Tataviam Native American people's trading routes and village sites remains.\nIt also includes portions of the Old Santa Susana Stage Road. The Santa Susana stagecoach road was the main route for mail and travelers between Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California northwest to Simi Valley, Santa Barbara, and the San Francisco Bay Area from 1861 until 1876, when the rail connections began between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area through the Newhall Pass opened. The stage road was declared City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #92 (designated 01/05/1972) and Ventura County Historical Landmark #104 (designated 10/21/1986).\nThe park also includes land that was previously part of the Spahn Ranch, infamous for its connections to Charles Manson, and many decades as a movie ranch.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe State of California acquired portions of the park in 1979 and acquired additional parcels into the late 1990s. The property was formally classified as a State Historic Park in 1998. Many trails and vistas are available in the park. The NPS \"Rim of the Valley\" master plan for a hiking and equestrian trail corridor from the Santa Monica Mountains to the San Gabriel Mountains includes the park's trails and open space as an important link.\n\n\n== Park entrances ==\nThe traditional entrance to Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park on Devonshire Street is closed during ongoing environmental cleanup of an old shooting range within city-owned Chatsworth Park South. The Foundation for the Preservation of the Santa Susana Mountains website suggests the following for \"access to Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park:\nThe main entrance through Chatsworth Park South and alternate entrance on Jeffery Mark Court are closed; however alternate entrances are available.\nFrom Larwin Avenue: The most convenient alternate access location is on Larwin Avenue one block south of Devonshire Street, turn left (south) at the closed park Devonshire entrance onto Larwin Avenue and go one block until you come to a chain link fence on your right. This is very easy to locate because in addition to the fence, an old set of power lines runs directly overhead. Park along the curb and enter the park through the gap in the fence.\nFrom Santa Susana Pass Road in the northwest corner of the park.\nFrom Lilac Lane in the northwest quadrant of the park.\nFrom near the intersection of Lassen, Andora and Valley Circle southwest of the Oakwood Memorial Cemetery entrance.\" \nClosure proposal\nSanta Susana Pass SHP was one of the 48 California state parks proposed for closure in January 2008 by California's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger as part of a deficit reduction program. A reprieve has avoided this so far.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSanta Susana, California\nBurro Flats Painted Cave\nHistory of the San Fernando Valley\nOld Santa Susana Stage Road\nRocky Peak\nSanta Susana Mountains\nSanta Susana Pass\nSimi Hills\nSanta Susana Mountains topics list\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBevill, Arthur D.

Located in the central Negev desert close to the Egyptian border, around three kilometres from Kmehin, it falls under the jurisdiction of Ramat HaNegev Regional Council. The moshav is located in a nature reserve at the location of an ancient well at the confluence of Nahal Lavan and Nahal Nitzana. In 2016 it had a population of 157.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 2001 a gar'in group from Bnei HaMoshavim (associated with HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed and the Moshavim Movement) began to develop in preparation for founding a new moshav. The gar'in group was established in 2002, and began organising themselves in Kmehin, before establishing Be'er Milka in 2006. The moshav is named after biblical Milka, the grandmother of Rebekah, the wife of Isaac (Genesis 24:47).\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Robert Clark (born March 14, 1987) is an American-Canadian actor. After building up years of experience in singing, stage and limited television work in the 1990s, he has gone on to receive critical and public recognition for his roles in various small screen productions, most notably The Zack Files and Strange Days at Blake Holsey High.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nClark was born Chicago, Illinois, and is the younger brother of Degrassi: The Next Generation star Daniel Clark. In 1988 his mother, Suzanne, relocated with her two sons to Boca Raton, Florida. When she re-married in 1991, the entire family moved near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Clark joined the Belfountain Singers (based in Caledon, Ontario), and performed at various live concerts, both with the group and solo. The Singers performed at the 1997 Winter Special Olympics, and they also sang on the national talk show Open Mike with Mike Bullard. Clark (with his brother, Daniel) attended the Randolph School for the Performing Arts, and successfully completed the school's Kids Triple-Threat Musical Theatre Program.\nClark's very first professional acting role was opposite hockey player Wayne Gretzky in a television commercial for Honeycomb Cereal. Under his mother's guidance, he used his previous singing experience in auditions for stage productions such as Lyla Rules.Ragtime (1998) and Beauty and the Beast, though he lost the role in the latter to his brother. He subsequently managed to clinch a recurring role in the television show I Was a Sixth Grade Alien (starring his brother), and made several guest appearances in programs such as Eerie, Indiana: The Other Dimension (also starring his brother), Real Kids, Real Adventures, and Twice in a Lifetime.\nClark's acting career was not limited to the small screen, however; in Superstar (1999), Clark was Eric Slater (Harland Williams) as a child. He later won small parts in a few television movies: Switching Goals (1999) with Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, as a Goth in The Ride (2000), and in All-American Girl: The Mary Kay Letourneau Story (2000), as the son of real-life convicted child rapist Mary Kay Letourneau.\nIn Rated X (2000), a fact-based film directed by and starring Emilio Estevez, Clark played the younger version of Charlie Sheen's character; a boy physically abused by his father who would grow up to become an adult film director. Following this, Clark had a more prominent role as a street windscreen wiper who donates his life savings of $4.30 to a murder investigation in the A&E Network's original film The Golden Spiders: A Nero Wolfe Mystery, the pilot for the A&E series A Nero Wolfe Mystery. Variety's Steve Oxman spoke highly of the production, calling the cast \"a stellar ensemble\" and noting that \"the performances are more than the sum of their parts\".\nHis first lead role came in the science fiction television show The Zack Files (2000), which its creators described as \"an X-Files for kids\". The show lasted just two seasons, but for his efforts Clark won a Young Artist Award for Leading Young Actor in a Drama Series, and producer John Delmage said that Clark and his co-stars were chosen for their acting ability and had the potential to maintain careers in the profession as adults.\nThe filming schedule for The Zack Files was tight, but Clark found time to participate in other projects. He played the son of a sex addict (Harry Hamlin) in Sex, Lies & Obsession (2001), and also acted opposite John Corbett in the Christmas film Prancer Returns (2001), which went direct-to-video but was praised by critic Scott Weinberg, and earned Clark another Young Artist Award.\nShortly after the cancellation of The Zack Files, Clark was cast in a similar television series, Strange Days at Blake Holsey High, which was first broadcast in the autumn of 2002. Clark's acting performance was well-received; in addition to another Young Artist nomination, Family Screen Scene called the show as a whole \"well written and acted. The looks and mannerisms of the teens fit their characters, adding realism to their roles\". While Strange Days was on the air, Clark could be seen in the Sci-Fi Channel's Deathlands (2003), as the young son of a deceased future king who narrowly escapes death at the hands of his power-hungry brother.\nIn an April 2005 episode of Veronica Mars, Clark played an openly gay teenager recruited by the title character (Kristen Bell) to publicly humiliate the prejudiced ex-boyfriend (Jeff D'Agostino) of one of her friends (Natalia Baron). Reviewing the episode, John Ramos of the website Television Without Pity commented positively on Clark's appearance, making an earnest request to \"give the gay kid more screen time\". Clark also had a supporting role as one of the ten children of a 1950s housewife (Julianne Moore) in the film drama The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio, released to theatres in late 2005.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Robert Clark\".

            "content": "Council Bluffs is a city in and the county seat of Pottawattamie County, Iowa, United States. The city is the most populous in Southwest Iowa, and a principal city in the Omaha\u2013Council Bluffs metropolitan area. It is located on the east bank of the Missouri River, across from Omaha, Nebraska. Council Bluffs was known, until at least 1853, as Kanesville. It was the historic starting point of the Mormon Trail. Kanesville is also the northernmost anchor town of the other emigrant trails, since there was a steam powered boat to ferry their wagons, and cattle, across the Missouri River.\nCouncil Bluffs' population was 62,230 at the 2010 census. Along with neighboring Omaha to the west, Council Bluffs was part of the 60th-largest metropolitan area in the United States in 2010, which had an estimated population of 865,350 residing in the eight counties of the Omaha\u2013Council Bluffs metropolitan area.\nCouncil Bluffs is more than a decade older than Omaha. The latter, founded in 1854 by Council Bluffs businessmen and speculators following the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, has grown to be a significantly larger city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1804\u20131843 \u2013 Pottawatomi Reservation Caldwell's Camp ===\nThe first Council Bluff name (singular) was actually on the Nebraska side of the river at Fort Atkinson (Nebraska) about 20 miles northwest of the current Council Bluffs. It was named by Lewis and Clark for a bluff where they met with the Otoe tribe on August 2, 1804.\nThe Iowa side became an Indian Reservation for members of the Council of Three Fires of Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi who were forced to vacate the Chicago area in the Treaty of Chicago in 1833/1835 clearing the way for that city to incorporate.\nThe largest contingent of Native Americans moving to the area were the Pottawatomi who were led by Sauganash (\"one who speaks English\") whose father was a British loyalist William Caldwell who founded Canadian communities on the South side of the Detroit River (the North side is Detroit in the U.S.) and whose mother was a Native American. The band of about 1,000 to 2,000 seeking to avoid confrontation with the Sioux who were natives of the Council Bluffs area initially settled further south in Indian Territory on the east side of the Missouri River between Leavenworth, Kansas and St. Joseph, Missouri.\nWhen this area was bought from Ioway, Sac and Fox tribes in the Platte Purchase to become part of Missouri in 1837, Sauganash and the Pottawatomi were forced to move to their official reservation in Council Bluffs. Sauganash's English name was Billy Caldwell and the village came to be called Caldwell's Camp. The group was sometimes called the Bluff Indians. The U.S. Dragoons built a small fort nearby.\nIn 1838\u201339, the missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet founded St. Joseph's Mission to minister to the Potawatomi. De Smet was appalled by the violence and brutality caused by the whiskey trade, and tried to protect the tribe from unscrupulous traders. However, he had little success in persuading tribal members to convert to Christianity and resorted to secret baptisms of Indian children.\nDuring this time, De Smet contributed to Joseph Nicollet\u2019s work in mapping the upper midwest. De Smet produced the first European-recorded, detailed map of the Council Bluffs area; it detailed the Missouri River valley system, from below the Platte River to the Big Sioux River.\n\nDe Smet wrote an early description of the Potawatomi settlement, which captures his bias:\n\n\"Imagine a great number of cabins and tents, made of the bark of trees, buffalo skins, coarse cloth, rushes and sods, all of a mournful and funeral aspect, of all sizes and shapes, some supported by one pole, others having six, and with the covering stretched in all the different styles imaginable, and all scattered here and there in the greatest confusion, and you will have an Indian village.\"\n\nAs more native Americans were pushed into the Council Bluffs area by pressure of European-American settlement to the east, inter-tribal conflict increased, fueled by the illegal whiskey trade. The US Army built Fort Croghan in 1842, to keep order and try to control liquor traffic on the Missouri River. However that fort was destroyed in a flood the same year.\nBy 1846 the Pottawatomi were forced to move again to a new reservation at Osawatomie, Kansas.\n\n\n=== 1844\u20131851 \u2013 Mormon Community of Kanesville ===\nIn 1844, the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party crossed the Missouri River here, on their way to blaze a new path into California across the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Beginning in 1846, there was a large influx of Latter-day Saints into the area, although in the winter of 1847\u20131848 most Latter-day Saints crossed to the Nebraska side of the Missouri River. Initially, the area was called \"Miller's Hollow\", after Henry W. Miller, who would be the first member of the Iowa State Legislature from the area. Miller also was the foreman for the construction of the Kanesville Tabernacle.\nBy 1848, the town had become known as Kanesville, named for benefactor Thomas L. Kane, who had helped negotiate in Washington, DC federal permission for the Mormons to use Indian land along the Missouri for their winter encampment of 1846\u201347. Built at or next to Caldwell's Camp, Kanesville became the main outfitting point for the Mormon Exodus to Utah, and it is the recognized head end of the Mormon Trail.\nEdwin Carter, who would become a noted naturalist in Colorado, worked here from 1848\u20131859 in a dry goods store. He helped supply Mormon wagon trains.\nSettlers departing west from Kanesville, into the sparsely settled, unorganized parts of the Territory of Missouri to the Oregon Country and the newly conquered California Territory, through the (eventual) Nebraska Territory, traveled by wagon trains along the much-storied Oregon, Mormon, or California Trails into the newly expanded United States western lands.\nAfter the first large organized wagon trains left Missouri in 1841, the annual migration waves began in earnest by spring of 1843. They built up, thereafter, with the opening of the Mormon Trail (1846) until peaking in the later 1860s, when news of railroad's progress had a braking effect.\nBy the 1860s, virtually all migration wagon trains were passing near the renamed town. The wagon train trails became less important with the advent of the first complete transcontinental railway in 1869, but while trail use diminished after that, their use continued on at lesser rates until late in the nineteenth century.\nThe Mormon Battalion began their march from Kanesville to California during the Mexican\u2013American War. This was where plural marriage first began to be openly practiced. Orson Hyde began publishing The Frontier Guardian newspaper, and Brigham Young was sustained as the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church). The community was transformed by the California Gold Rush, and the majority of Mormons left for Utah by 1852.\n\n\n=== 1852\u20131900 Council Bluffs and Beginning of Railroad Era ===\nIn 1852, the town was renamed Council Bluffs. It continued as a major outfitting point on the Missouri River for the Emigrant Trail and Pike's Peak Gold Rush, and entertained a lively steamboat trade.\nIn 1863 an anonymous soldier on his way to fight the Dakota Uprising passed through Council Bluffs and described a hardscrabble town:\n\nAt Council Bluffs our arrival was greeted by a few rounds from the old six pounder, while the streets were lined with a curiosity-seeking class of humanity, among which could easily be traced the physiognomy of bipeds of almost every clime\u2014all here to make money. The cute Yankee whittling out wooden hams to sell to Pikes' Peak emigrants, the Chatham Street peddler, with his stock of \"oht clo's,\" ready to swear that he had them manufactured expressly for his western trade; the mock auctioneer, the jeweler with his pinchback jewelry of all kinds; horse and mule jockeys, gamblers, thieves, assassin\u2014and the mischief knows what not, rather than what is\u2014all congregated in this little 7\u00d79 city, stuck in a great ravine, 3 miles from the Missouri River. When you understand that this is the great entrepot for emigration across the Plains, you will readily comprehend that this is a good point at which to \"take stranger in,\" and it is done almost every day. Our stay at Council Bluffs was very short (two days) and I think no one was sorry to leave it.\n\nCouncil Bluffs (rather than Omaha) was designated by Abraham Lincoln as the official starting point of the transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869. The official \"Mile 0\" start is at 21st Street and 9th Avenue which is now marked by a gold spike that was used for the promotion of the movie Union Pacific Council Bluffs physical connection to the Transcontinental Railroad was delayed until 1872 when the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge opened (railroad cars had to be ferried across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs to Omaha in the early days of the Transcontinental).\nThe Chicago and North Western Railway arrived 1867. Other railroads operating in the city came to include the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, Chicago Great Western Railway, Wabash Railroad, Illinois Central Railroad, Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad.\n\n\n=== 1900\u2013present ===\n\nIn 1926, the portion of Council Bluffs west of the Missouri River seceded to form Carter Lake, Iowa. Carter Lake had been cut off by a change in the course of the Missouri River.\nBy the 1930s, Council Bluffs had grown into the country's fifth largest rail center. The railroads helped the city become a center for grain storage, and massive grain elevators continue to mark the city's skyline. Other industries in the city included Blue Star Foods, Dwarfies Cereal, Frito-Lay, Georgie Porgie Cereal, Giant Manufacturing, Kimball Elevators, Mona Motor Oil, Monarch, Reliance Batteries, Woodward's Candy, and World Radio. During the 1940s, Meyer Lansky operated a greyhound racing track in Council Bluffs.\nRestructuring of the railroad industry caused the loss of many jobs after the mid-20th century, as did the restructuring of heavy industry. Many jobs moved offshore. By the late 20th century the city and region were suffering economic stagnation and a declining population, as they struggled to develop a new economy. Downtown urban renewal was undertaken to create a new future while emphasizing the strengths of heritage.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCouncil Bluffs is located at 41\u00b015\u203213\u2033N 95\u00b051\u203245\u2033W (41.253698, \u221295.862388).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 43.62 square miles (112.98 km2), of which 40.97 square miles (106.11 km2) is land and 2.65 square miles (6.86 km2) is water.\nCouncil Bluffs covers a unique topographic region originally composed of prairie and savanna in the Loess Hills with extensive wetlands and deciduous forest along the Missouri River. Excellent vistas can be had from KOIL Point at Fairmont Park, the Lincoln Monument, Kirn Park, and the Lewis and Clark Monument. Lake Manawa State Park is located at the southern edge of the city.\nFor the 1820s era United States Army outpost, see Fort Atkinson (Nebraska).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 62,230 people, 24,793 households, and 15,528 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,518.9 inhabitants per square mile (586.5/km2). There were 26,594 housing units at an average density of 649.1 per square mile (250.6/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 90.9% White, 1.9% African American, 0.6% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 3.6% from other races, and 2.4% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 8.5% of the population.\nThere were 24,793 households of which 31.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.4% were married couples living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, 6.2% had a male householder with no wife present, and 37.4% were non-families. 30.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 11.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.43 and the average family size was 3.01.\nThe median age in the city was 35.9 years. 24.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 10.8% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 26.1% were from 25 to 44; 25.6% were from 45 to 64; and 13.5% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.7% male and 51.3% female.\n\n\n=== 2000 census ===\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 58,268 people, 22,889 households, and 15,083 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,558.7 people per square mile (601.9/km\u00b2). There were 24,340 housing units at an average density of 651.1 per square mile (251.4/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 94.76% White, 1.05% Black or African American, 0.45% Native American, 0.59% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.81% from other races, and 1.31% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.45% of the population.\nThere were 22,889 households out of which 31.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.7% were married couples living together, 14.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.1% were non-families. 27.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.03.\nAge spread: 26.0% under the age of 18, 10.3% from 18 to 24, 29.7% from 25 to 44, 20.8% from 45 to 64, and 13.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 93.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.7 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $36,221, and the median income for a family was $42,715. Males had a median income of $30,828 versus $23,476 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,143. About 8.2% of families and 10.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.0% of those under age 18 and 6.9% of those age 65 or over.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nDowntown Council Bluffs historically covered the area along West Broadway and adjacent streets from Old Town west to the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company Railroad passenger depot at 11th Street. Downtown developed as the economic rival of Old Town after the 1853 opening of the Pacific House Hotel by Samuel S. Bayliss through the 1867 completion of the Chicago and Northwestern. In 1899, the Illinois Central passenger depot opened at 12th St. and West Broadway.\n\nThe area declined as the city's primary retail center after the 1955 completion of the Broadway Viaduct, 1970s urban renewal, and the 1984 opening of the Kanesville Boulevard U.S. Route 6 bypass. Remaining buildings of note include the 1959 Council Bluffs Post Office and Federal Building at 6th Street, the 1986 \"Red\" Nelson Building, the 501 Main Building, the substantially altered 1909 City National Bank Building, and the 1968 First Federal Building. The 1947 State Savings Bank Building at 509 West Broadway and the seven-story 1924 Bennett Building at 405 West Broadway are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 100 Block of West Broadway is a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the 1892 Broadway United Methodist Church at West Broadway and 1st St. remains a prominent community landmark.\nOld Town Council Bluffs was adjudged by Judge Frank Street in the 1850s as the area between West Broadway and Glen Avenue and East Broadway and Frank Street from Harmony Street south to Pierce Street. Today this area encompasses Billy Caldwell\u2018s settlement of Potawatomi on Indian Creek during the 1830s and Kanesville established by the Mormons as Miller's Hollow in 1848. Kanesville was the home of Mormon leaders Orson Hyde, George A. Smith, and Ezra T. Benson and served as a major outfitting point on the Mormon Trail during the California Gold Rush. The reconstructed Kanesville Tabernacle in the 300 block of East Broadway is operated as a museum by the LDS Church.\n\nThe West End is a geographically large area on the flood plain east of the Missouri River and downtown Omaha, Nebraska, west of 10th St. and the Broadway Viaduct, and north of 9th Ave. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards. These neighborhoods of long, tree-shaded avenues are divided by the commercial corridor of West Broadway (U.S. Route 6), once part of the Lincoln Highway. This stretch of West Broadway has traditionally had several drive-in fast food restaurants and automobile dealerships with several grain elevators adjacent along 1st Avenue. West Broadway ends at the Interstate 480 bridge to downtown Omaha. Iowa Highway 192 follows North 16th St. from West Broadway to Interstate 29. Neighborhood landmarks include the 1890s Illinois Central Railroad Missouri River bridge, Stan Bahnsen Park, the Golden Spike monument, the Narrows River Park, Big Lake Park, the site of Dodge Park Playland, the Dodge Christian Church (built with the N.P. Dodge Memorial funds) and many examples of late 19th and early 20th century residential architecture. The West End was used as a location by film director Alexander Payne in the movies Citizen Ruth and About Schmidt.\nCasino Row is located on and near the Missouri River south of West Broadway and Interstate 480, west of South 35th St. and Interstate 29, and north of Interstate 80 along 23rd Avenue west of South 24th St. The opening of the Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in 1986, now the Horseshoe Council Bluffs, was followed in the mid-1990s by riverboat casinos operated by Ameristar and Harvey's Casino Hotel (now Harrah's Council Bluffs). New development in this previously industrial area has included the Mid-America Center, several restaurants and hotels, an AMC Theatres with an IMAX, and a Bass Pro Shops. The appearance of legalized gambling in Council Bluffs became a major issue in neighboring Omaha where Mayor Hal Daub had declared Iowa an \"XXX state\" in 1995 as horse-racing came to an end at Ak-Sar-Ben.\nTwin City is located south of where Interstate 29 splits from Interstate 80, east of South Omaha, Nebraska, west of Indian Creek, and north of the South Omaha Bridge Road (U.S. Route 275 and Iowa Highway 92). This neighborhood developed mostly during the 1960s for workers in nearby Omaha factories and at Offutt Air Force Base. The Interstate 80 Exit at 1-B at South 24th Street includes two large truck stops, a Sapp Brothers and a Pilot Travel Centers, along with several motels, the Western Historic Trails Center, the Bluffs Acres manufactured home development, and The Marketplace shopping area with J.C. Penney as its primary tenant. The Willows on the South Omaha Bridge Road is an example of mid-20th century roadside motel architecture and Bart's Motel further east at South 24th St featured prominent neon signage, was used as a location in the motion picture The Indian Runner, and has since been demolished.\nManawa is the portion of Council Bluffs from the combined Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the city limits between Mosquito and Indian Creeks. The area was developed as a trolley park by the Omaha and Council Bluffs Streetcar Company after the former channel of the Missouri River was \"cut-off\" during an 1881 flood to become modern Lake Manawa State Park. Later development followed the establishment of U.S. Route 275 and the completion of Interstate 80 with additional growth during the 1990s. A variety of fast food restaurants, motels, big-box stores, a TravelCenters of America truck stop, automobile dealerships, and other businesses are located between Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 south to the state park. The Lake Manawa Inn hosts early examples of roadside cabin architecture. In February and March, bald eagles & red-tailed hawks can frequently be seen at Lake Manawa, particularly along the southwest shore.\n\nThe South End is bordered by 12th Avenue on the north, South 16th St. and the Union Pacific Transfer railyards on the west, Interstate 80 and Interstate 29 on the south, and the South Expressway (Iowa Highway 192) on the east. This neighborhood developed during the late 19th century with the railroads, especially the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In the early 20th century much of the area was dubbed \"Dane Town\" or \"Little Copenhagen\" for the large number of Danish immigrants with several Croatian and Mexican families closer to the Union Pacific railyards at \"Little Vienna\". Neighborhood landmarks include Peterson Park, Longfellow School, and the 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific passenger depot, now the RailsWest Railroad Museum.\n\nThe Oakland-Fairview neighborhood developed during the 1890s and features a wealth of 19th-century architecture, including the Judge Finley Burke mansion at 510 Oakland built in 1893 out of Minnesota granite. The neighborhood is also home to the Lincoln Monument. Located at the western end of Lafayette Avenue, the monument was erected in 1911 by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution that, according to folklore, commemorates the spot where Abraham Lincoln decided on the location of the transcontinental railroad in 1859. The monument offers expansive views across the West End in the Missouri River Valley to Omaha, Nebraska. Nearby is the entrance to Fairview Cemetery, situated on the north side of Lafayette Avenue, which predates the establishment of the present city and includes the Kinsman Monument and the burial place of many early settlers, including Amelia Bloomer. At the east end of Lafayette Avenue where it intersects with North Second Street stands the Ruth Anne Dodge Memorial, the \"Black Angel\" designed by Daniel Chester French, although the wife of Grenville Dodge is actually buried elsewhere in Council Bluffs.\nMadison Avenue is the area of Council Bluffs adjacent to Exit 5 of Interstate 80 along Madison and Bennett avenues, Valley View Drive, and the area between Iowa Highway 92 north to McPherson Avenue. Mosquito Creek flows through this area which was originally notable for the Potawatomi gristmill and now includes the usual roadside gas stations, fast food restaurants, motels, and the tracks of the Iowa Interstate Railroad. Plans for a shopping mall here first appeared in 1972 and construction finally began on the Mall of the Bluffs in 1985. A Sears, Old Navy, and Barnes & Noble later opened at the mall which is owned by General Growth Properties with adjacent commercial development by Hy-Vee and No Frills Supermarkets. Residential growth east of the railroad tracks towards State Orchard Road and the Council Bluffs Municipal Airport and north to U.S. Route 6 has included developments outside the Council Bluffs city limits. Original anchor stores J.C. Penney and Target both relocated from the Mall of the Bluffs in 2008.\nThe Huntington Avenue neighborhood consists of early 20th century Craftsman homes that wind along the top of the Loess Hills passed the 1925 studio of radio station KOIL, now apartments.\nThe historic Council Bluffs' Red-light district was formed during the late 19th century, when at least 10 separate brothels were located on Pierce Street east of Park Avenue with another three brothels down the block on the south side of West Broadway east of Park. One 1890 newspaper article referenced in Lt. RL Miller's \"Selected History of the Council Bluffs Police\" noted the \"places of vice and corruption on Pierce\" and Stella Long's above the Ogden House along with the \"terrible den at the corner of Market and Vine\" and Belle Clover's bagnio at 8th St. and West Broadway.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe liberalization of Iowa gambling laws was followed by the opening of The Bluffs Run Greyhound Park in 1986. By 2005, Council Bluffs was the 19th largest casino market in the United States, with revenue equaling nearly $434 million. Casinos include Ameristar Casino Hotel Council Bluffs, Harrah's Council Bluffs, and the Horseshoe Council Bluffs.\nCouncil Bluffs industry includes \"frozen foods, robotics, dairy products, plastics, railroading, electrical products, and pork and beef packaging\" per the city's website. American Games (a manufacturer of lottery gaming products), Barton Solvents, Con-Agra, Grundorf, Katelman Foundry, Omaha Standard Palfinger (a truck body manufacturer established 1926), Red Giant Oil, and Tyson Foods have manufacturing plants in the city.\nGriffin Pipe Products, established in 1921, closed its plant employing about 250 people in March 2014, when it was bought by U.S. Pipe and Foundry, based in Birmingham, Alabama. Griffin Wheels, a part of American Steel Foundries, was one of the largest US manufacturers of iron railroad-car wheels until it switched to pipes in the 1960s.\nMid-American Energy built a new coal-fired plant in 2007; the billion dollar investment was the single largest private investment in Iowa\u2019s history up until then.\nIn 2007, Google began construction of a server farm on the former site of the Council Bluffs Drive-in theater, on Veterans Memorial Highway. This first phase, completed in 2009, was to create \"200 high quality jobs\". The second Google campus, on Bunge Avenue, had an open house in October 2013, employing 50 people who are \"installing and upgrading Google servers and providing maintenance on equipment\". In March 2014, a third phase, the Southlands expansion, was announced, creating 35 additional jobs and bringing Google's investment up to $1.5 billion, the largest private investment in Iowa\u2019s history to date. The state increased its tax abatement of sales and use tax for Google from $9.6 million to $16.8 million. As of July 2014 Google stated it created 130 jobs  and as of June 2016 \"over 300 jobs\" on site.,\n\n\n== Environmental problems ==\nIn 2010, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources found that air in central Council Bluffs measured above the national air quality standard for lead, most likely due to lead emissions in this area by Griffin Pipe Products Company. In 2011, EPA found numerous violations of the Clean Water Act, because the plant's contaminated stormwater commingled with treated process wastewater and was pumped out to the storm sewer, which discharged into the Missouri River.\n\n\n== Arts and culture ==\nCouncil Bluffs is the location of the Pottawattamie County \"Squirrel Cage\" Jail, in use from 1885 until 1969, which is one of three remaining examples of a Rotary Jail. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it was built as a rotary jail with pie-shaped cells on a turntable somewhat based on Jeremy Bentham's panopticon. To access individual cells, the jailer turned a crank to rotate the cylinder until the desired cell lined up with a fixed opening on each floor. According to the Historical Society of Pottawattamie County, the Squirrel Cage Jail is the only three-story rotary jail constructed. Although the rotary mechanism was disabled in 1960, the building remained the county jail for another nine years. Similar, smaller examples of the concept can be seen in Crawfordsville, Indiana and Gallatin, Missouri.\n\nThe city's strong ties to the railroad industry are commemorated by three local museums. The Union Pacific Museum is located in the former Council Bluffs Free Public Library (a Carnegie library), at Pearl Street and Willow Avenue; the Grenville Dodge Home is on Third Street; and the RailsWest Railroad Museum is at South Main Street and Sixteenth Avenue. RailsWest is housed in an 1899 Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad passenger depot later shared with the Milwaukee Road, which was used by the Rocky Mountain Rocket, the Arrow, and the Midwest Hiawatha. RailsWest features an outdoor display of historic train cars, including a Railway Post Office car, two steam locomotives, two cabooses, a Burlington Lounge car, and a 1953 switcher produced by the Plymouth Locomotive Works.\nThe Iowa West Foundation, the charitable wing of the local gambling industry, funded a public art planning process for Council Bluffs in 2004 that emphasized a 2015 goal for the city to become \"a prosperous urban area known for its cultural enlightenment and public art collection.\"\nTo this end the city renovated Bayliss Park in downtown, which was re-dedicated in early 2007 with a new fountain dubbed Wellspring. Its performance pavilion, known as Oculus, was designed by sculptor Brower Hatcher. This was the first installation of the Iowa West Public Art, a foundation established during the Public Art Master Planning process. The Iowa West Foundation then established IWPA along with public art website. In 2008 a 50-foot (15 m)-tall Molecule Man sculpture by Jonathan Borofsky was installed at the Mid-America Center; nearby sculptures were designed by William King and Jun Kaneko. Albert Paley designed elements of the nearby South 24th Street bridge at Exit 1B of the combined Interstate 29 and Interstate 80 at Council Bluffs and Ed Carpenter designed Gateway for the West Broadway viaduct. Artist Dan Corson and the Big Mo by Mark di Suvero are featured at Tom Hanfan's River's Edge Park along the banks of the Missouri River.\nCouncil Bluffs is also home to the Chanticleer Community Theater, TVI Filtration Corporation (a major supplier of discount automotive products), and Hamilton College (Iowa) which is now part of Kaplan University \u2013 Council Bluffs.\nThe black squirrel is the city's mascot. John James Audubon reported the squirrels in 1843, along the Missouri River at Council Bluffs.\nFor one week in late July/early August, the annual Pottawattamie County Fair is held at Westfair grounds. There are carnival rides, concerts, gun shows, tractor races, and a queen contest.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nThe Iowa Blackhawks (later known as the Council Bluffs Express) of the American Professional Football League played at the Mid-America Center from 2004 until 2012. The Mid-America Center was also home to the Omaha Lancers from 2002 until 2008.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPublic education in the city of Council Bluffs is provided by two school districts: Council Bluffs Community School District and Lewis Central Community School District. Most of the city is located within the Council Bluffs Community School District, which operates of public schools, the following: 14 elementary schools, three middle schools, three high schools (Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson), Tucker Center career center, and Kanesville alternative high school. As of the 2008\u20132009 school year, district had a total enrollment of 9,246. The Lewis Central Community School District (one high school, one middles school, and two elementary schools) serves the southern portion of Council Bluffs and enrolled 3,047 students as of the 2008\u20132009 school year.\nThere are several private schools in Council Bluffs, including Community Christian School, Heartland Christian School, Liberty Christian School, Saint Albert Catholic Schools, and Trinity Lutheran Interparish School.\nThe Iowa School for the Deaf moved to the south edge of Council Bluffs in 1870 along what is now Iowa Highway 92. It is open to all students in both Iowa and Nebraska who are younger than 21 and whose hearing loss places them at a disadvantage in the public schools.\nIowa Western Community College is located on the eastern edge of Council Bluffs near the intersection of Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 6 and is the home of the radio station KIWR. Buena Vista University also has a location in Council Bluffs and partners with Iowa Western Community College to offer bachelor's degree completion programs to IWCC graduates.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe city is well served by Interstate 80, Interstate 29, U.S. Route 6, and the Loess Hills National Scenic Byway.

            "content": "The aim of Free Prior Informed consent (FPIC), is to establish bottom up participation and consultation of an Indigenous Population prior to the beginning of a development on ancestral land or using resources within the Indigenous Population's territory. Indigenous people (IP) have a special connection to their land and resources, they inhabit 20% of the earth's surface, these areas are environmentally rich in both renewable and non-renewable resources. The collective ownership style of most Indigenous Peoples conflicts with the modern global market and its continuous need for resources and land. To protect Indigenous peoples rights, international human rights law has created process and standards to safeguard their way of life and to encourage participation in the decision making process. One of these methods is the process of FPIC. There is criticism that many international conventions and treaties only require consultation and not consent, which is a much higher threshold. Without the requirement for consent Indigenous People are not able to veto government projects and developments in their area which directly affects their lives and cultures. FPIC allows Indigenous Peoples to have the right to self-determination and self-governance in national and local government decision making process over projects that concern their lives and resources.\nExamples include natural resource management, economic development, uses of traditional knowledge, genetic resources, health care, and education.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\n\n\n=== Definition ===\nThe United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) [1] has defined the concept of Free Prior Informed Consent as the following:\nFirstly Free \u2018 simply means that there is no manipulation or coercion of the Indigenous People and that the process is self-directed by those effected by the project.\nSecondly \u2018Prior\u2019 implies that consent is sought sufficiently in advance of any activates being either commenced or authorised, and time for the consultation process to occur must be guaranteed by the relative agents.\n'Informed' suggests that the relevant Indigenous people receive satisfactory information on the key points of the project such as the nature, size, pace, reversibility, the scope of the project, the reason for it, and its duration. This is the more difficult term of the four, as different groups may find certain information more relevant. The Indigenous People should also have access to the primary reports on the economic, environmental cultural impact that the project will have. The language used must be able to be understood by the IPs.\nFinally 'consent' means a process in which participation and consultation are the central pillars.\n\n\n=== Application ===\nThe UNPFII requires that Indigenous People should be consulted in a way which is appropriate for their customs. This means that not every member will have to agree. This has been criticised by some [women's rights] groups. The Indigenous People will determine who is to be consulted and must effectively communicate this with the Government and Developers. It is the duty of the state to make sure that FPIC has been carried out, if it has not then it is their issue to redress, not the company or the people wishing to carry out the project. The International Labour Organization [2] requires that consultation takes place in a climate of mutual trust and circumstances are considered appropriate if they create favourable conditions for reaching agreement and consent. In a pilot study by the UN-Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation UN-REDD [3] of FPIC application in Vietnam the following steps were required;\n\n(1) preparation, (2) Consultation with local officials (3) Recruitment of Local Facilitators (4) Training of the local facilitators, (5) awareness raising (6) Village Meeting (7) recording the decision (8) Reporting to UN-REDD Vietnam  (9) Verification and evaluation. The majority of issues with this policy was the recruitment of the Local Facilitators, while they were able to discuss the process in a language that Indigenous Peoples understood there was mistrust towards them and a fear that they had been bribed.\n\n\n== International development ==\nThe principle of FPIC within international development is most clearly stated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Article 10 states:\n\n\"Indigenous peoples shall not be forcibly removed from their lands or territories. No relocation shall take place without the free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return. \"\n\nArticles 11, 19, 28, and 29 of the declaration also explicitly use the term. It is further established in international conventions, notably the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. Countries including Peru, Australia, and the Philippines have included FPIC in their national law.\n\n\n== International law ==\nThe role of indigenous peoples' FPIC in decisions about infrastructure or extractive industries developed on their ancestral domain is an issue within international law. Projects lacking FPIC are called development aggression by indigenous peoples. The issue of indigenous peoples' lack of access to accountability and grievance mechanisms to address human rights violations has been formally raised with the United Nations Human Rights Council. Asian Indigenous peoples have urged the UN to address this before the economic integration of ASEAN in 2015, given the human rights records of member states such as Myanmar and Laos, which are among the world's most repressive societies.\n\n\n=== International Labour Organization ===\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) [] has been working with indigenous people since the 1920s, it currently has 187 member states, including New Zealand. ILO Convention 169 (the Convention) [] on Indigenous and tribal peoples is an international treaty adopted by the ILO in 1989. The Convention aims to overcome discriminatory practices affecting Indigenous People and enable them in the decision making process. The fundamental foundations of the Convention are participation and consultation. The requirement for consultation falls upon the Government of the state and not on private persons or companies, this may be delegated but ultimately the responsibility rests on the government. The need for consultation of IPs is written throughout the Convention a number of times and is referred to in : Articles 6, 7, 16 and 22. Article 6(1) states that governments should:\n\n\u201cConsult the peoples concerned, through appropriate procedures and in particular through their representative institutions, whenever consideration is being given to legislative or administrative measures which may affect them directly\" '\n\nArticle 6 (2) states that this consultation will be carried out in good faith and in a form that is appropriate to the circumstances. The aim of this consultation process is to achieve an agreement or consent to the purposed development. The Convention does not allow Indigenous People to veto any developments; the condition is for mere consultation not consent. The supervisor bodies of the ILO have stated that the consultation process cannot only be information sharing that there must be a chance for the Indigenous People to influence the decision making process. If consent is not achieved the nation-state must still respect other areas of the convention that include the Indigenous peoples right to their lands. Such as Article 16 (2) requires that free informed consent must be given where is the relocation of people. The treaty is legally binding on all states that ratify it, if a state chooses to ratify they may need to adjust domestic legislation. In nations such as NZ domestic legislation such as the Resource Management Act 1991 refers to the need to consider in developments Maori relationship with land and water sites. This spiritual and practical connection that Maori have to the land has been considered in a number cases before the court including the supreme court case of Paki v Attorney General.\n\n\n=== United Nations ===\nThe United Nations describes FPIC both directly and indirectly in numerous conventions and treaties. One of the most direct is located in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)[4], Article 19 states:\n\n\"States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the Indigenous Peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them. \u201d\n\nArticle 32 of UNDRIP requires that consultation is carried out with Indigenous Peoples before states can undertake projects that will affect Indigenous People Rights to land, territory and resources  The above Articles only requires Consultation, however Article 10 requires that there is informed consent before the relocation Indigenous Peoples from their land. This allows Indigenous People the right to decide where they live and gives them the power stop any development which they disagree with.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)[5] is the most universally accepted standard of Human Rights. It does not directly mention FPIC but it does express the importance of Self- determination of all Peoples in Article 1. Article 7 declares that all are equal before the law, this means that one person has no more right to another in a nation, this is further endorsed by Article 17 which states that every person has the right to own property and that he shall not be arbitrary deprived of his property. The right for Self-determination is further protected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), in Article 1 of both Documents. This includes economic self-determination, which for many IP is the control of their natural resources.\nThe ICCPR in Article 27 states that minorities shall not be denied access to their culture, in the Human Rights Committee (HRC) in General Comment 23, have found this meaning to include the right of Indigenous People to their land and resources. The HRC has interpreted this to mean that states have a positive duty to engage with IP prior to any development or granting of resource concession in IP lands.\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), the supervisory body of the ICESCR, has even stated in their general comment No.23 that if Indigenous People's land has been taken without informed prior consent then they have the right to restitution or the return of their land or resources. This comes from their interpretation of Article 15 of the ICESCR [6]. Article 15 protects Indigenous People's right to participate in their cultural life. The Comment by the CESCR is important as it goes beyond mere consultation. The need for FPIC has also been called upon by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) [7] which requires that no state shall make a decision concerning the rights of IPs without their consent. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) [8] encourages Indigenous Peoples participation in decision making. However these are not legally binding decisions, only recommendations \n\n\n=== World Bank ===\nThe World Bank [9] was one of the first multilateral financial institutions to create guidelines to protect the rights of Indigenous People's in the 1980s, when it recognized that development negatively impacted the lives and cultures of Indigenous People. Its first policy was in 1987. It was designed by Bank staff without consultation of Indigenous People and was a statement on the need to protect Indigenous People's. Then in 1991 the Bank's Operational Directive 4.20 document acknowledged the need for participation of Indigenous People in the consultation process.\nThe subsequent World Bank Policy on indigenous peoples was released in 2005, OP 4.10 [10] focused on the reduction of poverty. In doing so the bank identified the intrinsic link that Indigenous People have with the land and the need for a consultation process which fully respects the human rights, human dignity, economics and culture of the people involved. The Bank stated that it will not lend money to a state or company unless there has been Free Prior Informed Consultation with the local Indigenous Population and that there is broad community support for the development. Critics have questioned why the term \"consultation\" has been used as opposed to consent. Stating that it means IP are not able to decline a project if they do not agree with it. Furthermore, \"community\" is an ambiguous term. In August 2016 the World Bank adopted its new Environmental and Social Standards, including Environmental and Social Standard 7 (ESS7) on Indigenous Peoples/Sub-Saharan African Historically Underserved Traditional Local Communities (IPs), which requires Free Prior Informed Consent if the project will:\nhave adverse impacts on land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation;\ncause relocation of IPs from land and natural resources subject to traditional ownership or under customary use or occupation; or\nhave significant impacts on IPs cultural heritage that is material to the identity and/or cultural, ceremonial, or spiritual aspects of the affected IPs\u2019 lives.\n\n\n== Climate change negotiations ==\nDuring the UNFCCC climate change negotiations on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), it was noted that the United Nations General Assembly had adopted UNDRIP, meaning that the Declaration and its FPIC provision applied to the negotiations. This reference was made in the context of a so-called safeguard for REDD+, specifically the instruction to have \"respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities\" when undertaking REDD+ activities.\nFollowing this, FPIC has been widely applied for demonstration projects on REDD+, particularly after the United Nations REDD Programme published a report on its efforts to develop a methodology for FPIC for REDD+ in the case of its country program in Vietnam. Early in 2013, the global United Nations REDD Programme issued guidelines for the application of FPIC, including an analysis of jurisprudence on FPIC in various contexts, that are mandatory for all UN-REDD country programmes.\n\n\n== Bolivia ==\nBolivia ratified ILO Convention 169 and in 2007 it also formally incorporated UNDRIP into its municipal law. In 2009 the nation also included the duty to consult Indigenous People's in its constitution, this is however a much less radical version of the draft, which required that consent be given for the exploration of all resource activities. These legal requirements are very significant in a nation that has a wealth of natural resources and a large Indigenous Population. The risk of giving Indigenous People this type of power to veto government projects is an increase social conflict in certain regions. This was seen with the conflict surrounding the Isiboro Se\u00b4cure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS). A road was planned through the Park, coca growers were in favour of the project as it would expand their business. The Indigenous Population however opposed the idea, saying that consent should be needed for mega development in Indigenous Peoples territories. The result was large protests in La Paz. The fear was of damage to the vital river system, illegal logging and altering habitats of endangered animals in the area. The state engaged in consultation with the Indigenous Peoples, but this amplified the problem, with activists critiquing the governments lack of legal framework to protect Indigenous People. The government claimed that the expectations of the Indigenous People were unrealistic.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInformed consent\nResearch ethics\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\nHuman Rights\nIndigenous land rights\n\n\n== References ==",

Jacob Lake is at a road junction leading to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, making the ranger station a major contact point for visitors to Kaibab National Forest until the construction of the Kaibab Plateau Visitor Center. The ranger station comprises a wood-framed cabin and a barn, both adjoining a fenced pasture that surrounds Jacob Lake. The complex was built by the Forest Service in 1910.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe cabin is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 32-foot (9.8 m) wood-framed structure, resting on a limestone foundation. The walls are clad with board-and-batten siding, and the roof is covered with wood shakes, the only surviving board-and-batten cabin in Kaibab National Forest. The long elevation faces Jacob Lake with a shed-roofed porch across the entire side, formerly enclosed, but now restored to its original open configuration. The interior has two rooms, a kitchen and a bedroom, entered by individual doors from the porch.\nThe barn is a 1-1/2 story frame structure with board-and-batten siding on a concrete foundation. The roof slopes saltbox fashion from 1-1/2 stories at the front to one story at the back.\nThe Jacob Lake Ranger Station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1987.\n\n\n== References ==",

Two years later, in 1464, King James appointed him Warden of the Eastern and Middle Marches, in succession to his brother the 4th Earl of Angus on 12 January 1463, and at the same time committed to him the keeping of the castles of Douglas and Tantallon, with their lordships.\nWhen the 5th earl, \"Bell-the-Cat\", came of age in 1470, William Douglas came before the King and ad eius genua prouolutus \u2014 resigned ward of Tantallon and the lordship of Douglas per fustem et baculum in the said earl's favour. The lands which he received upon the forfeiture of his kinsmen, comprising Sunderlandhall in Selkirkshire, Cranston in Midlothian, and Traquair and Leithenhope in Peeblesshire, were erected on 16 January 1464 into the barony of Sunderland in his favour.\nWilliam Douglas of Cluny, sometimes styled lord of Sunderland and sometimes lord of Traquair, died, probably unmarried, before 1475, when his lands of Cluny appear in possession of the 5th Earl of Angus.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLords commissioners of H.M.

            "content": "A non-monotonic logic is a formal logic whose consequence relation is not monotonic. In other words, non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible inferences (cf. defeasible reasoning), i.e., a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract their conclusion(s) based on further evidence. Most studied formal logics have a monotonic consequence relation, meaning that adding a formula to a theory never produces a reduction of its set of consequences. Intuitively, monotonicity indicates that learning a new piece of knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known. A monotonic logic cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default (consequences may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary), abductive reasoning (consequences are only deduced as most likely explanations), some important approaches to reasoning about knowledge (the ignorance of a consequence must be retracted when the consequence becomes known), and similarly, belief revision (new knowledge may contradict old beliefs).\n\n\n== Abductive reasoning ==\nAbductive reasoning is the process of deriving the most likely explanations of the known facts. An abductive logic should not be monotonic because the most likely explanations are not necessarily correct. For example, the most likely explanation for seeing wet grass is that it rained; however, this explanation has to be retracted when learning that the real cause of the grass being wet was a sprinkler. Since the old explanation (it rained) is retracted because of the addition of a piece of knowledge (a sprinkler was active), any logic that models explanations is non-monotonic.\n\n\n== Reasoning about knowledge ==\nIf a logic includes formulae that mean that something is not known, this logic should not be monotonic. Indeed, learning something that was previously not known leads to the removal of the formula specifying that this piece of knowledge is not known. This second change (a removal caused by an addition) violates the condition of monotonicity. A logic for reasoning about knowledge is the autoepistemic logic.\n\n\n== Belief revision ==\nBelief revision is the process of changing beliefs to accommodate a new belief that might be inconsistent with the old ones. In the assumption that the new belief is correct, some of the old ones have to be retracted in order to maintain consistency. This retraction in response to an addition of a new belief makes any logic for belief revision to be non-monotonic. The belief revision approach is alternative to paraconsistent logics, which tolerate inconsistency rather than attempting to remove it.\n\n\n== Proof-theoretic versus model-theoretic formalizations of non-monotonic logics ==\nProof-theoretic formalization of a non-monotonic logic begins with adoption of certain non-monotonic rules of inference, and then prescribes contexts in which these non-monotonic rules may be applied in admissible deductions. This typically is accomplished by means of fixed-point equations that relate the sets of premises and the sets of their non-monotonic conclusions. Defaults logics and autoepistemic logic are the most common examples of non-monotonic logics that have been formalized that way.\nModel-theoretic formalization of a non-monotonic logic begins with restriction of the semantics of a suitable monotonic logic to some special models, for instance, to minimal models, and then derives the set of non-monotonic rules of inference, possibly with some restrictions in which contexts these rules may be applied, so that the resulting deductive system is sound and complete with respect to the restricted semantics. Unlike some proof-theoretic formalizations that suffered from well-known paradoxes and were often hard to evaluate with respect of their consistency with the intuitions they were supposed to capture, model-theoretic formalizations were paradox-free and left little, if any, room for confusion about what non-monotonic patterns of reasoning they covered. Examples of proof-theoretic formalizations of non-monotonic reasoning, which revealed some undesirable or paradoxical properties or did not capture the desired intuitive comprehensions, that have been successfully (consistent with respective intuitive comprehensions and with no paradoxical properties, that is) formalized by model-theoretic means include first-order circumscription, closed-world assumption, and autoepistemic logic.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLogic programming\nNegation as failure\nStable model semantics\nRational consequence relation\n\n\n== References ==\nN.

            "content": "Cinema Papers was an influential Australian film magazine which ran from 1974 to 2001.\n\n\n== History and profile ==\nCinema Papers was first published as a nationally distributed magazine in January 1974. The name was derived, via a single issue magazine produced by students at LaTrobe University in October 1967, from the influential French journal Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma. The magazine was published on a bimonthly basis and had its headquarters in Melbourne. In 1989 Cinema Papers absorbed another film magazine, Filmviews. One of the owners was MTV Publishing Ltd.\nDeclining sales saw Cinema Papers end in 1999. It was relaunched by Niche Media in April 2000 with Michaela Boland as its editor. However, this ultimately proved unsuccessful and the magazine shut for good in 2001. Digitised versions of Cinema Papers are available from the University of Wollongong's archival collection.\nContributing writers include Scott Murray, Philippe Mora and Antony I. Ginnane.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The equilibrium mode [power] distribution of light travelling in an optical waveguide or fiber, is the distribution of light that is no longer changing with fibre length or with input modal excitation. This phenomenon requires both mode filtering and mode mixing to occur in the fibre to produce a state that is independent of the mode power distribution launched by the light source. At propagation distances exceeding the equilibrium length, intramodal pulse distortion increases (bandwidth decreases) as the square root of length.\nThe term equilibrium length is sometimes used to describe a stationary mode distribution, which is the length of multi-mode optical fiber necessary to attain a static mode distribution from a specific excitation condition. Equilibrium length is, strictly, the longest such length, as would result from a widely variable range of input excitation. Other terms for equilibrium length are equilibrium coupling length and equilibrium mode distribution length.\nEquilibrium mode [power] distributions were reported in early multimode transmission systems at propagation distances as short as a few hundred metres. However, as fibre manufacturing improved, the minute waveguide dimensional and structural changes that produce mode-mixing have been greatly reduced. The length of fibre required to attain true equilibrium is now much greater than the length of practical multimode transmission systems, which makes the term effectively obsolete.\nIn the absence of strong mode-mixing, high order mode filtering is the primary remaining mechanism for potential change of an input mode power distribution. If a well-aligned laser is the optical source, the mode power distribution is highly concentrated in the lowest order modes, and remains essentially unchanged with distance due to the lack of mode-mixing. If an optical source that overfills the fibre is used, only the highest order guided mode group experiences excess attenuation, and the mode power distribution becomes slightly filtered as a result. (Mandrel wrapping is a viable method to artificially create this state.) Such mode power distributions are stationary; neither changes with fibre length, but equilibrium does not exist in either case because the distributions remain dependent on the input power distribution.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMode coupling\nMode volume\nMode scrambler\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates public domain material from the General Services Administration document \"Federal Standard 1037C\" (in support of MIL-STD-188).",

            "content": "Teramo [\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0ramo]  listen  is a city and comune in the Italian region of Abruzzo, the capital of the province of Teramo.\nThe city, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from Rome, is situated between the highest mountains of the Apennines (Gran Sasso d'Italia) and the Adriatic coast. The town is located by the confluence of the Vezzola and Tordino rivers, on a hillside area where the terrain features along with the Mediterranean climate make the territory rich in vineyards and olive groves.\nThe economy of the town is mostly based on activities connected with agriculture and commerce, as well as a sound industrial sector: textiles, foods, engineering, building materials and ceramics. Teramo can be reached from the A14 and the A24 motorways.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nThe climate is fresh-temperate. In the coolest month (January) temperatures average 5.5 \u00b0C (41.9 \u00b0F), and in the warmest month (July) they average 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F). In the winter time though they can experience copious amounts of snowfall, as in 2005. The precipitations are not frequent and mostly concentrated in late spring. The summers are characterized by days of somewhat intense heat.\n\n\n== Name ==\nInteramna (Greek: \u1f38\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1: Eth. Interamnas, Interamn\u0101tis) was the name of several cities in different parts of Italy. Its etymology, already pointed out by Varro and Festus, indicates their position at the confluence of two streams. The form \"Interamnium\" (Greek: \u1f38\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), and the ethnic form Interamnis are also found, but more rarely. The name referred to the two rivers Vezzola and Tordino, between which it lies.\nThe name is already defined in extant manuscripts of the Liber Coloniarum into Teramne, whence its modern form of Teramo. But in the Middle Ages it appears to have been known also by the name of Aprutium, supposed to be a corruption of Praetutium, or rather of the name of the people Praetutii, applied (as was so often the case in Gaul) to their chief city. Thus the name Abrutium is present among the cities of Picenum enumerated by the Geographer of Ravenna (iv. 31); and under the Lombards a comes Aprutii is mentioned. The name has been retained in that of Abruzzo, now a region of Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre Roman Age ===\nA settlement of the 1st millennium BC and some buildings of ancient Italic tribes were the object of archaeological excavations. The most ancient historical remains were found in the outskirts of the city, precisely in the neighborhood Madonna delle grazie, where, among many, a burial place with a dagger and a halberd were found. Allegedly, the development of the old settlement was due to the commercial center founded by the Etruscan and Phoenician civilization.\nAccording to the Roman author Sextus Julius Frontinus, the ancient Perut or Pretut (meaning \"Hill surrounded by waters\") strongly developed in dimensions and importance until it became the capital of the Praetutii tribe.\n\n\n=== Roman age ===\nIn the battle of Sentinum (295 BC), the Romans defied the Italian confederation (Sabellians, Etrusci, Umbri and their allies the Gauls, starting the Samnite Wars. In 290 BC the Sabine area, along with the Praetutii\u2019s region was occupied by the legions sent by the consul general Manius Curius Dentatus. The city took the Latin name of Interamnia Praetuttorium (\"City of the Praetutii between two rivers\"). During the reign of Augustus Interamnia is included in the Picenum district. The area of the current province was divided from south to north into the Ager Hatrianus, Ager Praetutianus and Ager Palmense.\nAfter the Second Social War Interamnia became a municipium. The city lost the status of Municipium because of the participation of Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the Social war (91\u201388 BC), but the city will subsequently regain it for expressed will of Julius Caesar.\nDuring the Roman age, thanks to its nearness to the capital of the empire, the city lived a prosperous and favorable moment as proven by the numerous mosaics, theater, thermal baths and the amphitheater remains. As historians like Ptolemy, Livy and Pliny remember, the city reached its best period under the emperor Hadrian, with the constructions of the temples dedicated to Mars and Apollo.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nLittle is known about Teramo in the early Middle Ages, after first destruction of the city in the year 410 by the Visigoths under Alaric I. The Ostrogoths ruled Interamnia 552\u2013554 AD. Right after the Gothic War (6th century), the city became a Byzantine possession. Teramo was included in the Marchia Firmana, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna. Later it was a Lombard fief and part of the Duchy of Spoleto.\nIn 1129 the city was conquered by the Normans, as part of the County of Apulia. In 1140 it became a possession of Roger II of Sicily, the first King of Sicily. During the strife following Roger's coronation, Teramo was destroyed by a Norman force under Robert II of Loritello. Only the tower of Piazza Sant\u2019Anna was saved from this sack; from this moment on it will be called Torre Bruciata (burnt tower). In the 1268 the domination of the House of Hohenstaufen, who had inherited Sicily from Roger II's line, ended; they were replaced by the House of Anjou.\nThe ecclesiastical authority of the Aprutina Diocese, led by the bishops Rainaldo Acquaviva, Niccol\u00f2 degli Arcioni (1317), Stefano da Teramo (1335) and Pietro di Valle (1366) boosted the city's economy, as witnessed by the construction of castles, churches, cloisters and palaces along with the great privileges granted by the sovereigns. Within the following two centuries Teramo became part of the Kingdom of Naples.\n\n\n=== Renaissance and modern era ===\nThe 15th century saw the struggles between the most important families of the city (De Valle and Melatino). The exemplary hanging of 13 followers of Melatino\u2019s family is still remembered in a stone shield in the very center of the city. The monument represents two heads with their tongues out under the writing \u201cA lo parlare agi mesura\u201d (mind what you say).\nDuring the first years of the century, the tyrant Antonello de Valle was assassinated; his castle, located in what is now Garibaldi Square, was demolished. The legend says that the belligerence between the families ended thanks to the women of the city who proclaimed a strike of affection. Despite the internal struggles, the city lived a very developed cultural period in the century. Artists like Jacobello del Fiore and Nicola da Guardiagrele were called to work in the city, which had commercial relationship with Tuscany and Venice.\nAfter the death of Ferdinand II, Charles II of Spain sold Teramo to the Duke of Atri for 40,000 ducats. The people of Teramo rebelled, but with no result. In 1626 Teramo was struck by an earthquake, followed four years later by the plague.

            "content": "The Hymenolepididae are family of cyclophyllid tapeworms. Their characteristic feature is the small number of testes (one to four). The unilateral genital pores and large external seminal vesicle allow for easy recognition. Most species are small, transparent, and easy to study. The family contains over 90 genera with over 900 species, having as their definitive host birds (c. 700 species) or mammals (about 250 species). Most reside in the intestines of their definitive hosts. The majority of species with known lifecycles have arthropods as intermediate hosts.\n\n\n== As human parasites ==\n\nThe family Hymenolepididae has only two species which infects humans: the disease hymenolepiasis is caused by Hymenolepis nana and H. diminuta, which are sometimes classified in the genus Rodentolepis.\nMost cases of hymenolepiasis are caused by H. nana. It occurs worldwide, but in temperate climates, children and people living in institutions are more likely to be infected. A morphologically-identical variety of H. nana, H. nana var. fraterna infects rodents, but the human strain of H. nana is essentially non-infective to rodents. Unlike most tapeworms, including H. diminuta, H. nana can complete its lifecycle without an intermediate host. Pathological effects of infection are rare and occur in massive infections through autoinfection, where the parasite is able to complete its lifecycle within the intestine of the human host, without passing through an intermediate host outside the body. With increasing worm burden, symptoms such as restlessness, irritability, diarrhea, and abdominal pain occur.\nH. diminuta is primarily a parasite of rats, but human infections occur as incidental hosts. It is a larger species than H. nana and lacks hooks on the rostellum; it has three testes per proglottid. Species from a diverse set of arthropod taxa, including earwigs, butterflies, and beetles, can be intermediate hosts for this species, which is unusual for a tapeworm. Grain beetles are common intermediate hosts, because they live in piles of grain where they can be ingested by rats, which are the definitive hosts.\nDrugs commonly used for treatment of hymenolepiasis are praziquantel, niclosamide, and paromomycin.\n\n\n== Selected genera ==\n\n\n== References ==",

The Kiskatinaw Provincial Park is established on the mid course of the river, east of the Alaska Highway, along the old alignment of the highway, at the site of a curved wooden bridge. The bridge was built during the Second World War, when the Alaska Highway was started. It was designed as a curved bridge so enemy troops could not bomb it Due to a hairpin curve, the bridge, which took nine months to be completed, was constructed in a curved shape.\nFishing for walleye pike and rainbow trout is an attraction on the lower course of the river.\nThe river gives the name to the Kiskatinaw Formation, a siliciclastic formation of Carboniferous (Mississippian) age.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe river originates in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, from Bearhole Lake in Bearhole Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area, at an elevation of approximately 1,050 metres (3,440 ft). It flows north and east, where it receives the waters of Sunderman Creek, the north, flowing by One Island Lake Provincial Park, after which it merges with the West Kiskatinaw River. It continues north through the Upper Cutbank, then receives the Brassey Creek. It parallels Highway 52 on the eastern edge of Sunset Prairie, west of Bear Mountain. It is crossed by Highway 97 and then by the Alaska Highway before it turns north-east. It then flows through a canyon until it merges into the Peace River. It flows into the Peace River west of the Alberta/British Columbia border, within the limits of the Peace River Corridor Provincial Park, east of Taylor.\n\n\n== Tributaries ==\nBearhole Lake\nBlackhawk Lake\nSunderman Creek\nBorden Creek\nMinistik Creek\nOne Island Lake\nWest Kiskatinaw River\nOetata Creek\nHalfmoon Creek\n\nBrassey Creek\nTremblay Creek\nFox Creek\nLivingstone Creek\n\nSunset Creek\nCoal Creek\nMica Creek\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of British Columbia rivers\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "David Alan Grier (born June 30, 1956) is an American actor and comedian. He is best known for his work on the sketch comedy television show In Living Color.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOne of three children, Grier was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of mother Aretas Ruth (n\u00e9e Blaney), a school teacher, and father William Henry Grier, a psychiatrist and writer who co-wrote the book Black Rage.\nGrier graduated from Detroit's magnet high school, Cass Tech, and received a B.A. from the University of Michigan, and an M.F.A. from the Yale School of Drama in 1981.\nWhen Grier was young, his family marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. in a March on Poverty in Detroit, where King gave an early version of the \"I Have A Dream\" speech.\n\n\n== Career ==\nImmediately after graduating from Yale, Grier landed the role of Jackie Robinson in the short-lived Broadway musical The First, directed by Martin Charnin and written by Joel Siegel.\nGrier got his start on the National Public Radio radio drama adaptation of Star Wars in 1981. He was the voice of a nameless X-wing fighter pilot during the Battle of Yavin.\nGrier was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and won the Theatre World Award for The First. He later starred as James \"Thunder\" Early in the hit Broadway musical Dreamgirls. Grier made his film debut in 1983 in Streamers, directed by Robert Altman. He won the Golden Lion for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for the film. He also appeared in the Negro Ensemble Company production A Soldier's Play and reprised his role in the film version A Soldier's Story. Grier also appeared as a geology professor at the fictitious Hillman College in the show A Different World where he was a crush of several of the girls on the show including lead character Denise Huxtable played by actress Lisa Bonet.\n\n\n=== In Living Color ===\nAlthough primarily known for his dramatic work, Grier began to shift towards comedy, making memorable appearances in the cult films Amazon Women on the Moon and I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. Keenen Ivory Wayans, the director of Sucka, cast Grier in his new variety show In Living Color. It became a ratings hit and won an Emmy for Outstanding Variety Series. Grier became a popular cast member through his characters, which ranged from hyperactive children to crotchety old men. Among his prominent characters were obnoxious, megaphone-blaring shop teacher Al MacAfee; the elderly Mr. Brooks, whose autumn years are a never-ending verbal battle with his wife; Calhoun Tubbs, a blues musician with very limited creativity; a member of Funky Finger Productions, a production company with more ambition than resources; Tiny, a prison inmate obsessed with female \"breastses\"; and, perhaps most famously, flamboyant and effeminate Antoine Merriweather in the \"Men on...\" sketch series. He also played Rev. Leon Lonnie Love on the TV series Martin. After his success on the show, Grier began appearing in comedies such as Boomerang (as Eddie Murphy's shy friend Gerard), Blankman (with Damon Wayans), In the Army Now (as Fred Ostroff) along with Pauly Shore and Andy Dick in 1994, and as a policeman whose car is memorably crushed and eaten by a giant pod in Jumanji. Grier appeared with Tom Arnold in the 1997 comedy McHale's Navy as Ensign Charles Parker. In 1999, he made a guest appearance as himself in the \"Aw, Here it Goes to Hollywood\" episode of Nickelodeon's sitcom, Kenan & Kel.\n\n\n=== Acting career ===\nAfter the cancellation of In Living Color, Grier starred in the short-lived sitcoms The Preston Episodes, Damon (with In Living Color co-star Damon Wayans), and DAG.\nGrier had a cameo in the Robert De Niro and Edward Burns movie 15 Minutes as a Central Park mugger. In a departure from the childlike roles he often played on In Living Color, he portrayed an abusive father in Rusty Cundieff's anthology film Tales from the Hood. He began doing stand-up comedy and began hosting the Comedy Central series Premium Blend. He was ranked no. 94 on Comedy Central 100 Greatest Stand-Ups.\nGrier returned to Broadway to perform in the musical A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. In 2002, Grier joined the cast of the improv-based ABC sitcom and Bonnie Hunt vehicle Life with Bonnie which ran only two seasons. During this time, he continued to appear in comedy films but also returned to drama in the films Baadasssss! and The Woodsman. He starred in his own Comedy Central stand-up special The Book of David: The Cult Figure's Manifesto. He is also a frequent guest on the Comedy Central show Crank Yankers. Grier was the host of the NBC show Thank God You're Here. He also appeared in the revival production of The Wiz at the La Jolla Playhouse directed by Des McAnuff.\nGrier starred in Gym Teacher: The Movie playing the villain, Shelly Bragg. He appeared as Uncle Henry in the ABC 2005 television movie The Muppets' Wizard of Oz.\nIn October 2008, Grier hosted Chocolate News, a Comedy Central spoof of a TV news magazine show. Comedy Central did not renew the show for a second season.\nGrier appeared as Sugar Bear in the 2009 movie Dance Flick. He also provided the voice for Kobe Bryant in the Nike puppet commercials.\nHe returned to Broadway for the premiere of Race, written and directed by David Mamet, opposite James Spader, Kerry Washington, and Richard Thomas, which opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on December 6, 2009. Grier received his second Tony Award nomination for his role.\nGrier most recently appeared on Broadway as Sportin' Life in the Gershwins' Porgy and Bess, which opened at the Richard Rodgers Theatre on January 12, 2012, alongside Norm Lewis and Audra McDonald. He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical for this role. In addition to his Tony Award nomination, Grier received a 2013 Grammy nomination for Best Musical Theater Album for his performance on the cast recording of the play.\nGrier guest-starred in Season 6 of FOX's Bones. He played Professor Bunsen Jude the Science Dude, the host of a children's TV program.

The series also featured actors Sara Gilbert, Ryan Hansen, Kristin Davis, and Sara Rodier.\nHe played the Cowardly Lion in NBC's live performance of The Wiz, which aired on December 3, 2015.\n\n\n=== Loveline ===\nHe was often referred to as the third host of the radio show Loveline, as he was a frequent guest and guest host (usually filling in for Adam Carolla). One of his most famous contributions was a bit where he began calling out various pharmaceutical drugs Dr. Drew was recommending to a caller as though they were the names of black children being yelled at by their parents. The episode aired on September 7, 2005, towards the end of the show.\nIn another notable episode - that of September 25, 2002 - Grier stopped by to lament his recent breakup with his girlfriend of four years. He had just found out she had been cheating on him with several famous actors; he coughed while saying the names to avoid legal difficulties. During the show Engineer Anderson slowed down the recording and played it back, and the listeners were able to discern the names Tom Sizemore, Colin Farrell, and Cuba Gooding Jr..\nGrier's supposed last appearance on Loveline was April 16, 2006. On his MySpace page, Grier posted:\nOn March 3, 2009, Grier was a guest on The Adam Carolla Podcast. He explained that the reason he was not asked back on Loveline was that the producers of the show did not want him back on despite Dr. Drew pressing for him to continue to be a guest. While Dr. Drew was not open with him about this at the beginning, Grier felt no resentment toward him and Dr. Drew has since apologized for what happened. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Drew explained what had happened on Loveline and expressed his intent to petition the producers for Grier to return. On August 10, 2009, after a gap of over three years, Grier was once again on Loveline, joining former host Adam Carolla and Dr. Bruce Heischober.\n\n\n=== The Adam Carolla Show ===\nGrier has made many guest appearances on the Adam Carolla Show, usually to plug his improv performances. One of his recurring bits is where he enacts a heavy-set black woman named Peanut who does a terrible job answering the phones for The Adam Carolla Show.

He did this by snoring loudly while Alison read the news and also by referring to her as \"Teresa\" or \"Fake Teresa,\" the name of Alison's predecessor Teresa Strasser.\n\n\n=== Dancing with the Stars ===\nDavid was a contestant on the 8th season of Dancing with the Stars, partnered with Kym Johnson.

She gave birth to their daughter, Luisa Danbi Grier-Kim on January 10, 2008, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles. On June 9, 2009, according to TMZ, Kim filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.\nHe is a fan of motorcycles and owns the rare Yamaha YZF-R1 Limited Edition.

            "content": "Marshall Walter \"Major\" Taylor (November 26, 1878 \u2013 June 21, 1932) was an American track cyclist who began his amateur career while he was still a teenager in Indianapolis, Indiana. He became a professional racer in 1896, at the age of 18, and won the sprint event at the 1899 world track championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to become the first African American to achieve the level of world champion and the second black athlete to win a world championship in any sport. Taylor also set numerous world records in the sprint discipline in race distances ranging from the quarter-mile (0.4 km) to the two-mile (3.2 km). Taylor was an American sprint champion in 1899 and 1900, and competed races in the U.S., Europe and Australasia. He retired in 1910, at the age of 32, to his home in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nIn 1928, Taylor self-published his autobiography, The Fastest Bicycle Rider in the World, but severe financial difficulties forced him into poverty. He spent the final two years of his life in Chicago, Illinois, where he died in 1932. Throughout his athletic career Taylor challenged the racial prejudice he encountered on and off the velodrome and became a pioneering role model for other athletes facing racial discrimination. Taylor was inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1989. Other tributes include memorials and historic markers in Indianapolis, Worcester, and at his gravesite in Chicago. Several cycling clubs, trails, and events in the U.S. have been named in his honor, as well as the Major Taylor Velodrome in Indianapolis and Major Taylor Boulevard in Worcester. Taylor has also been memorialized in a television mini-series and a song.\n\n\n== Early life and amateur career ==\n\n\n=== Childhood and introduction to cycling ===\nMarshall Walter Taylor was the son of Gilbert Taylor, a Civil War veteran, and Saphronia Kelter Taylor. His parents migrated from Louisville, Kentucky, and settled on a farm in Bucktown, a rural area on the western edge of Indianapolis, Indiana. Taylor, who was born on November 26, 1878, in Indianapolis was one of eight children in the family that included five girls and three boys. Around 1887, his father began working in Indianapolis as a coachman for the Southards, a wealthy white family.\nWhen Taylor was a child he occasionally accompanied his father to work. Taylor soon became a close friend of the Southards's son, Daniel, who was the same age. From the age of eight until he was twelve, Taylor lived with the family and along with Daniel was tutored at their home. Taylor's living arrangement with the Southards provided him with more advantages than his parents could provide; however, this period of his life abruptly ended when the Southards moved to Chicago, Illinois. Taylor, who remained in Indianapolis, returned to live at his parents' home and \"was soon thrust into the real world.\"\nThe Southards provided 12-year-old Taylor with his first bicycle. By 1891 or early 1892, he had become such an expert trick rider that Tom Hay, an Indianapolis bicycle shop owner, hired him to perform bicycle stunts in front of the Hay and Willits bicycle shop. Taylor earned $6 a week for cleaning the shop and performing the stunts, plus a free bicycle worth $35. It is likely that Taylor received his nickname of \"Major\" because he performed the cycling stunts wearing a military uniform.\n\nTaylor left the Hay and Willits shop in 1892 or early 1893 to take a job as head trainer for Harry T. Hearsey's bicycle shop in Indianapolis, teaching local residents how to ride. About two years later, while working at Hearsey's shop, Taylor met Louis D. \"Birdie\" Munger, a former high-wheel bicycle racer who owned the Munger Cycle Manufacturing Company, a racing bicycle factory in Indianapolis. (Munger later established the Worcester Cycle Manufacturing Company factory in Worcester, Massachusetts.) With a shared interest in bicycle racing, the two became friends and Munger hired the teenaged Taylor to work odd jobs that included sending Taylor to area high schools and colleges to train cyclists and promote Munger's line of racing bicycles. Munger had also \"made up his mind to make Taylor a champion\" and coached him to become a racer. While working for Munger, Taylor joined the See-Saw Cycling Club, an all-black cycling club in Indianapolis.\n\n\n=== Early years and East Coast move ===\nTaylor began entering amateur bicycle races around 1892, while in his early teens, and continued until 1896, when he became a professional racer. Although he competed in road and track races during his amateur career, Taylor excelled in the track sprints, especially the one-mile (1.6 km) race. Taylor won his first cycling race, a ten-mile (16 km) amateur event in Indianapolis in 1892. He received a 50-minute handicap (head start) in the road race because of his young age. Taylor also traveled to Peoria, Illinois, to compete in another meet, winning third place in the under-16 age category.\nTaylor encountered racial prejudice throughout his racing career from some of his competitors. In addition, some local track owners feared that other cyclists would refuse to compete if Taylor was present for a bicycle race and banned him from their tracks. In 1893, for example, after 15-year-old Taylor beat a one-mile amateur track record, he was \"hooted\" and then barred from the track.\nMajor Taylor won his first significant cycling competition on June 30, 1895, when he was the only rider to finish a grueling 75-mile (121 km) road race near his hometown of Indianapolis. During the race Taylor received threats from his white competitors, who did not know that he had entered the event until the start of the race. A few days later, on July 4, 1895, Taylor won a ten-mile road race in Indianapolis that made him eligible to compete at the national championships for black racers in Chicago. Later that summer, he won the ten-mile championship race in Chicago by ten lengths and set a new record for black cyclists of 27:32.\n\nIn 1895, Taylor and Munger relocated from Indianapolis to Worcester. At that time it was a center of the U.S. bicycle industry that included half a dozen factories and thirty bicycle shops. Munger, who was Taylor's employer, lifelong friend, and mentor, had decided to move his bicycle manufacturing business to the state of Massachusetts, which was also a more tolerant area of the country.\nMunger and Charles Boyd, a business partner, established the Worcester Cycle Manufacturing Company with factories in Worcester, and Middletown, Connecticut. For Taylor, who continued to work for Munger as a bicycle mechanic and messenger between the company's two factory locations, the move to the East Coast offered \"higher visibility, larger crowds, increased sponsorship dollars, and greater access to world-class cycling venues.\" After Taylor's relocation to Massachusetts, he joined the all-black Albion Cycling Club in 1895 and trained at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Worcester. Taylor is first mentioned in The New York Times on September 26, 1895, as a competitor in the Citizen Handicap event, a ten-mile race on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. Taylor raced with a 1:30 handicap in a field of 200 competitors that included nine scratch riders.\nIn 1896, Taylor entered numerous races in the Northeastern states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut. After winning a ten-mile road race in Worcester, Taylor competed in the 25-mile (40 km) Irvington\u2013Millburn race in New Jersey, also known as the Derby of the East. Within half a mile (0.8 km) of the finish line, someone startled Taylor by tossing ice water into his face and he finished in 23rd place. Taylor's first major East Coast race was in a League of American Wheelmen (LAW) one-mile contest in New Haven, Connecticut, where he started in last place but won the event. In August 1896, Taylor made a trip to Indianapolis, where he set an unofficial new track record of 2:11 \u200b1\u20445 for a distance of one mile at the Capital City velodrome, beating Walter Sanger's official track record of 2:19 \u200b2\u20445. (Taylor could not compete with Sanger, a professional racer, in a head-to-head contest because he was still an amateur.) Taylor's final amateur race took place on November 26, 1896, in the 25-mile Tatum Handicap at Jamaica, New York. Taylor finished the race in 14th place.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== 1896: First races ===\n\nTaylor turned professional in 1896, at the age of eighteen, and soon emerged as the \"most formidable racer in America.\" Taylor's first professional race took place in front of an 5,000 spectators on December 5, 1896. He competed in a half-mile handicap event on an indoor track at New York City's Madison Square Garden II on the opening day of a multi-day event. Although the main event was a six-day race from December 6\u201312, other contests in shorter distances were held on December 5 to entertain the crowd. These races included the half-mile handicap for professionals in which Taylor competed, a half-mile race between Jay Eaton and Teddy Goodman, and a half-mile scratch race. In addition, there were half-mile scratch and handicap races for amateurs.\nTaylor began the half-mile handicap race on December 5, with a 35-yard (32 m) advantage over the scratch racers. He beat a field of competitors that included Tom Cooper, Philadelphia's A. C. Meixwell, and scratch rider E. C. Bald, who represented New York's Syracuse, and rode a Barnes bicycle. Taylor won the race riding Munger's \"Birdie Special\" bicycle and beat Bald by 20 yards (18 m) in a sprint to the finish.\nFrom December 6\u201312, 1896, Taylor participated as one of 28 competitors in a six-day event at Madison Square Garden. Although Taylor had just become a professional, he had achieved enough notoriety, possibly because of his stunning win on December 5, to be listed among the \"American contestants\" that also included A. A. Hansen (the Minneapolis \"rainmaker\") and Teddy Goodman. In addition, many \"experts from abroad\" participated in the meet such as Switzerland's Albert Schock, Germany's Frank J. Waller, Frank Forster, and Ed von Hoeg, and Canada's B. W. Pierce. Several countries were represented in the event, including Scotland, Wales, France, England, and Denmark.\nAs the fascination with six-day races spread across the Atlantic from its origins in the United Kingdom, their appeal to base instincts attracted large crowds. The more spectators who paid at the gate, the bigger the prizes, which provided riders with the incentive to stay awake\u2013or be kept awake\u2013in order to ride the greatest distance. To prepare for the event, Taylor went to Brooklyn, where he became a member of the South Brooklyn Wheelmen. An estimated crowd of 6,000 spectators attended the final day of the Madison Square Garden races in December 1896. During these long, grueling races, riders suffered delusions and hallucinations, which may have been caused by exhaustion, lack of sleep, or perhaps use of drugs.\nMadison Square Garden's six-day event in 1896 was the longest race Taylor had ever entered. After Taylor refused to continue racing on the final day of the long-distance competition, exhausted from physical exertion and lack of sleep, a Bearnings reporter overheard him comment: \"I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand.\" Taylor completed a total of 1,732 miles (2,787 km) in 142 hours of racing to finish in eighth place. Teddy Hale, the race winner, completed 1,910 miles (3,070 km) and took home $5,000 in prize money. Taylor never competed in any other six-day race.\nAfter Taylor's move to the East Coast in 1896, he initially lived in Worcester, where he worked for Munger, and in Middletown, the site of another of Munger's cycle factories. Taylor also lived in other eastern cities, such as South Brooklyn, where he once trained, but it is not known how long he still resided in New York after he became a professional racer.\n\n\n=== 1897\u20131898: Fame and records ===\n\nTaylor initially raced for Munger's Worcester Cycle Manufacturing Company. After the company went into receivership in 1897 he joined other racing teams. Taylor competed in his first full year on the professional racing circuit in 1897. Early in the season, at the Bostonian Cycle Club's \"Blue Ribbon Meet\" on May 19, 1897, Taylor rode a Comet bicycle to win first place in the one-mile open professional race. On June 26, he won a quarters-mile (0.4 km) race at the track at Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn. Taylor also beat Eddie Bald in a one-mile race in Reading, Pennsylvania, but finished fourth in the prestigious LAW convention in Philadelphia.\nAs a professional racer Taylor continued to experience racial prejudice as a black cyclist in a white-dominated sport. In November and December 1897, when the circuit extended to the racially-segregated South, local race promoters refused to let Taylor compete because he was black. Taylor returned to Massachusetts for the remainder of the season and Eddie Bald became the American sprint champion in 1897. Despite the obstacles, Taylor was determined to race.\nIn the early years of his professional racing career, Taylor's reputation continued to increase as he competed in and won more races. Newspapers began referring to him as the \"Worcester Whirlwind,\" the \"Black Cyclone,\" the \"Ebony Flyer,\" the \"Colored Cyclone,\" and the \"Black Zimmerman,\" among other nicknames. He also gained popularity among the spectators. One of his biggest supporters was President Theodore Roosevelt who kept track of Taylor throughout his seventeen-year racing career.\n\nEarly in the 1898 racing season Taylor beat Bald at Manhattan Beach, but lost to Eddie McDuffie at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a 30-mile (48 km) paced race. On July 17 at Philadelphia, Taylor won his biggest victories of the season: first place in the one-mile championship and second place in the one-mile handicap races. On August 27, in a head-to-head race with Jimmy Michael of Wales, Taylor set a new world record of 1:41 \u200b2\u20445 for a one-mile paced match and beat the Welsh racer to the finish by 20 yards (18 m).\nTaylor was among several top cyclists who could claim the national championship in 1898; however, scoring variations and the formation of a new cycling league that year \"clouded\" his claim to the title. Early in the year a group of professional racers that included Taylor had left the LAW to join a rival group, the American Racing Cyclists' Union (ARCU), and its professional racing group, the National Cycling Association (NCA). During the ARCU sprint championship in St. Louis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, Taylor, who was a devout Baptist, refused to compete for religious reasons in the finals of the championship races because they were held on a Sunday. As a result of Taylor's decision not to race in the finals at Cape Girardeau, the ARCU suspended him from membership. Taylor petitioned the LAW for reinstatement in 1898 and was accepted, but Tom Butler, who had remained a LAW member after the break-up, was declared the League\u2019s champion that year.\nDuring 1898\u201399, at the peak of his cycling career, Taylor established seven world records; the quarter-mile, the one-third-mile (0.5 km), the half-mile, the two-thirds-mile (1.1 km), the three-quarters-mile (1.2 km), the one-mile, and the two-mile (3.2 km) distances. His one-mile world record of 1:41 from a standing start stood for 28 years.\n\n\n=== 1899: World sprint champion ===\n\nAt the 1899 world championships in Montreal, Canada, Taylor won the one-mile sprint, to become the first African American to win a world championship in cycling. Taylor was the second black athlete, after Canadian bantamweight boxer George Dixon of Boston, to win a world championship in any sport. Taylor won the one-mile world championship sprint in a close finish a few feet ahead of Frenchman Courbe d'Outrelon and American Tom Butler. In addition, Taylor placed second in the two-mile championship sprint at Montreal behind Charles McCarthy and won the half-mile championship race. Because the finals were held on Sundays, when Taylor refused to compete for religious reasons, he did not compete in another world championship contest until 1909 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Taylor lost in a preliminary heat at Copenhagen and did not compete in the finals.\nAfter Taylor's world championship win in 1899, many claimed that the event \"had been a farce, because Taylor had not competed against the strongest riders.\" World cycling's governing body, the International Cycling Association (replaced with the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1900), did not allow NCA racers to compete at the world championships in Montreal. As a result, Taylor's accomplishments were somewhat diminished. Because the rival organizations (LAW and the NCA) would not recognize each other, two American champions were crowned in 1899. Tom Cooper was the NCA champion and Taylor was the LAW champion.\nIn addition to the world championship wins in the one-mile and two-mile distances at Montreal and the LAW Championship, which he won on points, Taylor's victories in 1899 included twenty-two first-place finishes in major championship races around the U.S. Taylor's record-setting times were impossible to dismiss. No other rider had matched the \"range and variety\" of his winning performances, which made him an international celebrity. In 1899, Taylor made several unsuccessful attempts to recapture his world record for a one-mile paced distance in two \"strenuous record-breaking campaigns,\" before he finally achieved the new world record of 1:19 in November to regain the title of \"the fastest man in the world.\"\nFor the 1899 racing season, Taylor went to Syracuse and with Munger's assistance he signed a contract to race for the E. C. Stearns Company. Taylor, Munger, and Harry Sager, who was Taylor's bicycle parts sponsor, initially planned to negotiate a deal with the Olive Wheel Company; however, the men were able to work out a more lucrative contract with Stearns, who agreed to build Taylor's bicycles using a chainless gear mechanism that Sanger had designed. The bicycles only weighed about 20 pounds (9.1 kg) and had an 88-inch (2,200 mm) gear for sprinting and a 120-inch (3,000 mm) gear for longer, paced runs. Stearns \"also agreed to build Taylor a revolutionary steam-powered pacing tandem, behind which he could attack world records and challenge the leading exponents of paced racing.\" Although the tandem was temperamental, it helped Taylor break Eddie McDuffie's one-mile world record on November 15, 1899, with a time of 1:19 at a speed of 45.56 mph (73.32 km/h). In late 1899, Taylor signed a contract to race with the Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works team of Fitchburg, Massachusetts, during the 1900 racing season.\n\n\n=== 1900: American sprint champion ===\nIn 1900, when the LAW no longer governed professional bicycle races in the U.S., Taylor's future as a professional racer was in jeopardy. Fortunately, the ARCU and the NCA, who had banned Taylor from competing in their leagues, readmitted him after payment of a $500 fine. Taylor won the American sprint championship on points in 1900. He also beat Tom Cooper, the 1899 NCA champion, in a head-to-head match in a one-mile race at Madison Square Garden in front of 50,000 to 60,000 spectators. In addition, Taylor set world records in the half-mile and two-thirds-mile sprints, and raced indoors using a \"home trainer\" in head-to-head competitions with other riders as a vaudeville act. Taylor eventually settled in Worcester, where he purchased a home on Hobson Street in 1900.\n\n\n=== 1901\u20131903: Europe and Australasia ===\n\nFollowing his record-setting successes in the U.S. and Canada, Taylor agreed to a European tour. In 1901, Taylor made his first trip to Europe, but returned to compete in the U.S. after the conclusion of the European spring racing season. During his European tour Taylor still refused to race on Sundays, when most of the finals were held, because of his religious convictions. It was reported that Taylor took a Bible with him when he traveled and began each race with a silent prayer because of his religious beliefs.\nTaylor was popular among the European race fans and news reporters: \"Everywhere he went he was mobbed, talked about, or written up.\" In 1901, Taylor won 42 of the 57 European races he entered. A highlight of Taylor's European tour in 1901 were two match races with French champion Edmond Jacquelin at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Jacquelin won the first match by two lengths; Taylor won the second match by four lengths.\nTaylor also participated in a European tour in 1902, when he entered 57 races and won 40 of them to defeat the champions of Germany, England, and France. In addition to racing in Europe, Taylor also competed in Australia and New Zealand in 1903 and 1904. In February 1903, for example, Taylor competed in the Sydney handicap for a $5,000 prize. A headline that flashed worldwide was \"Rich Cycle Race.\" During his world tour in 1903 Taylor earned prize money estimated at $35,000 ($923,352 in 2015 chained dollars).\n\n\n=== 1907\u20131910: Later years ===\n\nFollowing a collapse from the mental and physical strain of professional competition, Taylor took a two-and-a-half year hiatus from cycling between 1904 and 1906, before returning to race in France. He set two world records in Paris in 1907 for the half-mile standing start at 0:42 \u200b1\u20445 and the quarter-mile standing start at 0:25 \u200b2\u20445. Taylor also returned to Europe for the racing season in 1908 and in 1909. He finally broke his long-standing decision to avoid Sunday races in 1909 when he was nearing the end of his racing career. Taylor's last professional race took place on October 10, 1909, in Roanne, France, in a match race against French world champion Charles Dupr\u00e9. Taylor won the race, but he did not return to Europe for the 1910 season and retired from competitive cycling.\nTaylor was still breaking records in 1908, but his age was starting to \"creep up on him.\" He retired from racing in 1910 at the age of 32. When Taylor returned to his home in Worcester at the end of his racing career, his estimated net worth was $75,000 ($1,978,611 in 2015 chained dollars) to $100,000 ($2,638,148 in 2015 chained dollars). Taylor won his final competition, an \"old-timers race\" among former professional racers, in New Jersey in September 1917.\n\n\n== Racism in cycling ==\n\nAs Taylor gained notoriety as an amateur and a professional, he did not escape racial segregation. The 1890s was the decade that saw the highest number of recorded lynchings in the U.S. In 1894, the LAW changed its bylaws to exclude blacks from membership; however, it did permit them to compete in its races. Although Taylor's cycling was greatly celebrated abroad, particularly in France, his career was still restricted by racism, particularly in the Southern U.S., where some local promoters would not permit Taylor to compete against white cyclists. Some restaurants and hotels also refused to serve him or provide him lodging.\nTaylor asserted in his autobiography that prominent bicycle racers of his era often cooperated to defeat him, such as the Butler brothers (Nat and Tom) were accused of doing in the one-mile world championship race at Montreal in 1899. At the LAW races in Boston, shortly after Taylor had won the world championship, he accused the entire field that included Tom Cooper and Eddie Bald, among others for fouling him. Taylor complained after the event that he had been \"bumped, jostled, and elbowed until I was sorely tried.\" Racing promoter William A. Brady, who was also Taylor's manager, chastised the other riders for their \"rough treatment\" of Taylor during the race.\nWhile some of Taylor's fellow racers refused to compete with him, others resorted to intimidation, verbal insults, and threats to physically harm him. While racing in Savannah, Georgia in the Winter of 1898, he received a written threat saying \"Clear out if you value your life\"; the previous day Taylor had challenged three riders together to a race after one of them had said they \"didn't pace niggers.\" Taylor recalled that ice water had been thrown at him during races and nails were scattered in front of his wheels. Taylor further stated in his autobiography that he had been elbowed and \"pocketed\" (boxed in) by other riders to prevent him from sprinting to the front of the pack, a tactic at which he was so successful.\nTaylor's competitors also tried to injure him. One incident occurred after the one-mile Massachusetts Open race at Taunton on September 23, 1897; at the conclusion of the race, William Becker, who placed third behind Taylor in second place, tackled Taylor on the race track and choked him into unconsciousness. Becker, who claimed that Taylor had crowded him during the race, was temporarily suspended while the incident was investigated. Becker received a $50 fine as punishment for his actions, but was reinstated and allowed to continue racing. In another incident, which occurred on February 1904, when Taylor was competing in Australia, he was seriously injured on the final turn of a race when fellow competitor Iver Lawson veered his bicycle toward Taylor and collided with his front wheel. Taylor crashed and lay unconscious on the track before he was taken to a local hospital and later made a full recovery. Lawson was suspended from racing anywhere in the world for a year as a result of his actions.\n\nTaylor explained that he included details of these incidents in his autobiography, along with his comments about his experiences, to serve as an inspiration for other African American athletes trying to overcome racial prejudice and discriminatory treatment in sports. Taylor cited exhaustion as well as the physical and mental strain caused by the racial prejudice he experienced on and off the track as his reasons for retiring from competitive cycling in 1910. His advice to African American youths wishing to emulate him straightforward was that although bicycle racing had been the appropriate route to success for him, he would not recommend it in general. He suggested that individuals \"practice clean living, fair play and good sportsmanship\" and develop their best talent with a strong character, significant willpower, and \"physical courage.\" Despite many obstacles, Taylor rose to the top of his sport and became \"one of the dominant athletes of his era.\"\n\n\n== Retirement ==\n\nDuring the early years of his retirement, Taylor wrote and self-published his autobiography, The Fastest Bicycle Rider in the World: The Story of a Colored Boy's Indomitable Courage and Success Against Great Odds: An Autobiography (1928). According to his book, Taylor was upbeat about his retirement: \"I felt I had my day, and a wonderful day it was too.\" Taylor also claimed he had no regrets and \"no animosity toward any man,\" but his autobiography included hints of bitterness in regard to his treatment as a competitor: \"I always played the game fairly and tried my hardest, although I was not always given a square deal or anything like it.\"\nAfter retiring from competition, Taylor applied to Worcester Polytechnic Institute to study engineering, despite the fact that he did not have a high school diploma, but he was denied admission and took up various business ventures. By 1930 Taylor had experienced severe financial difficulties from bad investments (including self-publishing his autobiography), the stock market crash, and businesses that proved unsuccessful. Taylor's home in Worcester and some of the family's personal property were sold to pay off debts. He also suffered from persistent ill health in his later years.\nLittle is known of Taylor's life after the failure of his marriage and his move to Chicago around 1930. Taylor spent the final two years of his life in poverty, selling copies of his autobiography to earn a meagre income and residing at the YMCA Hotel in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nIn March 1932, Taylor suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized in the Cook County Hospital's charity ward, where he died on June 21, 1932, at age 53. The official cause of on his death certificate is \"nephrosclerosis and hypertension,\" contributed by \"Chronic myocarditis\". His wife and daughter, who survived him, did not immediately learn of his death and no one claimed his remains. He was initially buried at Mount Glenwood Cemetery in Thornton Township, Cook County, Illinois, (near Chicago) in an unmarked pauper's grave. In 1948, a group of former professional bicycle racers used funds donated by Frank W. Schwinn, owner of the Schwinn Bicycle Co. at that time, to organize the exhumation and reburial of Taylor's remains in a more prominent location at the cemetery. The plaque at the grave reads: \"Dedicated to the memory of Marshall W. 'Major' Taylor, 1878\u20131932. World's champion bicycle racer who came up the hard way without hatred in his heart, an honest, courageous and god-fearing, clean-living, gentlemanly athlete. A credit to the race who always gave out his best. Gone but not forgotten.\".\nTaylor's legacy lies in his willingness to challenge racial prejudice as an African American athlete in the white-dominated sport of cycling. He was also hailed as a sports hero in France and Australia. Taylor, who became a role model for other athletes facing racial prejudice and discrimination, was \"the first great black celebrity athlete\" and a pioneer in his efforts to challenge segregation in sports. He also paved the way for others facing similar circumstances. Taylor explained in his autobiography that he had no other African Americans to offer him advice and \"therefore had to blaze my own trail.\"\n\n\n=== Honors and tributes ===\n\nThe Major Taylor Velodrome in Indianapolis was opened in July 1982 for the U.S. Olympic Festival. Taylor was posthumously inducted into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame in 1989. In July 2006, Worcester renamed part of Worcester Center Boulevard, a high-traffic street, as Major Taylor Boulevard to honor his athletic feats as well as his character. In April 2002, Taylor was one of the nine track cyclists inducted into the UCI Hall of Fame, created to commemorate 100 years of the Paris\u2013Roubaix one-day road race and the inauguration of the World Cycling Centre. In May 2008, the Major Taylor Association commissioned Antonio Tobias Mendez to create a sculpture to honor Taylor. The monument is installed in front of the Worcester Public Library in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 2009, the Indiana Historical Bureau, Central Indiana Bicycling Association Foundation, and the Indiana State Fair Commission installed a state historical marker as a tribute to Taylor near the Indiana State Fairgrounds in Indianapolis. The marker is located at the intersection of Thirty-Eighth Street and the Monon Trail, close to the site where he had set an unofficial track record in 1896.\nA bike path in Chicago is named in Taylor's honor. In September 2010, Columbus, Ohio, renamed its Alum Creek Trail bike path the Major Taylor Bikeway. The first of the many cycling clubs named in Taylor's honor was organized in Columbus, in 1979. In 2002, a group of African American students at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, named their Little 500 team in Taylor's honor. In 2009, the Cascade Bicycle Club community organization of Washington launched The Major Taylor Project, a youth cycling program.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nActor Philip Morris portrayed Taylor in the 1992 television mini-series Tracks of Glory. Blues musician Otis Taylor (no relation) recorded \"He Never Raced on Sunday,\" a song about Taylor for his 2004 album Double V. In 2007, Nike produced the Major Taylor \"premium\" collection of their most iconic sneakers in a light brown/neon yellow/white colorway. SOMA Fabrications makes a set of bicycle handlebars called the Major Taylor Bar, which is a replica of 1930s drop handlebar that was name for Taylor. Dewshane Williams portrayed Taylor in the Murdoch Mysteries episode, Tour de Murdoch.\n\n\n== Marriage and family ==\n\nTaylor married Daisy Victoria Morris in Ansonia, Connecticut, on March 21, 1902. Morris was born on January 28, 1876, in Hudson, New York. Taylor met her around 1900 when she was living in Worcester, with her aunt and uncle.\nWhile in Australia in 1904, Taylor and his wife had their only child, a daughter that they named Rita Sydney in honor of Sydney, where she was born on May 11. When Taylor, his wife, and daughter were not traveling, they lived in a large home on Hobson Avenue in Worcester that Taylor had purchased in 1900.\nAfter his retirement from racing in 1910 and the failure of subsequent business ventures in the 1920s, Taylor and his wife became estranged. She left him in 1930 and moved to New York City. Around the same time Taylor left Worcester and moved to Chicago; he never saw his wife or daughter again.\nTaylor's daughter, who graduated from the Sargent School of Physical Culture in Boston in 1925 and the University of Chicago in 1936, taught physical education at Virginia State University. She died in 2005 at age 101; her survivors include a son, Dallas C. Brown Jr., and his five children. In 1984, Taylor's daughter donated an extensive scrapbook collection on her father to the University of Pittsburgh Archives.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of African-American firsts\nList of African-American sports firsts\nList of cyclists\nList of doping cases in cycling\nList of former students of the Conservatoire de Paris\nList of Indiana state historical markers in Marion County\nList of people from Indianapolis\nList of people from Worcester, Massachusetts\nThomas Gascoyne\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Major Taylor Association\nThe Major Taylor Society\nMarshall Taylor at Find a Grave",

            "content": "Nothing But the Truth: A Documentary Novel is a 1992 novel written by Avi. The book is a young adult novel in a modified epistolary style through diary entries, personal letters, school memos and transcripts of dialogue. It tells the story of an incident in a New Hampshire town called Harrison where a boy is suspended from school for humming the United States National Anthem as well as the effects of this story receiving national publicity. The main theme of the novel is the subjectivity of truth and that while individual statements may be true, taken separately they may not give an accurate picture of an event.\nNothing But the Truth won a 1992 Newbery Honor. The novel was later adapted into a play.\n\n\n== Plot Summary ==\nPhilip Malloy is a track-obsessed ninth grader at Harrison High School in New Hampshire. He blames his English teacher, Margaret Narwin, for his poor performance in her class, and he earns a D for his grade. Since he is no longer eligible to try out for the track team, he avoids telling his parents and instead pretends that he no longer has an interest in trying out. Throughout his time in school, the number of class time disturbances increases. His humming the national anthem when he's meant to stand \"at silent, respectful attention. Mrs.Narwin asks him to stop multiple times. After three days of humming, he is given the chance to apologize to Narwin for his disrespect towards her. After Philip refuses to express regret, Vice Principal Dr. Joseph Palleni is called by district mandated procedure to suspend him for a two days. Philip then tells his parents that he was suspended for singing the National Anthem. Mr. Malloy (Philip's father), shares this with their neighbor, Ted Griffen, who arranges an interview between Philip and a local journalist named Jennifer Stewart. Ms. Stewart decides to pursue Philip's story about the suspension and goes on to speak to many of the adults involved in the incident: the school superintendent; Dr. Albert Seymour, the principal; Dr. Gertrude Doane, the assistant principal; Dr. Joseph Palleni, and Ms. Narwin. Ms. Stewart's slanted newspaper article quickly garners national attention when it is picked up by the Associated Press. Philip and his \"anthem singing\" controversy are soon elevated into the national spotlight; leading many to laud him for his patriotism and condemn the school's (alleged) attempts to stymie it. Meanwhile, Harrison School District faces a critical school board election bearing significant implications over the school's future. With funding already in shortage, there is an urgent concern that the school could suffer greatly from further budget cuts. In the midst of the controversy, Miss. Narwin is asked to take a break from teaching, and she reluctantly agrees. This is soon followed by her resignation and she leaves to visit her sister in Florida. After using Philip's story as a platform, Ted Griffen is elected to the Harrison School district school board. At this post, he declines to extend much needed funding to Harrison High school in a demonstration of disapproval for their handling of the incident. When Philip returns to school, he has trouble adjusting to his dubious notoriety and becomes an outcast. His role in the dismissal of Ms. Narwin and his invitation of a media firestorm on the Harrison community fuel feelings of resentment toward him from his peers. He is harassed by other students both on the bus and in the classroom while his crush, Allison, openly resents him for the removal of her favorite teacher (Ms. Narwin). Matters decline further as Philip is informed by a friend that the student body has begun drafting a petition with the intention to compell him into revealing the truth about the incident (an idea that originated from the track coach, Coach Jamison.) This propels Philip into a breaking point and he begins skipping school, causing concern from his parents. Philip's mother ultimately decides to transfer him to a private school called Washington Academy (this despite protests from his father, as the move would take up all of Philips money saved for college). At Philip's new school, he is urged to demonstrate his patriotism by singing along to \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" At that moment, he starts to cry and admits, \"I don't know the words.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "SLX4 (also known as BTBD12 and FANCP) is a protein involved in DNA repair, where it has important roles in the final steps of homologous recombination. Mutations in the gene are associated with the disease Fanconi anemia.\nThe version of SLX4 present in humans and other mammals acts as a sort of scaffold upon which other proteins form several different multiprotein complexes. The SLX1-SLX4 complex acts as a Holliday junction resolvase. As such, the complex cleaves the links between two homologous chromosomes that form during homologous recombination. This allows the two linked chromosomes to resolve into two unconnected double-strand DNA molecules. SLX4 also associates with RAD1, RAD10 and SAW1 in the single-strand annealing pathway of homologous recombination. The DNA repair function of SLX4 is involved in sensitivity to proton beam radiation.\n\n\n== Model organisms ==\nModel organisms have been prominent in the study of SLX4 function. It was identified in 2001 during a screen for lethal mutations in yeast cells lacking a functional copy of the Sgs1 protein. Based on that, SLX4 was grouped with several other proteins produced by SLX (synthetic lethal of unknown function) genes.\nA conditional knockout mouse line, called Slx4tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program, a high-throughput mutagenesis project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists.\nMale and female animals underwent a standardized phenotypic screen to determine the effects of deletion. Twenty four tests were carried out on mutant mice and ten significant abnormalities were observed. A viability at weaning study found less homozygous mutant animals were present than predicted by Mendelian ratio. Homozygous mutant animals of both sexes were sub-fertile and homozygous females had a reduced body weight, body length, heart weight, platelet count and lean mass. Homozygotes of both sex had abnormal eye sizes, narrow eye openings, skeletal defects (including scoliosis and fusion of vertebrae), and displayed an increase in DNA instability as shown by a micronucleus test. This and further analysis revealed the mouse phenotype to model the human genetic illness, Fanconi anemia. The association was confirmed when patients with the disease were found to have mutations in their SLX4 gene.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The 2015 Giro d'Italia began on 9 May, and stage 11 occurred on 20 May. The race began with a team time trial from San Lorenzo al Mare to Sanremo.\n\n\n== Stage 1 ==\n9 May 2015 \u2014 San Lorenzo al Mare to Sanremo, 17.6 km (10.9 mi), team time trial (TTT)\n\nThe 2015 Giro started with a team time trial in Liguria, a feature included every year since the 2006 Giro. The course was flat, but almost entirely along the Riviera del Flori cycle path. It concluded on the Lungomare Italo Calvino in Sanremo, finish to the Milan\u2013San Remo race between 2008 and 2014. Team Sky were believed to be the favourites, having won the 2015 Tour de Romandie team time trial a week before the race started, along with Orica\u2013GreenEDGE, the winners of last year's team time trial in Belfast who desired a win in the TTT by including multiple time-trial specialists in their lineup.\nLampre\u2013Merida were the first team to start, with teams starting after every five minutes. They recorded a time of 20' 25\" but their time was only good enough for the second slowest time on the stage. Their time was shortly bettered by AG2R La Mondiale, who were 11 seconds faster. The first competitive time was set by Astana. The Kazach team set a time of 19' 39\" which was good enough to hold the lead for an hour. Some of the favourites for the stage like Team Sky, Etixx\u2013Quick-Step and BMC Racing Team set competitive times but they couldn't knock Astana off the hot seat. Eventually, only two teams were able to beat Astana's time. The first team to beat their time was Orica\u2013GreenEDGE. They stopped the clock in 19' 26\", a time which was good enough for the stage-winning time. The only team to go closer to Orica's time was Tinkoff\u2013Saxo, who were the fastest at the 9.9 km (6.2 mi) checkpoint. However they faded in the second half of the course, handing Orica the win. Simon Gerrans was first over the line, making him the first leader, although he claimed later that he wouldn't keep it for long, and that Michael Matthews would probably take it in the sprint the next day.\nAs for the GC contenders, Alberto Contador of Tinkoff-Saxo was the best-placed rider as he was only 7 seconds off the lead. His advantage over Fabio Aru of Astana was 6 seconds and his advantage over Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n of Etixx-Quick Step was 12 seconds. Richie Porte of Team Sky suffered the most as he lost 20 seconds to Contador and he lost significant time to other GC contenders.\n\n\n== Stage 2 ==\n10 May 2015 \u2014 Albenga to Genoa, 177 km (110.0 mi)\n\nThe first road stage was also held along the Ligurian coast. On the parcours of 177 km, there were two intermediate sprints, in Savona and Varazze, along with a fourth category climb of the Pratozanino, but other than that, there were only one other ascent that ended still with more than 120 km to go. As a result, it was still expected to result in a sprint in Genoa, where two laps of a 9.5 km (5.9 mi) circuit were completed, to complete the day's running.\nThe day's breakaway was formed by five riders, consisting of Androni Giocattoli\u2013Sidermec's Marco Frapporti, CCC\u2013Sprandi\u2013Polkowice's \u0141ukasz Owsian, Eugert Zhupa of Southeast Pro Cycling, Giacomo Berlato of Nippo\u2013Vini Fantini and Bert-Jan Lindeman representing LottoNL\u2013Jumbo. They managed to obtain a lead over the peloton of nine minutes, however, it was then that the peloton, led by Orica\u2013GreenEDGE started pursuit to ensure that their riders would keep the pink jersey. En route, Frapporti took maximum points at both sprints ahead of the mountain sprint.\nOwsian soon attacked for the mountain sprint, however, Lindeman countered from his wheel and took maximum points, granting him the blue jersey. At this point, the five were about three minutes ahead of the peloton. Tinkoff\u2013Saxo soon worked hard to bring the field back together and the breakaway was finally concluded when Owsian, the last surviving breakaway rider, was caught with 11 km (6.8 mi) to go. Several crashes took down some sprinters and domestiques but the biggest time loss was suffered by Domenico Pozzovivo as he was caught behind the crashes. Pozzovivo lost 1' 09\" in the process. Andr\u00e9 Greipel was the first to sprint for the win but he was overtaken by Moreno Hofland, who in turn was overtaken by Elia Viviani of Team Sky. The Italian rider ultimately beat Hofland to the sprint by about a wheel, granting him the red jersey. Finishing 7th on the stage as the highest placed Orica\u2013GreenEDGE rider, Michael Matthews took the maglia rosa although he didn't pick up any time bonuses and was still tied on time with Simon Gerrans, Simon Clarke and Esteban Chaves. He also took the white jersey as the best young rider.\n\n\n== Stage 3 ==\n11 May 2015 \u2014 Rapallo to Sestri Levante, 136 km (84.5 mi)\n\nThe first medium-mountain stage was held in the Cinque Terre area. The course was relatively short, but included two climbs - the third-category Colle Caprille and the second category Barbagelata, the summit of which came with 52 km (32.3 mi) to go. It had a long descent, which concluded 25 km (15.5 mi) ahead of the finish in Sestri Levante. There were also two intermediate sprints, in Torriglia and in Montebruno. Pre-race analysis suggested that the stage would either be won by a breakaway, or an attack on the second category climb.\nThe day's breakaway was formed by 25 riders. The best placed man in the breakaway was Simon Clarke and Esteban Chaves of Orica\u2013GreenEDGE as they were at the same time as maglia rosa wearer Michael Matthews before the beginning of the stage. Tinkoff\u2013Saxo would set a hard tempo in the peloton and the breakaway was only allowed to have a maximum lead of around 3 minutes before the peloton chipped into the lead. During the climbs at the middle of the course, several sprinters fell back off the peloton. During the climb of the second category Barbagelata, the breakaway was reduced to around a dozen riders before Pavel Kochetkov of Team Katusha jumped out of the saddle to take maximum points at the summit of the climb, ensuring he would take the blue jersey.\nDuring the descent, Domenico Pozzovivo crashed out of the race and he was taken to a hospital. Italian television report that Pozzovivo was moving and breathing for himself when he was taken away in the ambulance. He was bleeding from wounds to his face. As the stage wore on, Adam Hansen, on his 34th birthday, attacked out of the breakaway and he was joined by Maciej Paterski and Simon Clarke. They caught Kochetkov with around 10 kilometers left but the peloton caught them with around 3 kilometers to go. In the mass sprint, Fabio Felline sprinted for the win but it was Michael Matthews, the maglia rosa wearer, who passed him with 150 meters to go to take the stage win. As a result of the time bonuses, he extended his general classification lead to 6 seconds over Clarke.\n\n\n== Stage 4 ==\n12 May 2015 \u2014 Chiavari to La Spezia, 150 km (93.2 mi)\n\nThe second of three consecutive medium mountain stages took the riders on a short and technical course. The stage featured a series of climbs - the third category Colla di Velva, the uncategorized Passo del Bracco, the third category Passo del Termine and the third category ascent of Biassa. After passing through the finish line for the first time, the riders took a lap on a 17.1 km (10.6 mi) circuit where they tackled the ascent of Biassa before taking on the 10 km (6.2 mi) descent and flat ride to the finish. The finish at La Spezia was last featured in 1989 when Laurent Fignon won the stage en route to winning the Giro.\nFor the second successive day, the breakaway featured a huge amount of riders as 30 riders joined the break. The biggest surprise from the breakaway was Roman Kreuziger of Tinkoff\u2013Saxo, one of Alberto Contador's main lieutenants in the mountains. Despite Kreuziger's presence, the breakaway was allowed to establish a lead of around 10 minutes. Astana soon dictated the pace on the ascent of Passo del Termine and their pace decimated the peloton. Several riders fell off the back of the peloton including the maglia rosa wearer Michael Matthews. Astana's pace was able to reduce the peloton to only around 20 riders and the breakaway's advantage continually decreased as the stage wore on.\nAs the final climb to Biassa was approaching, Davide Formolo made his move for Cannondale\u2013Garmin, whose GC hopes was dashed when Ryder Hesjedal was distanced on the climb of Passo del Termine. Giovanni Visconti and Ama\u00ebl Moinard tried to follow his move but Formolo continued to increase his advantage. On the climb of Biassa itself, the first GC attack was made when Fabio Aru accelerated. He was followed by Contador and Richie Porte while Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n found himself unable to follow their pace. The trio of GC contenders were able to catch the remnants of the breakaway while Formolo continued to stay out front. Visconti and Moinard eventually failed in their bid to catch Formolo as the chase group caught them. Formolo eventually soloed to his first professional win by 22 seconds ahead of the remaining breakaway riders plus the trio of GC contenders. Aru tried to sprint for bonus seconds but it was Simon Clarke and Jonathan Monsalve who took the remaining time bonuses. Clarke celebrated as he crossed the finish line, unaware that Formolo already won the stage, before Visconti pointed out that Formolo was the stage winner. Clarke later clarified that his jubilation was for having continued his team's dominance at the Giro. Clarke, however, took the maglia rosa as the new leader of the general classification.\n\n\n== Stage 5 ==\n13 May 2015 \u2014 La Spezia to Abetone, 152 km (94.4 mi)\n\nAfter four tough stages, the race headed to its first mountain finish. The stage was expected to be the first showdown between the main contenders as they battled it out for time gaps in the general classification. Before undertaking the final climb, the riders tackled the 10 km (6.2 mi) climb of Foce Carpinelli first 47.5 km (29.5 mi) into the stage. Following the descent, the course gradually went uphill with around 40 km (24.9 mi) left before the climb of Abetone officially starts 17.3 km (10.7 mi) from the finish. The early segment of the climb averaged only 2.8 per cent before the riders undertook the most difficult section of the climb which averaged 7.2 per cent. The finishing kilometers approaching the summit eased up a bit, averaging 4.7 per cent.\nNo riders were able to break clear until after 16 km (9.9 mi) when the day's breakaway was finally formed, consisting of AG2R La Mondiale's Axel Domont, Androni Giocattoli\u2013Sidermec's Serghei \u021avetcov, BMC Racing Team's Silvan Dillier, IAM Cycling's Sylvain Chavanel and Lampre\u2013Merida's Jan Polanc. The peloton let their advantage go up to around 11 minutes before Orica\u2013GreenEDGE led the chase. As the stage wore on, it became more likely that the breakaway could survive to the end. The breakaway continued to work together and by the time they started the climb of Abetone, they had an advantage of 5' 33\" over the peloton. Chavanel was the first to attack in the breakaway but he was chased down by his fellow breakaway companions. Tvetcov was eventually gapped by Chavanel's attack.\nChavanel tried to attack again but the strongest from the remaining breakaway riders was Polanc, who gradually built a gap. Chavanel tried to chase him but Polanc increased his advantage. From behind, Diego Rosa was the first to attack and he was chased by Ivan Basso. After both were caught, Stefano Pirazzi and Mikel Landa had a go but neither rider could build a substantial gap and both were eventually caught. At this point, maglia rosa wearer Simon Clarke was dropped. Just as the peloton rode through the most difficult section of the climb, Alberto Contador attacked and only Fabio Aru and Richie Porte could follow him. Another GC contender, Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n, could not follow the trio as he would lose 28 seconds by the stage's end. Porte and Aru traded attacks but each time, the attacks would be nullified. Landa would join the elite group of riders, forming a quartet of chasers. Back at the front, Polanc gradually built his advantage before soloing to the stage win. Contador, Porte, Aru and Landa caught every remnant of the breakaway before the trio of contenders tried to sprint for bonus seconds, dropping Landa in the process. Chavanel was caught shortly before the finish but he hung on for second 1' 31\" back with Aru outsprinting Contador and Porte to take the 4-second time bonus for third place. The peloton finished the stage scattered behind and as a result, Contador became the new maglia rosa wearer with Aru in second, only 2 seconds behind him and Porte in third, a further 18 seconds back.\n\n\n== Stage 6 ==\n14 May 2015 \u2014 Montecatini Terme to Castiglione della Pescaia, 183 km (113.7 mi)\n\nAfter three successive tough stages, the race headed from Montecatini Terme to Castiglione della Pescaia in a day for the sprinters. The stage was mostly flat except for the middle sector where the short fourth category climb of Pomarance was found. The middle sector was undulating, featuring short climbs, before the riders tackled a long descent and a final flat stretch to the finish.\nTwo breakaways were formed at different times. The first riders to attack were CCC\u2013Sprandi\u2013Polkowice's Marek Rutkiewicz and Nippo\u2013Vini Fantini's Eduard Grosu, attacking after 2 kilometers had passed before Androni Giocattoli\u2013Sidermec's Marco Bandiera, Nippo\u2013Vini Fantini's Alessandro Malaguti and Cannondale\u2013Garmin's Alan Marangoni joined them after 20 kilometers. Tinkoff\u2013Saxo had hoped the someone in the break could take Alberto Contador's pink jersey but the sprinters' teams, namely Lotto\u2013Soudal, IAM Cycling, Trek Factory Racing and Team Giant\u2013Alpecin, worked hard to keep the break under control. The breakaway's lead maxed at around five minutes before it started to go down to around three minutes at the final intermediate sprint. At this point, news of headwinds and side winds broke out and as a result of the winds, the breakaway's lead quickly went down and with 14 kilometers left in the stage, all riders were together again.\nSoon, the teams of the GC contenders, namely Tinkoff\u2013Saxo, Astana and Team Sky, worked at the front to keep their team leaders out of trouble. As the peloton passed the 3-kilometer banner, the sprinters' teams went at the front to build their lead-out trains. In the finishing sprint, a crash took down several riders, including Contador. The crash was caused by Italy's Daniele Colli colliding with a spectator's camera lens, causing Colli to suffer a broken arm. As the chaos scattered behind, Greg Henderson perfectly led out Andr\u00e9 Greipel as Greipel took the stage win, his third at the Giro. With the win, Greipel took the red jersey to lead the points classification. With the crash happening inside the final 3 kilometers, the GC remained unchanged but Contador's challenge for the Giro was put in doubt after X-rays discovered that Contador dislocated his left shoulder in the crash. His injury prevented him from putting on the pink jersey during the podium presentations. Nonetheless, Contador stated that he would try to continue riding the Giro despite the injury.\n\n\n== Stage 7 ==\n15 May 2015 \u2014 Grosseto to Fiuggi, 264 km (164.0 mi)\n\nAt 264 kilometers long, the course features the longest stage of the Giro d'Italia since 2000. The route only features one categorized climb - the fourth category Monterotondo. Despite that, there are other uncategorized climb during the course which will make it difficult for the pure sprinters to survive for a final sprint. The stage is expected to be won by a puncheur or a rouleur.\nDespite suffering a shoulder injury, Alberto Contador was able to start the stage. The day's break was formed by four riders, consisting of Androni Giocattoli\u2013Sidermec's Marco Bandiera, Bardiani\u2013CSF's Nicola Boem, Nippo\u2013Vini Fantini's Pierpaolo De Negri and CCC\u2013Sprandi\u2013Polkowice's Nikolay Mihaylov. The peloton let them have an advantage of around 10 minutes with Tinkoff\u2013Saxo controlling the chase and protecting Contador. Due to a strong headwind, the peloton's pace averaged only around 35 km/h. Bandiera won took maximum points at the intermediate sprint, after which he pulled out a piece of paper to wish his father a \"happy birthday\". The break's advantage eventually began to fall quickly after BMC Racing Team hit the front of the peloton.\nBandiera once again took maximum points at the second intermediate sprint but the break was caught with 21 kilometers left. Tinkoff-Saxo, once again, kept station at the front to protect Contador from any danger. Several sprinters fell off the back once the peloton reached the final stretch of the stage. Yesterday's stage winner, Andr\u00e9 Greipel, tried to stay with the peloton but he also fell off the back. Michael Matthews sacrificed his chances for Simon Gerrans but they were not well-placed for the sprint. Eventually, it was Diego Ulissi who came to the front. No one was able to match his speed as he won his first stage since his nine-month suspension. Contador and the other GC favourites finished safely within the peloton and as a result, Contador kept the maglia rosa.\n\n\n== Stage 8 ==\n16 May 2015 \u2014 Fiuggi to Campitello Matese, 186 km (115.6 mi)\n\nThe stage featured the second summit finish of the race. The riders did tackle two climbs on the course - the second category Forca d'Acero and the first category Campitello Matese. The climb of Forca d'Acero was around 29 kilometers long and topped at just around 106 kilometers to the finish. The ascent of Campitello Matese was 13.6 kilometers and featured an average gradient of 6.5 per cent. The latter climb was expected to feature another showdown between the main GC contenders. The stage also featured the first main test for Alberto Contador's left shoulder after his crash two days earlier.\nThe first kilometers of the stage featured some riders trying to break clear of the peloton but each time, the peloton would catch them. At one point during the stage, the peloton split and maglia rosa wearer, Contador, found himself in a second group at one minute behind the other main GC contenders. However, the second group managed to bridge over the gap and Contador was even able to increase his lead over Aru in the GC to 4 seconds after he took time bonuses in the intermediate sprint. At this point, Steven Kruijswijk of LottoNL\u2013Jumbo attacked and he was chased by ten riders as the peloton eased up the pace. Kruijswijk was able to build an advantage but he was chased by AG2R La Mondiale's Carlos Betancur, Androni Giocattoli\u2013Sidermec's Franco Pellizotti and Trek Factory Racing's Kristof Vandewalle. The peloton let the quartet build an advantage of around 9 minutes and soon, Pellizotti was dropped to the chasing group. The peloton slowly decreased their advantage with Astana setting a very fast pace.\nOn the lower slopes of the climb, Betancur tried to go solo but Kruijswijk responded with a counter-attack that dropped Betancur. From behind in the chasing group, S\u00e9bastien Reichenbach and Be\u00f1at Intxausti attacked to catch Kruijswijk. They passed Kruijswijk with around 4 kilometers to go. From behind in the peloton, Fabio Aru attacked. At first, only his teammate, Mikel Landa was able to follow him but Contador, Richie Porte, Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n and others were able to chase them. Landa eventually went in pursuit of the stage win and after some time, Damiano Cunego attacked as well. Aru and Porte tried to throw in more attacks but Contador and Uran would be able to follow them. Up front, Reichenbach seemed to put Intxausti in difficulty when Intxausti attacked for the win. He would not be caught as he took another Giro stage win. Landa went across the line 20 seconds behind in second while Reichenbach finished in third place, 11 seconds further back. The four main GC favourites, along with Dario Cataldo, finished together as Contador stays in pink.\n\n\n== Stage 9 ==\n17 May 2015 \u2014 Benevento to San Giorgio del Sannio, 224 km (139.2 mi)\n\nAfter a hard day in the mountains, the riders are set to face around 4,000 meters of vertical climbing during the stage. The route features 3 climbs - the second category Monte Terminio, the first category Colle Molella and the second category Passo Serra. The first ascent to Monte Terminio is expected to possibly take out the non-climbers while the crucial portion of the stage is expected to be the ascent of Passo Serra, which tops at just around 12 kilometers to the finish.\nThe whole group of riders stayed together until the 52-kilometer mark when 11 riders broke clear to form the day's breakaway. In terms of the GC, the best-placed men in the breakaway were Ama\u00ebl Moinard, who was at 4' 45\" back in the GC, and Ryder Hesjedal, who was at 6' 49\" back of the pink jersey of Alberto Contador. The peloton allowed the gap to reach 5' 53\" at the top of the climb of Monte Terminio, at which point Moinard was the virtual maglia rosa. On the descent, S\u00e9rgio Paulinho attacked from the peloton but he was unable to keep his lead and soon, he dropped back to the peloton. Up front, Simon Geschke took the first two KOM sprints to take the blue jersey and on the descent of Colle Molella, Dario Cataldo of Astana attacked from the peloton but Tinkoff\u2013Saxo brought him back. Soon, Tom-Jelte Slagter attacked the lead group and he was able to build a gap, taking the second intermediate sprint in the process.\nOn the descent, a motorcycle crashed on a sharp curve, causing the peloton to slow down in the process. With 50 kilometers to go, the advantage of Slagter over the peloton was increased to nearly 6 minutes. In the chasing group, Paolo Tiralongo and Jes\u00fas Herrada attacked but they were brought back. Kenny Elissonde was next to attack and he was chased by Tiralongo but they were brought back as well. Tiralongo attacked again on the ascent of Passo Serra and this time, he was able to pull away. Back in the peloton, Tinkoff-Saxo picked up the pace to reduce Slagter's advantage. On the climb of Passo Serra, Fabio Aru attacked and he was quickly chased down by Contador, Richie Porte and Mikel Landa. Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n struggled once again as he was unable to follow the attacks. Back at the front, with 8.1 kilometers left, Tiralongo caught Slagter and after a while, Slagter was dropped and the Italian was soon on his own. From the remnants of the break, Steven Kruijswijk attacked in pursuit of Tiralongo but Tiralongo stayed out front, winning the stage solo. Kruijswijk was 21 seconds behind when he crossed the finish line in second and the remnants of the break finished 2\u20136 seconds further back. From the group of the maglia rosa, the four riders worked together to distance Uran further. As the elite group of favourites closed in on the finish, Aru sprinted to take some seconds and he was able to gain one second on Contador and Porte. Uran finished 46 seconds behind Contador and as a result, he fell to 2' 10\" behind Contador in the GC. Contador, meanwhile, saw his lead drop to 3 seconds over Aru as Contador stayed in pink ahead of the first rest day.\n\n\n== Stage 10 ==\n19 May 2015 \u2014 Civitanova Marche to Forl\u00ec, 200 km (124.3 mi)\n\nThe second week of the Giro started with an entirely flat stage that is expected to end in a bunch sprint. The riders are taken across the Adriatica coastal road and located in the middle of the stage is the fourth category climb of Monte di Bartolo which is only 4.8 kilometers long with an average gradient of 3.5 per cent. From there on, the stage is entirely flat until the finish in Forl\u00ec. The last time Forl\u00ec hosted a Giro stage finish was in 2006 when Robbie McEwen won the sixth stage in a bunch sprint.\nThe day's breakaway was formed by an all-Italian group, consisting of Bardiani\u2013CSF's Nicola Boem, Nippo\u2013Vini Fantini's Alessandro Malaguti, Southeast Pro Cycling's Matteo Busato, Cannondale\u2013Garmin's Alan Marangoni and Androni Giocattoli\u2013Sidermec's Oscar Gatto. The breakaway was able to establish a lead of around 5 minutes before the sprinters' teams began to chip into the lead. Despite the sprinters' teams' desire to catch the break, the five-man breakaway was not ready to give up as their gap hovered at around 2\u20133 minutes during the flat ride to the finish. Noticing that the peloton is not moving quick enough, BMC Racing Team and AG2R La Mondiale sent riders to attack but the break\u2019s lead remained relatively healthy.\nBack at the front, the five continued to work together but with around 13 kilometers remaining, Gatto suffered a mechanical, causing him to drop back to the peloton. With around 5 kilometers to go, the gap to the breakaway was only at a minute but with the breakaway helped by a tailwind, it seemed more and more likely that the breakaway would survive. As the break closed in on the finish line, Marangoni attacked for the stage win but he would be caught close to the finish. Eventually, it was Boem who outsprinted Busato for the stage win. With the stage win, Boem took the red jersey as leader of the points classification. Giacomo Nizzolo led the peloton across the line 18 seconds later as Alberto Contador kept the maglia rosa. However, one rider notably absent from the group was Richie Porte. Porte suffered a flat tire with around 7 kilometers to go and despite Team Sky\u2019s efforts to bridge the gap to the peloton, Porte lost 47 seconds on the day to drop him to fourth place in the GC. Later in the day, Porte\u2019s GC chances suffered a major blow when Porte was given a two-minute penalty for an illegal wheel change. Porte received a wheel change, not from his teammates, but from fellow Australian, Orica\u2013GreenEDGE\u2019s Simon Clarke. As a result, Porte dropped out of the top 10 and he was now 3' 09\" behind Contador in the GC.\n\n\n== Stage 11 ==\n20 May 2015 \u2014 Forl\u00ec to Imola (Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari), 153 km (95.1 mi)\n\nAfter an almost entirely flat stage, the riders tackle the hills for a lumpy ride. The route contains three categorized climbs - the third category Passo Del Trebio, the third category Valico Del Prugno and the fourth category Tre Monti, which is passed four times during the stage. However, the route also contains several uncategorized climbs. After passing the Valico Del Prugno, the riders enter the Imola racetrack. The finishing circuit of the stage is 15.4 kilometers long and the riders will tackle it three times. Each circuit contains the climb of Tre Monti but only the third passing of the climb is categorized.\nNo rider was able to break away until after the first intermediate sprint, 7.6 kilometers from the start. Giacomo Nizzolo won the intermediate sprint and shortly after the intermediate sprint, 10 riders slowly made their way into the break. GC-wise, the best-placed man in the breakaway is Ryder Hesjedal, who was 6' 16\" behind maglia rosa wearer Alberto Contador. The break was only allowed to build a gap of 3' 48\" before the peloton started the chase. Along the way, Luca Paolini and Carlos Betancur fell off their bikes but they did not suffer serious injuries and Betancur made it back into the break. With 45 kilometers to go and as the riders entered the finishing circuit, the break's lead was down to 57 seconds but the break began to build their lead again. With around 30 kilometers to go, Stefan K\u00fcng put in a dig from the peloton and though he tried to bridge the gap to the break, he was caught by the peloton shortly afterwards.\nBack up front, Ilnur Zakarin attacked with 22 kilometers to go as the break was closing in on the categorized climb of Tre Monti. He was able to continually increase his gap on the six remaining breakaway riders and he slowly built a gap of around 1 minute on his chasers. As the peloton continued to chase the break, Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n suffered a crash and though he was gapped by around 30 seconds, he was able to make it back to the peloton. Then, as the peloton closed in on the summit of the final ascent of Tre Monti, Contador surprised everyone with an attack. Fabio Aru tried to respond to his attack but Contador was able to build a short gap before being brought back shortly. On the final run-in, Maciej Paterski and Philippe Gilbert attacked out of the peloton but the duo were not able to catch the break. Meanwhile, Zakarin continued to have a steady advantage over his chasers as he eventually soloed across the finish line, 53 seconds ahead of his fellow breakaway riders. Paterski and Gilbert finished 58 seconds behind Zakarin while the peloton crossed the line 1' 02\" behind. All of the main GC riders finished safely within the peloton as Contador stayed in pink heading into the second half of the race.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The Fugitive Slave Clause of the United States Constitution, also known as either the Slave Clause or the Fugitives From Labor Clause, is Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3, which requires a \"person held to service or labour\" (usually a slave, apprentice, or indentured servant) who flees to another state to be returned to the owner in the state from which that person escaped. The passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery except as punishment for a crime, made the clause mostly moot.\n\n\n== Text ==\nThe text of the Fugitive Slave Clause is:\n\nNo person held to service or labour in one state, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labour, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due.\n\nAs in the other references in the Constitution dealing with slavery, the words \"slave\" and \"slavery\" are not specifically used in this clause. Historian Donald Fehrenbacher believes that throughout the Constitution there was the intent to make it clear that slavery existed only under state law, not federal law. On this instance, Fehrenbacher concludes:\n\nMost revealing in this respect was a last-minute change in the fugitive-clause whereby the phrase \"legally held to service or labor in one state\" was changed to read \"held to service or labor in one state, under the laws thereof.\" The revision made it impossible to infer from the passage that the Constitution itself legally sanctioned slavery.\n\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to the American Revolution, there were no generally accepted principles of international law that required sovereign states to return fugitive slaves that had fled to their territory. English court decisions and opinions came down on both sides of the issue.\nThe ambiguity was resolved with the 1772 decision in Somerset v Stewart case. Lord Mansfield ordered that a fugitive slave from Virginia who had reached England, where slavery was prohibited, was a free person who could not be legally returned to his previous owners. Absent a long-standing local custom or positive legislation requiring the return, judges were bound by English law to ignore the prior legal status of the fugitive under foreign laws. Although the decision did not affect the colonies directly and despite a general record of cooperation by northern colonies, law professor Steven Lubet wrote:\n\nNonetheless, the Somerset precedent was frightening to southern slaveholders. It had been widely published in America, and often over-interpreted as having completely abolished slavery under British law. News of the ruling had spread by word of mouth among slaves, which of course was troubling to their masters.\n\nDuring and after the American Revolutionary War under the Articles of Confederation, there was no ability to compel free states to capture fugitive slaves from other states and return them to their former masters, although there were provisions for the extradition of criminals. Despite this, there was not a widespread belief that this was a problem or that northern states failed to cooperate on the issue. This was due at least in part to the fact that by 1787 only Vermont and Massachusetts had outlawed or effectively outlawed slavery.\nAt the Constitutional Convention, many slavery issues were debated and for a time slavery was a major impediment to passage of the new constitution. However, there was little discussion concerning the issue of fugitive slaves. After the issues involving the slave trade and the counting of slaves for representation purposes regarding both the distribution of taxes and the apportionment of the members of the United States House of Representatives, two South Carolina delegates, Charles Pinckney and Pierce Butler, proposed that fugitive slaves should be \"delivered up like criminals\". James Wilson of Pennsylvania and Roger Sherman of Connecticut originally objected. Wilson argued that the provision \"would oblige the Executive of the State to do it at public expence\", while Sherman stated that he \"saw no more propriety in the public seizing and surrendering a slave or servant, than a horse\". After these objections, the discussion was dropped, but the very next day Butler proposed the language which was passed with no debate or objections.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 1864, during the Civil War, an effort to repeal this clause of the Constitution failed. The subsequent passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery, rendering the clause mostly moot.\nHowever, it has been noted in connection with the Fugitive Slave Clause that people can still be held to service or labor under limited circumstances; the U.S. Supreme Court stated in United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931, 943 (1988) that \"not all situations in which labor is compelled by physical coercion or force of law violate the Thirteenth Amendment\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nFugitive slave laws\nSlave Trade Acts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAmar, Akhil Reed.

He was the father of Kan\u014d Tan'y\u016b, one of the most prominent painters of the school.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nTakanobu was born in Kyoto on the 25th day of the 11th month of the 2nd year of Genki. He was the youngest son of the Kan\u014d school head painter Kan\u014d Eitoku (1543\u201390) and younger brother of Kan\u014d Mitsunobu.\nWhen Kan\u014d Naganobu (1577\u20131654)\u2014Eitoku's brother\u2014moved at the behest of the recently ascendent Tokugawa shogunate to its new administrative capital of Edo (modern Tokyo) around 1610\u201315, Takanobu remained in Kyoto, where the commissions he received indicate he was a favourite of the court. At the time only Takanobu and Naganobu had sufficient skill to head branches of the school.\nWith financial backing from the Tokugawa shogunate, Takanobu conceived and oversaw the painting to be done for the new palace of Emperor Go-Mizunoo, work which was finished in 1614 with Takanobu applying the final touches to many of the sliding panels there and in surrounding buildings. The twenty panels depicting thirty-two Chinese sages in the throne room of the shishin-den are attributed to Takanobu. These panels are some of the few works of Takanobu to have survived, and are the oldest surviving paintings from the shishin-den.\nIn 1617 Naganobu's eldest son Tan'y\u016b was called to Edo and made a goy\u014d eshi, an exclusive position painting for the shogunate. Another son, Kan\u014d Naonobu (1607\u201350), succeeded as head of the Kyoto branch upon Takanobu's death in 1618, though he too moved to Edo in 1630. The line continued under Mitsunobu's son Sadanobu, who died without an heir in 1623 but had adopted Takanobu's youngest son Yasunobu, who thus continued the Kyoto line until he also was made goy\u014d eshi and moved to Edo, though he maintained his claim as head of the Kyoto branch.\n\nWorks by Kan\u014d Takanobu\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kan\u014d Takanobu at Wikimedia Commons",

He is not afraid to speak his mind and allowed his listeners to do the same during his former afternoon phone-in show. Bill's last regular broadcast was on 24 April 2016.\nAmerican-born, Heine has lived in Oxford since studying for a postgraduate degree at Balliol College in the late 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, he ran both the Penultimate Picture Palace cinema in East Oxford and the Moulin Rouge Cinema (which he later renamed Not The Moulin Rouge) in Headington. He employed the sculptor John Buckley to design a giant pair of hands to adorn the former, and a giant pair of legs for the latter.\nHeine employed Buckley again in 1986 to design a 25 ft fibreglass sculpture of a shark that appears to be crashing through the roof of his own house in the Headington area of Oxford, creating a somewhat controversial local landmark.\nHeine's book about his radio career, Heinstein of the Airwaves, was published by Chris Andrews Publications on 31 October 2008, and his book about his infamous sculpture, The Hunting of the Shark, was published by Oxfordfolio on 9 August 2011.\nIn November 2017 Heine revealed that he had been diagnosed with terminal acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBill Heine on Twitter \nBBC My Story with Bill Heine on YouTube\nInterview with Bill Heine\nThe Headington Shark",

            "content": "Toxicodendron radicans, commonly known as eastern poison ivy or poison ivy, is a poisonous Asian and Eastern North American flowering plant that is well-known for causing Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash in most people who touch it. It is caused by urushiol, a clear liquid compound in the plant's sap. The species is variable in its appearance and habit, and despite its common name it is not a true ivy (Hedera), but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family (Anacardiaceae). Toxicodendron radicans is commonly eaten by many animals, and the seeds are consumed by birds, but poison ivy is most often thought of as an unwelcome weed.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThere are numerous subspecies and/or varieties of T. radicans, which can be found growing in any of the following forms; all of which have woody stems:\nas a climbing vine that grows on trees or some other support\nas a shrub up to 1.2 metres (3 ft 11 in) tall\nas a trailing vine that is 10\u201325 centimetres (3.9\u20139.8 in) tall\nSubspecies and varieties\nToxicodendron radicans subsp. eximum (Greene) Gillis\nToxicodendron radicans subsp. hispidum (Engl.) Gillis\nToxicodendron radicans subsp. negundo (Greene) Gillis\nToxicodendron radicans var. negundo (Greene) Reveal\nToxicodendron radicans var. pubens (Engelm. ex S. Watson) Reveal\nToxicodendron radicans subsp. radicans\nToxicodendron radicans var. radicans\nToxicodendron radicans subsp. rydbergii (Small ex Rydb.) \u00c1. L\u00f6ve & D. L\u00f6ve\nToxicodendron radicans var. rydbergii (Small ex Rydb.) Erskine\nToxicodendron radicans subsp. verrucosum (Scheele) Gillis\nThe deciduous leaves of T. radicans are trifoliate with three almond-shaped leaflets. Leaf color ranges from light green (usually the younger leaves) to dark green (mature leaves), turning bright red in fall; though other sources say leaves are reddish when expanding, turn green through maturity, then back to red, orange, or yellow in the fall. The leaflets of mature leaves are somewhat shiny. The leaflets are 3\u201312 cm (1.2\u20134.7 in) long, rarely up to 30 cm (12 in). Each leaflet has a few or no teeth along its edge, and the leaf surface is smooth. Leaflet clusters are alternate on the vine, and the plant has no thorns. Vines growing on the trunk of a tree become firmly attached through numerous aerial rootlets. The vines develop adventitious roots, or the plant can spread from rhizomes or root crowns. The milky sap of poison ivy darkens after exposure to the air.\nThe urushiol compound in poison ivy is not a defensive measure; rather, it helps the plant to retain water. It is frequently eaten by animals such as deer and bears.\nToxicodendron radicans spreads either vegetatively or sexually. It is dioecious; flowering occurs from May to July. The yellowish- or greenish-white flowers are typically inconspicuous and are located in clusters up to 8 cm (3.1 in) above the leaves. The berry-like fruit, a drupe, mature by August to November with a grayish-white colour. Fruits are a favorite winter food of some birds and other animals. Seeds are spread mainly by animals and remain viable after passing through the digestive tract.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nToxicodendron radicans grows throughout much of North America, including the Canadian Maritime provinces, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and all U.S. states east of the Rocky Mountains, as well as in the mountainous areas of Mexico up to around 1,500 m (4,900 ft). Caquistle or caxuistle is the Nahuatl term for the species. It is normally found in wooded areas, especially along edge areas where the tree line breaks and allows sunshine to filter through. It also grows in exposed rocky areas, open fields and disturbed areas.\nIt may grow as a forest understory plant, although it is only somewhat shade-tolerant. The plant is extremely common in suburban and exurban areas of New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeastern United States. The similar species T. diversilobum (western poison oak) and T. rydbergii (western poison ivy) are found in western North America.\nToxicodendron radicans rarely grows at altitudes above 1,500 m (4,900 ft), although the altitude limit varies in different locations. The plants can grow as a shrub up to about 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) tall, as a groundcover 10\u201325 cm (3.9\u20139.8 in) high, or as a climbing vine on various supports. Older vines on substantial supports send out lateral branches that may be mistaken for tree limbs at first glance.\nIt grows in a wide variety of soil types, and soil pH from 6.0 (acidic) to 7.9 (moderately alkaline). It is not particularly sensitive to soil moisture, although it does not grow in desert or arid conditions. It can grow in areas subject to seasonal flooding or brackish water.\nIt is more common now than when Europeans first arrived in North America. The development of real estate adjacent to wild, undeveloped land has engendered \"edge effects\", enabling poison ivy to form vast, lush colonies in these areas. It is listed as a noxious weed in the US states of Minnesota and Michigan and in the Canadian province of Ontario.\nOutside North America, T. radicans is also found in the temperate parts of Asia, in Japan, Taiwan, the Russian islands of Sakhalin and the Kuriles, and in parts of China.\nA 2006 study by researchers at the University of Georgia found that poison ivy is particularly sensitive to carbon dioxide levels, greatly benefiting from higher concentrations in the atmosphere. Higher carbon dioxide levels increase the rate of plant growth, as well as causing them to produce more unsaturated urushiol which causes stronger reactions in humans. Poison ivy's growth and potency has already doubled since the 1960s, and it could double again once carbon dioxide levels reach 560 ppm.\n\n\n== Health effects ==\n\nUrushiol-induced contact dermatitis is the allergic reaction caused by poison ivy. In extreme cases, a reaction can progress to anaphylaxis. Around 15% to 25% of people have no allergic reaction to urushiol, but most people will have a greater reaction with repeated or more concentrated exposure.\nOver 350,000 people are affected by poison ivy annually in the United States.\nThe pentadecylcatechols of the oleoresin within the sap of poison ivy and related plants causes the allergic reaction; the plants produce a mixture of pentadecylcatechols, which collectively is called urushiol. After injury, the sap leaks to the surface of the plant where the urushiol becomes a blackish lacquer after contact with oxygen.\nUrushiol binds to the skin on contact, where it causes severe itching that develops into reddish inflammation or non-coloured bumps, and then blistering. These lesions may be treated with Calamine lotion, Burow's solution compresses, dedicated commercial poison ivy itch creams, or baths to relieve discomfort, though recent studies have shown some traditional medicines to be ineffective. Over-the-counter products to ease itching\u2014or simply oatmeal baths and baking soda\u2014are now recommended by dermatologists for the treatment of poison ivy. A plant-based remedy cited to counter urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is jewelweed, and a jewelweed mash made from the living plant was effective in reducing poison ivy dermatitis, supporting ethnobotanical use, while jewelweed extracts had no positive effect in clinical studies. Others argue that prevention of lesions is easy if one practices effective washing, using plain soap, scrubbing with a washcloth, and rinsing three times within two to eight hours of exposure.\nThe oozing fluids released by scratching blisters do not spread the poison. The fluid in the blisters is produced by the body and it is not urushiol itself. The appearance of a spreading rash indicates that some areas received more of the poison and reacted sooner than other areas or that contamination is still occurring from contact with objects to which the original poison was spread. Those affected can unknowingly spread the urushiol inside the house, on phones, door knobs, couches, counters, desks, and so on, thus in fact repeatedly coming into contact with poison ivy and extending the length of time of the rash. If this has happened, wipe down the surfaces with bleach or a commercial urushiol removal agent. The blisters and oozing result from blood vessels that develop gaps and leak fluid through the skin; if the skin is cooled, the vessels constrict and leak less. If poison ivy is burned and the smoke then inhaled, this rash will appear on the lining of the lungs, causing extreme pain and possibly fatal respiratory difficulty. If poison ivy is eaten, the mucus lining of the mouth and digestive tract can be damaged. A poison ivy rash usually develops within a week of exposure and can last anywhere from one to four weeks, depending on severity and treatment. In rare cases, poison ivy reactions may require hospitalization.\nUrushiol oil can remain active for several years, so handling dead leaves or vines can cause a reaction. In addition, oil transferred from the plant to other objects (such as pet fur) can cause the rash if it comes into contact with the skin. Clothing, tools, and other objects that have been exposed to the oil should be washed to prevent further transmission.\nPeople who are sensitive to poison ivy can also experience a similar rash from mangoes. Mangoes are in the same family (Anacardiaceae) as poison ivy; the sap of the mango tree and skin of mangoes has a chemical compound similar to urushiol. A related allergenic compound is present in the raw shells of cashews. Similar reactions have been reported occasionally from contact with the related Fragrant Sumac (Rhus aromatica) and Japanese lacquer tree. These other plants are also in the Anacardiaceae family.\n\n\n=== Treatment ===\n\nImmediate washing with soap and cold water or rubbing alcohol may help prevent a reaction. Hot water should not be used, as it causes one's pores to open up and admit the oils from the plant. During a reaction, calamine lotion or diphenhydramine may help mitigate symptoms. Corticosteroids, either applied to the skin or taken by mouth, may be appropriate in extreme cases. An astringent containing aluminum acetate (such as Burow's solution) may also provide relief and soothe the uncomfortable symptoms of the rash.\n\"A wise old man told me that the water in a quench bucket (which is the bucket a blacksmith uses to cool iron rapidly by dunking the hot iron in it) was the best cure-all for poison ivy that he had ever used. When a friend came down with a bad case of poison ivy and told me that calamine lotion wasn't working, I shared the wise man's story. She promptly filled a plastic spray bottle with my dirty quench water and coated her arms and legs. A day later she returned to the shop wanting to sell the \"magic elixir\" to the public. The theory? Heavy concentrations of iron in the water accelerated the drying up of poison ivy blisters.\"\nBy using a detergent, the urushoil can be emulsified to break it down so that it can be washed away more easily. Adding sand or a gritty substance to the detergent, will exfoliate the skin, taking the emulsified oil with it. Mix the abrasive with a dish washing liquid such as Dawn, and rubbing it briskly over the effected areas for several minutes, will mix the urushoil into the detergent, allowing it to be flushed away.\n\n\n== Identification ==\nThe following four characteristics are sufficient to identify poison ivy in most situations: (a) clusters of three leaflets, (b) alternate leaf arrangement, (c) lack of thorns, and (d) each group of three leaflets grows on its own stem, which connects to the main vine.\nThe appearance of poison ivy can vary greatly between environments, and even within a large area. Identification by experienced people is often made difficult by leaf damage, the plant's leafless condition during winter, and unusual growth forms due to environmental or genetic factors.\nVarious mnemonic rhymes describe the characteristic appearance of poison ivy:\n\"Leaflets three; let it be\" is the best known and most useful cautionary rhyme. It applies to poison oak, as well as to poison ivy, but other, non-harmful plants have similar leaves.\n\"Hairy vine, no friend of mine.\"\n\"Berries white, run in fright\" and \"Berries white, danger in sight.\"\n\n\n=== Similar-looking plants ===\nVirgin's bower (Clematis virginiana) (also known as Devil's Darning Needles, Devil's Hair, Love Vine, Traveller's Joy, Virginia Virgin's Bower, Wild Hops, and Woodbine; syn. Clematis virginiana L. var. missouriensis (Rydb.) Palmer & Steyermark [1]) is a vine of the Ranunculaceae family native to the United States. This plant is a vine that can climb up to 10\u201320 ft tall. It grows on the edges of the woods, moist slopes, and fence rows and in thickets and streambanks. It produces white, fragrant flowers about an inch in diameter between July and September.\nBox-elder (Acer negundo) saplings have leaves that can look very similar to those of poison ivy, although the symmetry of the plant itself is very different. While box-elders often have five or seven leaflets, three leaflets are also common, especially on smaller saplings. The two can be differentiated by observing the placement of the leaves where the leaf stalk meets the main branch (where the three leaflets are attached). Poison ivy has alternate leaves, which means the three-leaflet leaves alternate along the main branch. The maple (which the box-elder is a species of) has opposite leaves; another leaf stalk directly on the opposite side is characteristic of box-elder.\nVirginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia) vines can look like poison ivy. The younger leaves can consist of three leaflets but have a few more serrations along the leaf edge, and the leaf surface is somewhat wrinkled. However, most Virginia creeper leaves have five leaflets. Virginia creeper and poison ivy very often grow together, even on the same tree. Even those who do not get an allergic reaction to poison ivy may be allergic to the oxalate crystals in Virginia creeper sap.\nWestern poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum) leaflets also come in threes on the end of a stem, but each leaflet is shaped somewhat like an oak leaf. Western poison oak grows only in the western United States and Canada, although many people will refer to poison ivy as poison oak. This is because poison ivy will grow in either the ivy-like form or the brushy oak-like form depending on the moisture and brightness of its environment. The ivy form likes shady areas with only a little sun, tends to climb the trunks of trees, and can spread rapidly along the ground.\nPoison sumac (Toxicodendron vernix) has compound leaves with 7\u201315 leaflets. Poison sumac never has only three leaflets.\nKudzu (Pueraria lobata) is a non-toxic edible vine that scrambles extensively over lower vegetation or grows high into trees. Kudzu is an invasive species in the southern United States. Like poison ivy, it has three leaflets, but the leaflets are bigger than those of poison ivy and are pubescent underneath with hairy margins.\nBlackberries and raspberries (Rubus spp.) can resemble poison ivy, with which they may share territory; however, blackberries and raspberries almost always have thorns on their stems, whereas poison ivy stems are smooth. Also, the three-leaflet pattern of some blackberry and raspberry leaves changes as the plant grows: Leaves produced later in the season have five leaflets rather than three. Blackberries and raspberries have many fine teeth along the leaf edge, the top surface of their leaves is very wrinkled where the veins are, and the bottom of the leaves is light minty-greenish white. Poison ivy is all green. The stem of poison ivy is brown and cylindrical, while blackberry and raspberry stems can be green, can be squared in cross-section, and can have prickles. Raspberries and blackberries are never truly vines; that is, they do not attach to trees to support their stems.\nThe thick vines of riverbank grape (Vitis riparia), with no rootlets visible, differ from the vines of poison ivy, which have so many rootlets that the stem going up a tree looks furry. Riverbank grape vines are purplish in colour, tend to hang away from their support trees, and have shreddy bark; poison ivy vines are brown, attached to their support trees, and do not have shreddy bark.\nFragrant sumac (Rhus aromatica) has a very similar appearance to poison ivy. While both species have three leaflets, the center leaflet of poison ivy is on a long stalk, while the center leaflet of fragrant sumac does not have an obvious stalk. When crushed, fragrant sumac leaves have a fragrance similar to citrus while poison ivy has little or no distinct fragrance. Fragrant sumac produces flowers before the leaves in the spring, while poison ivy produces flowers after the leaves emerge. Flowers and fruits of fragrant sumac are at the end of the stem, but occur along the middle of the stem of poison ivy. Fragrant sumac fruit ripens to a deep reddish color and is covered with tiny hairs while poison ivy fruit is smooth and ripens to a whitish color.\nHoptree (Ptelea trifoliata) has leaves that are remarkably similar. It is, however, a much larger plant so confusion is unlikely for any but the smallest specimens. The flowers and seeds are also easily distinguished from those of poison ivy.\n\n\n=== Similar allergenic plants ===\nToxicodendron rydbergii (Western poison ivy)\nSmodingium argutum (African poison ivy)\nToxicodendron pubescens (Poison oak \u2013 Eastern)\nToxicodendron diversilobum (Poison oak \u2013 Western)\nToxicodendron vernix (Poison sumac)\nGluta spp (Rengas tree)\nToxicodendron vernicifluum (Japanese lacquer tree)\nLithraea molleoides (Aruera - South America)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnacardiaceae in BoDD \u2013 Botanical Dermatology Database\nContact-Poisonous Plants of the World\nToxicodendron radicans images at bioimages. vanderbilt.edu\nPoison Oak at Wayne's Word\nPoison Ivy Plant and Rash Images, advice, plant identification\nPoison Ivy, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs\nCommon weeds of the northern United States and Canada: Western poison oak, poison ivy and poison sumac.

It was located on the west side of County Road 83, about 0.5 miles (0.80 km) south of its junction with County Road 205, southeast of Bald Knob. It was a single-story double-pen structure, built out of wood framing, and was finished with a side gable roof and board-and-batten siding. A porch extended across its front (eastern) facade, supported by simple square posts. The house was built about 1921, and was a well-preserved example of period vernacular architecture.\nThe house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. It has been listed as destroyed in the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program database.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Blackstone, formerly named Blacks and White, and Bellefonte, is a town in Nottoway County, Virginia, United States. The population was 3,675 at the 2000 census.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Blackstone Historic District, Butterwood Methodist Church and Butterwood Cemetery, Little Mountain Pictograph Site, Oakridge, and Schwartz Tavern are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThis town, under its former name, was a stop on the Southside Railroad in the mid-nineteenth Century. This became the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad in 1870 and then a line in the Norfolk and Western Railway and now the Norfolk Southern Railway. The town's grid street pattern was laid out in 1874, and the town incorporated in 1888. Its economy thrived as a location for dark leaf tobacco sales and shipment through its railroad station.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBlackstone is located at 37\u00b04\u203236\u2033N 78\u00b00\u20325\u2033W (37.076661, -78.001302).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 4.6 square miles (11.8 km\u00b2), of which, 4.5 square miles (11.7 km\u00b2) of it is land and 0.04 square miles (0.1 km\u00b2) of it (0.44%) is water.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 3,675 people, 1,430 households, and 886 families residing in the town. The population density was 811.8 people per square mile (313.2/km\u00b2). There were 1,581 housing units at an average density of 349.2 per square mile (134.8/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the town was 50.23% White, 46.39% African American, 0.03% Native American, 0.71% Asian, 1.88% from other races, and 0.76% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.39% of the population.\nThere were 1,430 households out of which 29.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 38.7% were married couples living together, 18.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 38.0% were non-families. 33.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 17.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.41 and the average family size was 3.06.\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 24.3% under the age of 18, 7.4% from 18 to 24, 25.4% from 25 to 44, 21.6% from 45 to 64, and 21.3% who were 65 years of age or older.

It was closed by the BRAC Commission in the 1990s and is now the headquarters for the Virginia National Guard. In May 2014 the U.S. Department of State selected Fort Pickett as the site of their Foreign Affairs Security Training Center, which will train 8,000 to 10,000 students a year, many of them diplomats. Details of the Center's construction are still being worked out. The 2-year Blackstone Female Institute / Blackstone College for Girls also operated in Blackstone for many years. The buildings and grounds are now owned by the Virginia Conference of the United Methodist Church, which uses it as the Virginia United Methodist Assembly Center (VUMAC), drawing 19,000 visitors a year, with $9 million in renovations planned. The Blackstone shopping district (including a Wal-Mart, medical center, and livestock market) attracts customers from a large 3-county rural area. The town recently received a Main Street designation from the state, and a $1 million downtown revitalization project started in 2008. In 2009 the town opened the $4 million James Harris medical center. The Town of Blackstone also has regional bus terminal that serves 11 counties. The oldest building in town is Schwartz Tavern, built in stages from 1790 to 1840, now used as a museum. Bevell's Hardware, a local business, displays a giant 58' by 20' (17.7 by 6.1 meter) model railroad layout that attracts thousands of visitors each year from Thanksgiving weekend (end of November) through mid-January. The Robert Thomas Carriage Museum, containing 28 restored, antique carriages, sleighs, and buggies, was also opened in 2007.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nActress Bea Arthur also attended Blackstone School for Girls and was active in their Drama program in 1933.\nBishop James Cannon, Jr., first President of Blackstone College, achieved fame as the leading prohibition advocate in the nation.\nBooker T.

It got its name from the fact that Clarksdale has been historically referred to as \"Ground Zero\" for the blues. It opened in May 2001 and is located right next to the Delta Blues Museum. With its mismatched chairs and fraying sofa on the porch, it has a d\u00e9cor described as \"manufactured authenticity.\" Blues fans in Clarksdale welcome it as a place where local musicians have a chance to work regularly.\nThe menu consists of traditional southern foods, and the restaurant has live blues music playing Wednesday through Saturday. Super Chikan and Bill \"Howl-n-Madd\" Perry, not to be confused with the deceased Bill Perry, are two of the most frequent and well-known performers. In addition to the food and music, there are seven upstairs apartments that can be rented out to customers who would like to live the blues experience 24 hours a day.\nGround Zero has appeared in many television shows and publications, including:\n60 Minutes\nStephen Fry in America (BBC Documentary)\nThe Mighty Mississippi\n\"The Story of God W/Morgan Freeman, S1/E3(Who is God)\" ([NatGeo])\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGround Zero homepage\nGary Vincent Productions\nMorgan Freeman on IMDB\nLuckett Tyner Law Firm\nResource Entertainment Group, LLC (Stovall)",

            "content": "Woodgate is an area in Leicester in Fosse Ward. It lies west of the River Soar and is an important entrance to the city leading on to Frog Island. A busy junction, its northern end lies at the intersection of Fosse Road North, Groby Road, Blackbird Road and Buckminster Road. To the south is the Rally Park, which was formerly the goods yard of the London Midland Railway, which was originally the Leicester to Swannington Railway built by Robert Stephenson in 1832. To the west is Fosse Road North. At its eastern end Woodgate terminates at the North Bridge over the old River Soar.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe name dates from the medieval period. It likely comes from the history of using this road to bring timber into the town from the nearby woodlands.\nThe majority of the housing dates from the beginning of the 20th century, and like Newfoundpool was developed mainly by local builder Orson Wright. Before that time the area north of Woodgate, known as St Leonard's, was the principal residential area, and had been so for many centuries. Woodgate was a Housing Action Area in the late 1980s, when many properties were refurbished by Leicester City Council, and it forms part of the current regeneration plans for the city.\nIn the past Woodgate had a significant number of active factories, including hosiery, dyeworks, an iron foundry, light engineering and biscuit manufacture. The area has suffered from industrial decline with the closure of The Premier Screw and Repetition factory with over 100 redundancies. The site has often been vandalised. The former pubs, \"The Friar Tuck\" and \"The Old Robin Hood\" have long been derelict and been the scenes of crime including a murder. The former Nabisco factory site, home to a few small businesses and local Labour party offices was demolished in April 2008. This is the site of a new Aldi supermarket opened in November 2008. Other local businesses lie down Storey Street. The gothic Victorian St Leonard's Parish Church was demolished in the early 1990s and was replaced with a Kwikfit service station. St Leonard's Vicarage went at much the same time and was replaced by a car showroom. Woodgate itself remains a busy local shopping street with a bank, butcher, florist, hairdressers, optician, accountant, bakery (amongst others), Indian and Portuguese restaurants, a Chinese takeaway and traditional fish and chip shop. Woodgate has a primary school based on Balfour Street, and is also served by another on Slater Street.\n\n\n== Sites ==\nThe area is in Fosse Ward for local government purposes and part of the Leicester West parliamentary constituency at Westminster, the local MP from May 2010 is Liz Kendall. Previous MPs were Patricia Hewitt, Greville Janner and his father Barnett Janner.\nThe Woodgate Resources Centre is used for local social gatherings: it was formerly a library.\nAlso near to Woodgate is the Woodgate Adventure Playground on the Rally Park which is used by local children for recreation. The former Midland railway line is now a cycle/foot path leading in the direction of Glenfield and Groby to the north, and towards Leicester city centre to the south.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWoodgate Residents Association",

            "content": "The Servant of God Mar\u00eda Rafaela de los Dolores y del Patrocinio, O.I.C., more commonly known as Sor Patrocinio (\"Sister Protection\" (of Mary)), also known as \"the nun of the wounds\" (San Clemente, Cuenca, 1811 - Guadalajara, 1891), was a Spanish nun of the Order of the Immaculate Conception. She was prominent in the Spanish social and political spheres in the second half of the 19th century through her influence over Queen Isabel II and the queen's husband, King Francisco de As\u00eds de Borb\u00f3n.\nSor Patrocinio's reported mystical experiences and supernatural phenomena have been a source of controversy, at the time and later. She was instrumental in the founding or reform of many monasteries of the Order in both Spain and France. The cause for her beatification is currently being studied by the Holy See.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSor Patrocinio was born Mar\u00eda Josefa de los Dolores Anastasia de Quiroga y Capopardo on 27 April 1811 in San Clemente de la Mancha, in the Province of Cuenca, on a farm called Venta del Pinar. Her parents, Diego de Quiroga y Valc\u00e1rcel and Dolores Capopardo y del Castillo, were members of the royal court in Madrid, who were fleeing the city due to the upheavals of the Spanish War of Independence then taking place, when her mother was overtaken by birth pangs and had to take shelter at the farm.\nOn the death of Quiroga's father, her impoverished family returned to Madrid. Her mother intended her to marry Salustiano Ol\u00f3zaga, then a young lawyer; but this plan was rejected by Mar\u00eda herself. The two would later meet again during her trial in 1835, and during her exile in France following the revolutionary events of 1868.\nIn 1826 Quiroga was sent to the monastery of the nuns of the Order of Santiago in Madrid, under the guidance of her aunt, the Marquesa of Santa Coloma for her education. On 19 January 1829, under the patronage of the Duchess of Benavente, she was admitted as a novice in the Conceptionist Monastery of Caballero de Gracia and received her religious name. That same year, while still a novice, she sustained a wound in the left side, which she understood to be a stigma. On 20 January 1830 she professed religious vows in the Order.\n\n\n== Further mystical experiences ==\nStarting early in 1830 Sor Patrocinio reported mystical visions, many of them with bodily symptoms. On 20 May - Ascension Day - wounds appeared in her hands and feet, resembling those inflicted by the crown of thorns. On 8 June, two days after Corpus Christi day, she fell into an ecstatic state and reported that the voice of Christ spoke to her from a wall hanging. Her wounds were characterised by the large amount of blood that issued from them. Her reputation spread and cloths stained with the blood of her wounds were in request as curative amulets. (Lea, 1907)\nWhen the death of King Fernando VII in 1833 was followed by the Carlist war, \"the clericals, who favoured Don Carlos, saw in her a useful instrument. She was made to prophesy the success of the Pretender (Don Carlos) and to furnish proof of the illegitimacy of the young Queen Isabel\". (Lea, 1907)\nIn November 1835 Sor Patrocinio was put on trial accused of imposture and of supporting the Carlist cause. The trial sought to establish the true origin of the wounds she then bore. Three medical experts, after examining the wounds, undertook to heal them. A later examination certified that the wounds were now completely scarred over. Under oath, the nun stated that during her novitiate the Capuchin friar, Ferm\u00edn S\u00e1nchez y Artesoro, had supplied her with \"a relic which, when applied to any part of the body, would cause a wound which would then have to kept open as the source of suffering and mortification as offerings to God as penitence for sins... showing no-one their cause, and if questioned she had to say that they had come to her supernaturally\". The nun's reputation had attracted alms and donations intended for the Order and its monasteries; this now appeared as motive for fraud. The Capuchin friar had left the kingdom and could not be found to give evidence, and the court regarded this as confirming his guilt. For his part, the advocate for the defense, Juan M. Gonz\u00e1lez y Acevedo, argued that the evidence presented \"was all lies, except the torment\" of his client, whose role was that of \"a victim, the more worthy of compassion in that she appeared condemned to a slow and painful death\".\nAfter the trial Sor Patrocinio was expelled from her monastery and kept in a private house, before being taken to the House of Penitents of St. Mary Magdalene. She was then sentenced to banishment from the vicinity of the Court. She spent two years in a monastery in Talavera de la Reina. There she started writing the text known as the Golden Book, originally called The Month of the Eternal Mary.\nSor Patrocinio's exile in Talavera began to affect her health. After petitioning the queen several times by letter, she was allowed to move to the monastery of her Order at Torrelaguna, near Madrid, where she lived for the next five years.\n\n\n== Return to Madrid ==\nOnce the regency of Queen Mar\u00eda Cristina had terminated and Isabel II had become queen in her own right, Sor Patrocinio was permitted to return to Madrid. She entered the monastery of La Latina, which belonged to her Order. In 1845 she moved to the Monastery of Jes\u00fas Nazareno, where she had charge of the novices. Her influence over the monarchs was increasing. \"... [S]he became the power behind the throne. Dr Argumosa, who had cured her stigmata, was persecuted and Alcaraz (sic), who had emerged from his hiding place, was made Bishop of Cuenca. In 1849 she was held to have forced Isabel to dismiss the Duke of Valencia (Narvaez) and his cabinet\".(Lea, 1907) Also in 1849 she was shot at, but not harmed. Soon after this she was chosen as abbess, a position that from then on she held at each of the monasteries to which she moved. Her moves against General Narv\u00e1ez led to her banishment to Badajoz, although Narv\u00e1ez soon pardoned her and permitted her return.\nIn regard to the relationship between Sor Patrocinio and Isabel II, the queen's daughter Princess Eulalia wrote: \"I often heard my mother talking about how Father Claret, her confessor and someone with a great deal of influence over her, and the nun Sor Patrocinio (...) had suggested an approach to Pope Pius IX asking for the new dogma to be promulgated. My mother, a very religious woman (...) arranged that other leading Catholics would also sign this and would act in other ways within the Papacy\". The dogma she mentions is that of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, which was promulgated on 8 December 1854. Thus Sor Patrocinio, through her social relations at the highest level, had come to exert a theological influence.\n\n\n== Further moves and foundations ==\nTo distance her from Madrid and from her perceived influence over the monarchs, in 1852 she was sent to Rome, where her claim to holiness would be examined. However, she became ill during the journey and did not reach Italy. The government then ordered her to move to the Monastery of Poor Clares in Toledo. Later she founded the first school for small girls from poor families, at the Monastery of Montserrat, in Madrid. Then Generals Narv\u00e1ez and Espartero came to power and sent her away to the Poor Clare Monastery of St. Catherine the Martyr in Baeza. The Archbishop of Toledo ordered her to move to a derelict monastery at Torrelavega to re-found it. Having accomplished this mission she embarked on the foundation of new monasteries, of which the first was at Aranjuez. Here she was again the target of an unsuccessful armed attack. Other monasteries followed, at La Granja de San Ildefonso, at San Lorenzo del Escorial and at Guadalajara. During this period it is claimed that she prophesied the martyrdom of the Franciscan friar, Nicanor Ascanio.\n\n\n== Final banishment, return and death ==\n\"Under her guidance, during the remainder of the reign of Isabel II, the camarilla practically ruled the kingdom and precipitated the revolution of 1868\" (Lea, 1907) which brought about the temporary fall of the Spanish monarchy. Cardinal Ciliria sent her to France so that she would not fall into the hands of the revolutionaries. There the nun continued her mission of foundation. She drew up the rule of a new Order for approval by the Bishop of Paris. When the monarchy was restored in 1874, Alfonso XII came to the throne and permitted her return to Spain. She continued with the work of foundation up to the last year of her life. She died in the convent of Carmen de Guadalajara in 1891. The process of beatification began in 1907 and there is still a movement to have her made a saint.\n\n\n== Works ==\nGolden Book (Sp.

            "content": "Ahmed Mater (born 1979, Tabuk, Saudi Arabia) is a Saudi artist and physician. His mediums are photography, calligraphy, painting, installation, performance and video. His work, which explores history, the narratives and aesthetics of Islamic culture, and addresses consumerism and transformation taking place in the region and its effects on geopolitics, has attracted an international audience. In 2003, he cofounded \"Edge of Arabia\", an independent arts initiative dedicated to promoting the appreciation of contemporary Arab art and culture, with a focus on Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nAhmed Mater was born in 1979 in Tabuk in the north west of Saudi Arabia on the Jordanian border. He is the first child of Mater Ahmed Al-Ziad, a sergeant in the Saudi Arabian Army, and Fatimah Hassan Abdullah Aseeri, a calligrapher and painter of traditional Aseeri houses. Ahmed has two brothers, Bandar and Mohamed, and four sisters, Aicha, Jawaher, Jamila and Reem.\nIn the 1990s Mater was given a studio space in Abha at the al-Meftaha artists' village.\nHe splits his time between the Saudi Arabian cities of Abha, Jeddah and Makkah.\nMater's wife, Arwa Alneami, is also an artist. Together they run pharan.studio \u2013 a salon, artists' studios and \"cultural mining project\" in Jeddah.\n\n\n== Work ==\nMater's work has been exhibited internationally and acquired by major international museums. Illuminations, acquired by The British Museum, is a series that combines explicit notes from his medical education with images of the Kaaba and a mosque, distributed as a collage around blue and black x-ray images. The work seems to ask the viewer if humanity is more than just the structure of the body.\nIn 2006, Mater mounted an installation titled The Yellow Cow products, a work that address ecological challenges of modern urbanized society. According to the artist, \"The cow with the yellow color was used as an expression of religious heritage.\"\nHis Desert of Pharan series features photographs and films gathered over five-years, documenting the changes taking place in Islam's holiest city. Mater considers the unprecedented redevelopment of the Masjid Al-Haram, including a multibillion-dollar complex of luxury hotels, malls and apartments.\nMagnetism is a black cuboid magnet surrounded by iron filings to represent Hajj, Muslim's annual pilgrimage which includes the circumambulation of the Kaaba.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSelected Solo Shows\n2001 Landing on the Earth's Surface, Al-Maseef Culture Club, Abha, KSA\n2003 X-Ray Project - 6th Saudi Malwan Contest Tour, Jeddah, Beirut, Sidon and Manama (Jun10 \u2013 Sept 25)\n2004 Standing in Front of You, King Khaled University, Abha, KSA.\n2004 Chewing (Mudgah), Almiftaha Arts Village, Abha, KSA.\n2004 The End - Al Meftaha Arts Village, Abha (Dec15 \u2013 Dec30)\n2006 Ahmed Mater Al Ziad Aseeri -Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, London (May 12)\n2006 Son of Aseer- Al Meftaha Arts Village, Abha (Oct10 \u2013 Oct30)\n2009 Illumination, Art Space, Dubai (Mar15-Apr 15)\n2010 Ahmed Mater, The Vinyl Factory Gallery, London (Oct 11 \u2013 Oct 31)\n2013 100 Found Objects, Sharjah Art Foundation, Sharjah, UAE\n2016 Symbolic Cities: The Work of Ahmed Mater, Smithsonian, Arthur M.

The suburb border stretches from the Fitzroy Gardens in the north, to the University of Tasmania apartments in the south, and up the Waterworks Valley to the west. Other nearby suburbs are South Hobart and Tolmans Hill. Dynnyrne is Tasmania's second most affluent suburb according to documents released by the Australian Taxation Office.\nThe suburb is named for Dynnyrne House in South Hobart, which was built by Robert William Murray (1777\u20131850) who claimed to be descended from Sir William Murray, 1st baronet of Dunearn in Scotland.\nMembers of the public had been invited to suggest names for the suburb in 1940. About eighty different suggestions were received and six of them were forwarded to the Post Office for consideration. Cooloola, Illawarra, Karinga, Telopea, Rosslyn and Pambula were all rejected on the basis that they exactly or closely duplicated names already used in Australia. Following further consultation with the Post Office, Dynnyrne was chosen, recalling the first house built in the area about one hundred years earlier. One of the Hobart City Council aldermen warned that people would have difficulty knowing how to spell Dynnyrne but the new name was adopted.\n\n\n== References ==",

The English translation of the name is Twenty-fifth of May, which is the date of Argentina's May Revolution in 1810.\nThe ship previously served in the Royal Navy as HMS Venerable and the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS Karel Doorman. She was deployed south during the Beagle Crisis in 1978 and in the first weeks of the Falklands War, where her aircraft were deployed against the Royal Navy task force, but spent the bulk of the war in port.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ship was built by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead, England during the Second World War for the Royal Navy. As a Colossus-class aircraft carrier, she was named HMS Venerable and saw service in the British Pacific Fleet. Venerable only served three years in the Royal Navy before being sold to the Netherlands as HNLMS Karel Doorman.\nAfter a boiler room fire, the carrier was rebuilt, and sold to Argentina. The Argentines already operated a carrier, ARA Independencia, also a former Royal Navy Colossus-class. After Independencia was decommissioned in 1970, Veinticinco de Mayo was the sole remaining carrier in the Argentine fleet. She could carry up to 24 aircraft.\nThe air group started with F9F Panthers and F9F Cougars jets and later these were replaced with A-4Q Skyhawks supported by S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare aircraft and Sikorsky Sea King helicopters.\nIn September 1969, during the voyage of the recently bought Veinticinco de Mayo from the Netherlands, Hawker Siddeley demonstrated their Harrier GR.1 on board the carrier for a possible sale to the Argentine Navy.\n\nDuring the 1970s the ship was refitted and updated several times, though in each case the duration of each repair period was never more than 3\u20135 months, allowing her to be available to deploy. Her last pre-Falklands refit occurred during 1981, when she received an update to her radar, arresting gear, steam catapult and (most noticeably) the forward edge of the port side angled deck was filled out via an enlarged sponson. These improvements would theoretically enable her to operate the Super Etendard strike aircraft purchased from France, but it was discovered during testing that the catapult had difficulties launching the aircraft type. Therefore, her strike airwing was limited to the A-4Q Skyhawks.\n\n\n=== Beagle Conflict ===\nSee Operation Soberania\n\nDuring the Operation Soberania Veinticinco de Mayo was planned to support the invasion of the Picton, Nueva and Lennox islands.\n\n\n=== Falklands War ===\nDuring the Falklands War (Spanish: Guerra de las Malvinas/Guerra del Atl\u00e1ntico Sur), Veinticinco de Mayo was used in support of the initial Argentine landings on the Falklands On the day of the invasion she waited with 1500 army soldiers outside Stanley harbour as first submarine and boat landed commandos secured landing areas and then Argentine marines made the main amphibious landing. Her aircraft were not used during the invasion. Later in defence of the occupation she was deployed in a task force north of the Falkland Islands, with ARA General Belgrano to the south. The British had assigned HMS Splendid (S106), a nuclear-powered submarine, to track down Veinticinco de Mayo and sink her if necessary. Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward, commanding the British Task Force from HMS Hermes stated in his book \"One Hundred Days\", that had Splendid located the carrier, he would have \"Recommended in the strongest possible terms to the Commander-in-Chief Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse that we take them both out this night\".\n\nAfter hostilities broke out on 1 May 1982, the Argentine carrier attempted to launch a wave of A-4Q Skyhawk jets against the Royal Navy Task Force after her S-2 Trackers detected the British fleet. What would have been the first battle between aircraft carriers since World War II did not take place, as light winds prevented the heavily loaded jets from being launched. After the British nuclear-powered submarine HMS Conqueror sank General Belgrano, Veinticinco de Mayo returned to port for safety. Splendid never tracked down the carrier. The naval A-4Q Skyhawks flew the rest of the war from the airbase in R\u00edo Grande, Tierra del Fuego, and had some success against the Royal Navy, sinking HMS Ardent. Three Skyhawks were shot down by Sea Harriers.\nIn 1983, Veinticinco de Mayo was modified to carry the new Dassault Super \u00c9tendard jetsVideo but soon after problems in her engines largely confined her to port; she was deemed more or less unseaworthy.\n\n\n=== Disposal ===\nThe Argentine Navy could not procure the funds for a modernisation and new engines, leading to decommissioning by 1997. By this time she had already been stripped of various major pieces of equipment that were used as spares for the Brazilian carrier NAeL Minas Gerais, another Colossus-class ship which had been heavily modified in the Netherlands. Finally in 2000, she was towed to Alang, India for scrapping.\nAlthough Minas Gerais was offered to the Argentine Navy as a replacement in 2000 she was rejected due to her poor condition and high restoration and maintenance costs. Argentine cooperation with Brazil has meant that the naval air wing has continued to operate from the deck of carrier NAe S\u00e3o Paulo during ARAEX exercises and/or touch-and-go landings on US Navy carriers when they are in transit within Argentine coastal waters during Gringo-Gaucho manoeuvres.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of aircraft carriers\nList of ships of the Argentine Navy\nVeinticinco de Mayo cruiser\nList of ship launches in 1943\nList of ship commissionings in 1969\nList of ship decommissionings in 1997\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nIreland, Bernard (2007).

            "content": "The Saxon Rebellion or Rebellion of the Saxons (German: Sachsenkrieg) refers to the struggle between the Salian dynasty ruling the Holy Roman Empire and the rebel Saxons during the reign of Henry IV. The conflict reached its climax in the period from summer 1073 until the end of 1075, in a rebellion that involved several clashes of arms.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nUndercurrents of discord between the Salian royal family and the Saxons already existed under Henry's father, Emperor Henry III. This may have been primarily due to his Rhenish Franconian origin as well as his numerous stays in the Imperial Palace of Goslar, which were associated with a disproportionately high economic burden on the surrounding population. With the accession of Henry IV in 1065 this conflict intensified, as Henry made demands on numerous Imperial domains (Reichsg\u00fcter) in the centre of the Saxon heartland around the Harz mountains\u2014especially the silver mines of Rammelsberg. To secure these estates he initiated a castle building programme, erecting numerous fortresses along the range, the most prominent being the Harzburg. This was perceived as a threat by the Saxons. In addition, these castles were staffed with ministeriales of Swabian origin, who frequently plundered the Saxon population to make up for their lack of income..\nIn 1070 the Saxon count Otto of Nordheim, Duke of Bavaria since 1061, had been accused by the ministerialis Egeno I of Konradsburg of planning an assault on the king's life. Otto was deposed and banned, nevertheless he gained support by the son of Billung duke, Ordulf of Saxony, the young Magnus. King Henry IV had both captured and arrested. While Otto was pardoned, Magnus remained in custody at the Harzburg and was not released even after his father's death in 1072, as he showed no intention of renouncing the Saxon ducal dignity.\n\n\n== Motives of the participants ==\nIn order to grasp the reason for the outbreak of the uprising, it is important to deal with the persons and parties involved. These were, in this instance, Emperor Henry IV, the Saxon nobility and the remaining imperial princes.\n\n\n=== Henry IV ===\nThe king had his own reasons, which were also based on the Coup of Kaiserswerth and which had far-reaching consequences. The period after the coup was used by the imperial princes to further extend their power base within the Empire, since there was de facto no overall ruler able to hinder them. Empress Agnes herself was too weak and had fallen into disgrace, and the young king was in the hands of Anno of Cologne. When Henry was dubbed a knight in 1065, he was able to counter these ensuing developments. However, the course of events should not be seen as a recuperation, since the loss of royal lands in the Harz region may be regarded as of low importance and therefore not an essential motive. These areas had already been a bone of contention under Henry III between the Salians and Saxony. The castles should rather to be seen as an expression of royal power, because Henry supported himself prominently through ministeriales who were dependent on his benevolence in order to free himself from the imperial princes. But this drew further displeasure from the princes.\n\n\n=== The Saxon nobility ===\nThe motives of the Saxon nobles are now obvious, as they were hugely affected by Henry's actions and were consequently outraged. They did not want to give up so easily the influence that they had built up during the absence of a ruler.. This independence, which the king himself tried to achieve, led to a competition with the king, which in turn led to dissatisfaction among the Saxon princes. Henry's endeavours led to the desire for a ruler who was easier to control and to the king being blamed by the Saxons for his abuse of official authority. There was also a conflict due to the so-called \"royal immediacy\", the regular presence of the king in certain parts of the Empire. This situation was possibly overdramatized; for the king stayed in other parts of the Empire without similar complications. Among the Saxon princes, a certain Otto of Northeim, in particular, found the king a serious thorn in his side due to his participation in the Coup of Kaiserswerth and his expansion of possessions in the Harz. Because of this dispute and the later loss of his estates, Otto takes a leading role in the insurrection during the course of the alleged murder plot against the king.\n\n\n=== The Imperial Princes ===\nThe quarrels surrounding the ministeriales had wider repercussions and continued even among the non-insurgents. The resulting fear of loss of power, resulted in the great princes of the Empire lending their passive support to the insurrection. For example, Rudolf of Swabia, Berthold of Carinthia and Welf IV dissociated themselves from the Emperor.\n\n\n== Beginning of the rebellion ==\nAccording to the chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld, the Saxon princes came to the Imperial Palace of Goslar on 29 June 1073 in order to point to these abuses and demand improvements. Henry IV refused to enter discussions and then fled from the large, advancing Saxon army to the nearby castle of Harzburg, where he was besieged by the Saxon rebels, again led by Count Otto of Nordheim together with Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt. The king, however, was able to escape on the night of 10 August 1073, allegedly through the castle's well shaft. Henry fled across the Harz mountains reaching the Landgraviate of Thuringia at Eschwege first and then moved on to Franconian Hersfeld further into southern Germany. But he found hardly any support among the princes of the Empire, who were not willing to go to battle with him against the Saxons.\nAs a result, on 27 January 1074, Henry stood at the head of what was only a small army compared to the much larger Saxon one at Hersfeld. Both sides were afraid to join in battle, but for different reasons. Henry probably because of his obvious inferiority. The Saxon leaders, by contrast, were aware that a victory by their army, consisting mainly of peasants, would have strengthened the position of the latter, something they were not in favour of. So it happened that on 2 February 1074 peace negotiations in Gerstungen took place, which resulted in a settlement between the warring parties. The main outcome was that Henry IV agreed to the slighting of his castles on the edge of the Harz.\nHenry's accession to the demolition of his Harz castles included the Harzburg, which included a collegiate church and a family grave containing Henry's dead son and brother. To protect the royal burial ground, Henry directed that only the towers and walls of the Harzburg would be removed. This enraged the surrounding rural population who, in March 1074, razed the castle and its church to their foundation walls and desecrated the royal tombs. This deed may have had a considerable personal effect on Henry, but politically it put all the trumps in his hand: the plunder of the church and the desecration of the royal tomb caused great outrage in his kingdom, and many Imperial princes returned to Henry's side. The Saxon nobility refused any blame for the actions of the rural population and immediately offered to restore the castle and church at their own expense.\n\n\n== First Battle of Langensalza ==\n\nHenry was once again bent on confrontation and this time gathered a much larger army, although he was not able to march against Saxony until 1075. In the First Battle of Langensalza (known in Germany as the \"Battle of Homburg on the Unstrut\", Homburg being a former monastery near Bad Langensalza) on 9 June 1075 he dealt the Saxon army, which consisted mainly of simple peasants, a crushing defeat and then rampaged through Saxony and Thuringia laying waste.\nAmongst the followers of King Henry who fought with him were the Swabian duke Rudolf of Rheinfelden, Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia, Duke Theoderic II of Upper Lorraine and the Babenberg margrave Ernest of Austria, who was killed in battle, as well as Bishop Hermann of Bamberg and Count Hermann II of Gleiberg. On the Saxon side, in addition to Count Otto of Northeim and Bishop Burchard II von Halberstadt, were Magnus Billung, meanwhile Duke of Saxony, Margrave Lothair Udo II of the Nordmark and Count Gebhard of Supplinburg, who was killed in battle, as well as the Saxon count palatine Frederick II of Goseck and Count Dietrich II of Katlenburg.\nOne of the two leaders, Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt, was detained in Homburg by royal troops and finally handed over on 13 June to the Bishop of Bamberg as a prisoner.\nThe chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld described the battle in his Annals:\n\nThe battle raged from midday until the ninth hour, and the armies of the two states, Swabia and Bavaria, were on the brink of fleeing as messengers repeatedly reported to the King that their people were in danger, when suddenly Count Hermann of Gleiberg and the Bamberg troops launched an attack. Now the Duke of Bohemia, followed by Duke Godfrey of Lorraine galloped with their cavalry to join the battle. The Saxons could not withstand this massive onslaught and slowly fell back.\n\nOn 27 October at the village of Spier near Sondershausen, the Saxon leader finally capitulated to the king in public, i.e. in front of the whole army. Henry had no mercy, but savoured his triumph. The Saxon leader's submission was barefoot, according to Lambert, and the surrender, without exception, unconditional. Henry then held numerous Saxon princes in prison in various places and transferred their fiefs to others.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBeginning almost simultaneously with the surrender, the Investiture Controversy took Henry's full attention in the years that followed. Unrest in Saxony also flared up during this period again and again, but did not reach the same level of political and military as in the time from 1073 to 1075.\nAt the diet of princes in Trebur in October 1076, Otto of Northeim again aligned himself with the opposition. Although he was always a potential candidate, the princes did not choose him; instead, in 1077 in Forchheim, they selected Rudolf of Rheinfelden and, later, Hermann of Salm as antikings. Nevertheless, Otto's had a significant influence on the opposition's politics. Militarily, he distinguished himself again in the battles of Mellrichstadt, Flarchheim and the Elster, leading from the front.\nEven Henry's son, King Henry V of Germany, still had to fight the Saxons. He lost, for example, the 1115 Battle of Welfesholz to the Saxons led by his later successor, King Lothair III.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Primary sources ===\nBruno the Saxon, \"Brunos Sachsenkrieg\" [Brunonis Saxonicum bellum; German], translated by Franz-Josef Schmale.

Wells was also a writer, illustrator, draftsman, lecturer, cartoonist, columnist, and solar energy consultant.\nWells retired from architecture in June 2004, but continued his advocacy for underground living to the end of his life.\nWells' work in architecture and design began in 1953. After 10 years \"spent spreading corporate asphalt on America in the name of architecture,\" he began to feel that the Earth's surface was \"made for living plants, not industrial plants;\" and went into underground architecture. This was reflected in his semi-underground office at Cuthbert Blvd and Park Blvd in Cherry Hill, NJ, adjacent to the Cooper River. His interests were in energy efficiency, aesthetics, land preservation and restoration \"A Regeneration-based Checklist for Design and Construction\", and durability of materials.\nWells' books have sold over 120,000 copies.\nWells died Friday, November 27, 2009. He left behind his wife Karen North Wells and son John Wells .\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHow to buy solar heating ... without getting burnt!

            "content": "Breaking Wind is a 2012 comedy horror parody film, directed by Craig Moss and based on the Twilight film series, specifically Eclipse. It stars Heather Ann Davis, Eric Callero, Frank Pacheco and Danny Trejo. Distributed by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, which became a sister company to Twilight studio Summit Entertainment in 2012, it wound up released only on DVD in the United States.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOne night, a young man named Ronald (Michael Hamilton) is attacked by an unseen assailant, and during the course of the attack he loses his shirt, then one of his teeth, and gains a tattoo. Finally, he's bitten on his buttocks, which causes him to begin transforming into a vampire and incessantly break wind.\nA year later, Bella (Heather Ann Davis) asks her boyfriend Edward Colon (Eric Callero) to transform her into a vampire, but he insists that he marry her first. Bella also has to deal with the affections of Jacob (Frank Pacheco), a member of a pack of overweight, flatulent werewolves. One night, Edward gets a vision of Ronald breaking into Bella's room, and brings her to the Colon family home for help, but they are unsure of what to do. Jacob then takes her to meet his grandfather (Danny Trejo), who recounts the time that he faced an ancient evil that manifested itself as \"different characters all played the exact same way\" (a stab at Johnny Depp and his performances as Jack Sparrow, Edward Scissorhands, Willy Wonka and The Mad Hatter), and believes that a similar incident is about to occur. With this information and a recent spate of people going missing, the Colons are able to deduce that a rogue vampire is creating an army of newborns (or \"noobs\").\nThe army turns out to be under the control of Victoria (Kelsey Collins), who tells Ronald that she wants Bella dead on the ostensible grounds that Edward was responsible for the death of Gary Coleman. The noobs get Bella's scent from a pornographic magazine, and the Colons realize that they cannot protect her, especially because of Rosalie's homicidal rages toward her and Carlisle's (John Stevenson) inability to stop himself from drinking her blood. She seeks refuge with her flamboyantly homosexual father Charlie (Flip Schultz), but soon realizes that she cannot stay with him either, due to his insistence in graphically describing his sex acts and holding orgies at his house. Eventually, Edward works out a compromise with Jacob, who takes Bella to safety and uses his flatulence to mask her scent.\nThat night, Edward meets with Bella and Jacob and the three spend the night in a tent, where Jacob has sex with Bella as an oblivious Edward talks about how he thinks he and Jacob could be friends if they put their differences aside. The following morning the noobs catch up with the trio, but the Colons and Jacob's pack also arrive, and a fight ensues. Bella distracts the noobs by eating a special cake given to her by Jacob, which causes her to experience severe flatulence and creates a smell bad enough to distract Victoria and the noobs long enough for the Colons to kill them all. Bella agrees to marry Edward, while Jacob accidentally ends up stabbing himself to death during a fight with a TMZ reporter.\nThe movie then ends by parodying the trailer to Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 1, followed by a segment ridiculing the reactions to said trailer (in the form of YouTube videos) by certain \"Twi-Hard\" fans of the series.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nHeather Ann Davis - Bella\nEric Callero - Edward\nFrank Pacheco - Jacob\nMichael Hamilton - Ronald\nDanny Trejo - Jacob's grandfather\nKelsey Collins - Victoria\nJohn Stevenson - Carlisle\nFlip Schultz - Charlie\n\n\n== Reception ==\nBreaking Wind was met with negative reviews, mostly comparing it unfavorably to a similar Twilight parody, Vampires Suck, which was already panned. Edward Lawrenson of Time Out declared that \"nothing prepares you for the ineptness and crassness of this \u2018Twilight\u2019 parody\". The A.V. Club reviewed the film and its audio commentary track on the \"Commentary Tracks of the Damned\" section.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBreaking Wind on IMDb\nBreaking Wind at Rotten Tomatoes",

            "content": "The Sautr\u0101ntika were an early Buddhist school generally believed to be descended from the Sthavira nik\u0101ya by way of their immediate parent school, the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins. Their name means literally \"those who rely upon the sutras\", and indicated their rejection of the Abhidharma texts of other early Buddhist schools.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Sautr\u0101ntika indicates that unlike other North Indian Sthaviras, this school held the Buddhist sutras as central to their views, over and above the ideas presented in the Abhidharma literature. The Sarvastivada scholar Samghabhadra, in his Nyayanusara, attacks a school of thought named Sautrantika which he associates with the scholars \u015ar\u012bl\u0101ta and his student Vasubandhu. According to Samghabhadra, a central tenet of this school was that all sutra is explicit meaning (nitartha), hence their name.\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins sometimes referred to them as the D\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ntika school, meaning \"those who utilize the method of examples\". This latter name may have been a pejorative label. It is also possible that the name 'D\u0101r\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ntika' identifies a predecessor tradition, or another related, but distinct, doctrinal position; the exact relationship between the two terms is unclear. Charles Willemen identifies the Sautr\u0101ntika as a Western branch of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins, active in the Gandhara area, who split from the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins sometime before 200 CE, when the Sautr\u0101ntika name emerged. Other scholars are less confident of a specific identification for the Sautr\u0101ntika; Nobuyoshi Yamabe calls specifying the precise identity of the Sautr\u0101ntika \"one of the biggest problems in current Buddhist scholarship.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe founding of the Sautantrika school is attributed to the elder Kumaralata (c. first century), author of a \"collection of drstanta\" (drstantapankti) named Kalpanamanditika. The Sautantrikas were sometimes also called \"disciples of Kumaralata\". According to Chinese sources, Harivarman (250-350 CE) was a student of Kumaralata who became disillusioned with Buddhist Abhidharma and then wrote the Tattvasiddhi-\u015a\u0101stra in order to \"eliminate confusion and abandon the later developments, with the hope of returning to the origin\". The Tattvasiddhi was translated into Chinese and became an important text in Chinese Buddhism until the Tang Dynasty.\nOther works by Sautrantika affiliated authors include the Abhidharmamrtara-sasastra attributed to Ghosaka, and the Abhidharmavatara-sastra attributed to Skandhila. The elder \u015ar\u012bl\u0101ta, who was Vasubandhu's teacher is also known as a famous Sautrantika who wrote the Sautrantika-Vibhasa. Ghosaka's Abhidharmavatara and Harivarman's Tattvasiddhi have both been translated into English.\nThe Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu wrote the famous Abhidharma work Abhidharmako\u015bak\u0101rik\u0101 which presented Sarvastivada-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika Abhidharma tenets, he also wrote a \"bhasya\" or commentary on this work, which presented critiques of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika tradition from a Sautr\u0101ntika perspective. The Abhidharmako\u015ba was highly influential and is the main text on Abhidharma used in Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism up until today.\nThe school of Buddhist logic (pramana) of Dignaga and Dharmakirti are also associated with the Sautrantika view.\n\n\n== Doctrine ==\nNo separate vinaya (monastic code) specific to the Sautr\u0101ntika has been found, nor is the existence of any such separate disciplinary code evidenced in other texts; this indicates that they were likely only a doctrinal division within the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din school.\nThe Sautr\u0101ntika critiziced the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins on various matters such as ontology, philosophy of mind and perception. While the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din abhidharma described a complex system in which past, present, and future phenomena are all held to have some form of their own existence, the Sautr\u0101ntika subscribed to a doctrine of \"extreme momentariness\" that held that only the present moment existed. They seem to have regarded the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din position as a violation of the basic Buddhist principle of impermanence. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din abhidharma also broke down human experience in terms of a variety of underlying phenomena (a view similar to that held by the modern Theravadin abhidhamma); the Sautr\u0101ntika believed that experience could not be differentiated in this manner.\nSautrantika doctrines expounded by elder \u015ar\u012bl\u0101ta and critiqued in turn by Samghabhadra's Nyayanusara include:\nThe theory of anudhatu (or *purvanudhatu, \"subsidiary element\"), which is also associated with the theory of seeds (B\u012bja) expoused by Vasubandhu. This theory was used to explain karma and rebirth.\nThe doctrine that caitasikas (mental factors) are but modes of citta (mind) and are not separate elemental dharmas which come together in \"association\" (samprayoga) as the Sarvastivada believed. This view is also expoused at length in Harivarman's Tattvasiddhi.\nThe doctrine that the sense-elements (dhatu) alone are real existents, not the aggregates (skandha) or sense spheres (ayatana).\nA process of direct perception (pratyaksha) which differed from the direct realism of the Sarvastivada, and instead posited a form of indirect representationalism.\nAccording to Vasubandhu, the Sautr\u0101ntika also held the view that there may be many Buddhas simultaneously, otherwise known as the doctrine of contemporaneous buddhas.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nBuswell, Robert Jr. (2003).

Kyrgyzstan currently doesn't have a FIBA world rank because the national team does not play often enough. Their last match was in the 2015 FIBA Asia Championship qualification Central Asia playoff, a rout loss to Kazakhstan in Astana. The majority of their best players play in Kazakhstan, including rebounding expert center Sergei Kazantcev and Turkish-born player Andrey Kislitsin.\n\n\n== Liga Forward ==\nThe only league in Kyrgyzstan is Liga Forward which consists of mostly Kyrgyzstan players but also features ex-Kazakhstan internationals and ex-Uzbekistan internationals. Most Kyrgyzstan players start off in Liga Forward but they usually move elsewhere like the National Basketball League (Kazakhstan) or the Division 1 of Uzbekistan.\n\n\n== Kyrgyzstan National Basketball Team ==\n\n\n=== Roster ===\nHead coach: Iliya Isakov\n\nArtem Borodenko      | pos =        | m =      | kg =    | team = Dank\nAleksandr Adeykin    | pos = F      | m =      | kg = 94 | team = Bishkek Dynamo\n     | pos = C      | m = 2.23 | kg =    | team = Barsy Atyrau|\n\n\n=== Depth Chart ===\n\n\n== Former Players ==\nDmitriy Danishin (2003-2010)\nVladimir Gellert (2007-2012)\nBaish Adiyev (2008-2011)\n\n\n== Non National Team Players ==\n  Andrey Kislitsin\n  Denis Polokhin\n Anton Dorosev\n Erns Uulu Zhanysh\n\n\n== Coaches ==\n\n\n== Current Staff ==\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n=== FIBA Asia Championship ===\n\n\n=== Novruz Cup ===\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n*Was Assistant Coach but the Liga Forward had to make a quick decision to put him as an Interim Coach. He only took charge for 2 matches in which Kyrinakov lost both and therefore was fired. However, it is unknown who was coach after that and it is also unknown that they played any games.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "John Christopher Columbus Hill (November 15, 1828 \u2013 February 16, 1904) was a Texan citizen who, at age 13, accompanied his brother and father on the Mier Expedition. He was captured, adopted by the Mexican president Santa Anna, and eventually became a successful engineer in the United States and Mexico.\n\n\n== Early life and family ==\nHill was born to Asa and Elizabeth Barksdale Hill on November 15, 1828 in Columbus, Georgia, and was the first Anglo-American born there. His family, including older brother James Monroe Hill, who fought at the Battle of San Jacinto, later moved to Texas in what became Fayette County, in central Texas.\nAt the Battle of San Jacinto the Hills had captured a boy, Jos\u00e9 Mendes, from Santa Anna's army, and they took the boy to raise and educate. John C.C. Hill had the Mexican boy as a brother and playmate. The taking and raising of captive boys was a custom of wars of the early 1800s, since these boys could later function as interpreters.\nJos\u00e9 Mendes was later educated with the Hill children at the newly founded Rutersville College in Texas, while John C.C. Hill attended college in Mexico.\n\n\n== Mier expedition ==\nWhen news came that volunteers were needed to defend San Antonio from the invasion of Mexican General Adri\u00e1n Woll, Asa Hill and Jeffrey Barksdale Hill, John's brother, decided to go. After much debate, it was decided that John, who wanted desperately to go, would be allowed to go. Before leaving, James Monroe Hill lent John his rifle, saying \"John, little brother, I carried this gun at San Jacinto. Since I cannot go, I'll give it to you. Don't you ever surrender it to a Mexican.\" James was sick, so he could not participate in the expedition.\nOn September 15, 1842, the Hills met with another group of volunteers, and as they moved towards San Antonio, this group grew until it numbered about 200. There were a series of events occurring that fall: the capture of San Antonio, the Battle of Salado Creek (1842), the Dawson Massacre, and the Somervell Expedition. The Mier Expedition (about 300 men) was an offshoot of the Somervell Expedition (about 700 men).\nJohn's 14th birthday occurred on November , 1842. By late December, the group had reached the Mexican border. On December 23, a gun accidentally discharged, killing fourteen-year-old Jessie Yocum, a friend of John. Some speculate it could have been his father, Asa Hill, whose gun had discharged.\nOn December 25, the Texans under Captain William S. Fisher moved into the town of Mier, and a battle with Mexican troops under General Pedro de Ampudia ensued. In the Battle of Mier, John and several other boys were given the task of killing members of the Mexican artillery corps, and John shot between 12 and 17 Mexican soldiers.\n\n\n== Aftermath of the Battle of Mier ==\nWhen the Texan soldiers eventually surrendered, they were told to cast down their weapons into a pile. John, however, heeded his brother's request to never give up the rifle and broke his rifle rather than surrender.\nThis brazen act attracted the attention of the Mexicans, and Hill was brought to General Ampudia. Ampudia took a liking to the boy, and rather than make him a prisoner like his father and brother, took John temporarily into his own care.\n\n\n== Life in Mexico ==\nEventually, John was taken to Mexico City where he accepted being adopted by the President, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna. He was educated at the Colegio de Mineria, or Mining School.\nLater, John helped to translate the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and to negotiate railroad deals in the United States and Mexico.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Christopher Columbus Hill entry at The Handbook of Texas Online",

It was originally used to exercise horses. The ground was known as the Recreation Ground or the \"Rec\". Prior to the construction of the WACA Ground in the 1890s, the park was the main cricket ground in Perth.\nThe ground was cleared in 1898 to form a series of cricket fields. The ground was named in honour of the Duke of Wellington, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom at the time of the settlement of the Swan River Colony.\nIn 1901 the ground was used for four West Australian Football League matches.\nBetween 1906 and 1909 West Australian Football League team East Perth were based at Wellington Square but played home games elsewhere.\nPerth Rugby Club (later Perth-Bayswater) used the square from the late 1920s as a training venue.\n\n\n== Current uses ==\nThe square is used as a meeting place by aboriginal peoples, and for cricket and athletics by local schools and clubs. It is also used as a live music venue.\n\n\n== References ==",

Its relatively meager size made Estudiantes use Boca Juniors' Bombonera stadium for its Copa Libertadores games.\n\n\n== Pre-2005 design ==\nThe wooden stands behind the goal-lines were standing-room only. The south-west stands were sitting-room, being separated from 1st Avenue by a row of linden (tilia) trees. The opposite (north-east) side was roofed and used to have the best seating arrangements.\nThe noisiest Estudiantes fans occupied the north-west (55th Street) popular, while visiting fans were directed to the opposite popular on 57th Street, near a technical high school.\nPolice would cut off traffic on 1st Avenue both before and after the games.\nThe stadium was home to three Argentine champion teams (1967, 1982 Metropolitano, and 1983 Nacional).\n\n\n== Closure ==\nIn September 2005, the stadium was closed down for league games because of new safety regulations that forbid wooden stands. Even though a judicial restraining order exempted Estudiantes from the prohibition, the La Plata city government refused to comply.\nThis situation started a rift between the club and mayor Julio Alak.\nWhen a modern stadium was built for the city of La Plata, both Estudiantes and Gimnasia decided against relocating their home games. Immediately after the closure, Estudiantes requested permission for upgrading its stadium to no less than 20,000 seats plus 15,000 standing room, but the mayor refused, insisting that the new stadium should be used.\nAs a stopgap measure, for the 2005 Apertura Estudiantes played its home games in the nearby Gimnasia stadium, and paid Gimnasia a rent of 10% gross income, plus an undisclosed amount for each attending season ticketholder. For the 2006 Clausura, Estudiantes moved its home games to the Quilmes field.\nOn April 2006, a new judicial order allowed the re-opening of 1 y 57, but Alak intervened again to avoid this from happening. At this point, Estudiantes management floated the idea of erecting a new stadium in the port town of Ensenada, a few kilometers east of La Plata.\n\n\n== Agreement and Future Plans ==\nIn August 2006 it was reported that Estudiantes and the city of La Plata reached an agreement to rebuild the stands for a capacity of 20,000, all seated. The city stadium will be used for attendances exceeding that number. The eastern stands will feature the signage Tierra de Campeones (Land of Champions), which was used by fans since the 1960s to refer to 1 y 57.\nPlayer Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n was instrumental in securing the new stadium agreement. Argentine journalists have indicated that with this intervention (as well as a series of donations to upgrade the club's training facilities in City Bell) he is building his reputation towards a future bid for the club presidency.\nOn October 20, 2006, Estudiantes announced that, during the renovation work, it will use the city stadium for home games, as Coprosede (the football security authority) will not grant security clearance for Estudiantes to play home games in Quilmes. Estudiantes fans also became less apprehensive about the city stadium after the historic 7-0 win over Gimnasia on October 2006, and the championship celebrations that took place in the stands, two months later.\nDemolition works were completed during July 2007, after some delays caused by municipal red tape. Construction is scheduled to proceed smoothly, as the club has a budget surplus resulting from strong ticket sales and the proceedings from the transfers of Jos\u00e9 Ernesto Sosa and Mariano Pavone.\nThe stadium will be open in the 2014-15 season.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Stadium Website\nGoogle Maps aerial view looking North.

The company experienced meteoric growth in 2004\u201305 following the launch of their No Sweat sneaker, a Converse look alike, shortly after Nike bought the iconic Chuck Taylor all-star. No Sweat put a spec sheet in the shoe box that detailed the wages and benefits received by their workers and challenged Nike to do the same. No Sweat's challenge to Nike was covered by AP, NPR, Boston Globe and many other media outlets around the world.\nAfter rapid expansion to over 200 fair trade stores around the world in 2005, No Sweat lost their union sneaker factory in 2006. Unwilling to switch to a non-union vendor, the company was never able to replace its hot product. No Sweat finally had to close its retail divisions and passed through bankruptcy in 2011.\nNo Sweat emerged from bankruptcy in 2012. Today it is focused exclusively on wholesale, providing the best priced and largest selection of US union made T-shirts, sweats and hoodies in the U.S. Nurtured by a loyal following of progressive non-profits, union locals, student and church groups, the company is very much open for business.

            "content": "The Moscow Aviation Institute BB-MAI (Russian: \u0411\u0411-\u041c\u0410\u0418) was a Soviet light bomber/attack plane prototype aircraft. Designed in 1939 by Peter Grushin of the Moscow Aviation Institute (MAI, hence the designation), it was delayed by problems with the new Klimov M-105 engine and eventually only a single prototype was built. While the design was not accepted for serial production, it was the first Soviet aircraft to use a tricycle landing gear and one of the first to feature a supercharger and leading-edge slats.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\nThe work on the design was started in 1938, but was delayed by the fact that the intended powerplant, the modern Klimov M-105 engine, was still under development. In early 1939 work commenced on the first prototype, but proceeded at a very slow pace. The construction team was led by A.A. Lebedinski and A.A. Manucharov. It was not until late 1940 that the prototype was completed and flight-tested by MAI's own test pilot A.N. Grinchik. By that time the Soviet Air Forces lost interest in the design and focused on the more advanced Ilyushin Il-2 instead. As neither this design nor the even more revolutionary Sh-MAI were accepted, the Design Bureau of the Moscow Aviation Institute was disbanded and its head Pyotr Grushin was sent to Kharkov as the new head of a local Aircraft Factory No. 135.\nThe two-spar wings of BB-MAI were of mixed construction typical to other Soviet experimental designs of the era. Each wing was equipped with leading-edge slats and was composed of three crescent-shaped caisson sections, each formed of fanera \u2013 layers of plywood strengthened with glue and bakelite. The fuselage was a typical wooden monocoque reinforced with fanera. The materials used in the BB-MAI were designed at the VIAM Institute. The relatively small wings resulted in relatively high wing loading to maximise the aircraft's cruising speed.\nThe engine was equipped with a new experimental TsIAM supercharger powered by exhaust fumes. The aircraft was equipped with a modern tricycle landing gear, with the front wheel retracting into a bay in front of the engine's radiator, while main gears retracted into wing bays close to the fuselage.\n\n\n== Specifications (BB-MAI) ==\nData from Volkov, op. cit.\nGeneral characteristics\nCrew: 2\nLength: 9.60 m (31 ft 6 in)\nWingspan: 10.00 m (32 ft 10 in)\nWing area: 15.20 m2 (163.6 sq ft)\nEmpty weight: 2,965 kg (6,537 lb)\nMax takeoff weight: 3,490 kg (7,694 lb)\nPowerplant: 1 \u00d7 Klimov M-105 V12 liquid-cooled piston engine, 780 kW (1,050 hp)\nPerformance\nMaximum speed: 550 km/h (342 mph; 297 kn)\nRange: 500 km (311 mi; 270 nmi)\nService ceiling: 9,000 m (30,000 ft)\nWing loading: 210 kg/m2 (43 lb/sq ft)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nPictures of the prototype",
