It lies relatively close to the Sun at a distance of about 14.8 light years. It is a flare star, which means it can suddenly increase in brightness for short periods of time.\nIt has the space velocity components [U, V, W] = [28, \u221216, \u221214] km/s.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of nearest stars\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nARICNS entry",

            "content": "RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase, also known as proto-oncogene c-RAF or simply c-Raf or even Raf-1, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the RAF1 gene. The c-Raf protein is part of the ERK1/2 pathway as a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) that functions downstream of the Ras subfamily of membrane associated GTPases. C-Raf is a member of the Raf kinase family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases, from the TKL (Tyrosine-kinase-like) group of kinases.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe first Raf gene, v-Raf was found in 1983. It was isolated from the murine retrovirus bearing the number 3611. It was soon demonstrated to be capable to transform rodent fibroblasts to cancerous cell lines, so this gene was given the name Virus-induced Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (V-RAF). A year later, another transforming gene was found in the avian retrovirus MH2, named v-Mil - that turned out to be highly similar to v-Raf. Researchers were able to demonstrate that these genes encode enzymes that have serine-threonine kinase activity. Normal cellular homologs of v-Raf and v-Mil were soon found in both the mouse and chicken genome (hence the name c-Raf for the normal cellular Raf gene), and it became clear that these too had a role in regulating growth and cell division. Now we know that c-Raf is a principal component of the first described mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: ERK1/2 signaling. It acts as a MAP3 kinase, initiating the entire kinase cascade. Subsequent experiments showed that the normal, cellular Raf genes can also mutate to become oncogenes, by \"overdriving\" MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity. In fact, vertebrate genomes contain multiple Raf genes. Several years later after the discovery of c-Raf, two further related kinases were described: A-Raf and B-Raf. The latter became the focus of research in recent years, since a large portion of human tumors carry oncogenic 'driver' mutations in the B-Raf gene. These mutations induce an uncontrolled, high activity of Raf enzymes. Thus diagnostic and therapeutic interest in Raf kinases reached a new peak in the recent years.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe human c-Raf gene is located on chromosome 3. At least two isoforms of mRNA have been described (arising from inclusion or removal of an alternative exon) that display only minute differences. The shorter, major isoform - consisting of 17 exons - encodes a protein kinase of 648 amino acids.\n\nSimilarly to many other MAPKKKs, c-Raf is a multidomain protein, with several additional domains to aid the regulation of its catalytic activity. On its N-terminal segment, a Ras-binding domain (RBD) and a C-kinase homologous domain 1 (C1 domain) are found next to each other. Structures of both conserved domains were solved in the past decades, shedding light on the mechanisms of their regulation.\nThe Ras-binding domain displays a ubiquitin-like fold (like many other small G-protein associating domains) and selectively binds GTP-bound Ras proteins only. (You can see this interaction in high detail in the PDB box attached to the article. It shows Rap1 in complex with the RBD of c-Raf.)\nThe C1 domain - immediately downstream of the Ras binding domain - is a special zinc finger, rich in cysteines and stabilized by two zinc ions. It is similar to the diacylglycerol-binding C1 domains of protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes. But unlike PKC, the C1 domains of Raf family kinases do not bind diacylglycerol. Instead, they interact with other lipids, such as ceramide or phosphatidic acid, and even aid in the recognition of activated Ras (GTP-Ras).\nThe close proximity of these two domains as well as several lines of experimental data suggest that they act as a single unit to negatively regulate the activity of the protein kinase domain, by direct physical interaction. Historically, this autoinhibitory block was labelled as the CR1 region (\"Conserved Region 1\"), the hinge region being named CR2, and the kinase domain CR3. Unfortunately, the precise structure of the autoinhibited kinase remains unknown.\nBetween the autoinhibitory domain block and the catalytic kinase domain, a long segment - characteristic to all Raf proteins - can be found. It is highly enriched in serine amino acids, but its precise sequence is poorly conserved across related Raf genes. This region appears to be intrinsically unstructured, and very flexible. Its most likely role is to act as a natural \"hinge\" between the rigidly folded autoinhibitory and catalytic domains, enabling complex movements and profound conformational rearrangements within the molecule. This hinge region contains a small, conserved island of amino acids, that are responsible for 14-3-3 protein recognition, but only when a critical serine (Ser259 in human c-Raf) is phosphorylated. A second, similar motif is found on the extreme C-terminus (centered around the phosphorylatable Ser 621) of all Raf enzymes, but downstream of the kinase domain.\nThe C-terminal half of c-Raf folds into a single protein domain, responsible for catalytic activity. The structure of this kinase domain is well-known from both c-Raf and B-Raf. It is highly similar to other Raf kinases and KSR proteins, and distinctly similar to some other MAP3 kinases, such as the Mixed Lineage Kinase (MLK) family. Together they comprise the Tyrosine Kinase Like (TKL) group of protein kinases. Although some features unite their catalytic domains with protein tyrosine kinases, the activity of TKLs is restricted to the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues within target proteins. The most important substrate of Raf kinases (apart from itself) are the MKK1 and MKK2 kinases, whose activity strictly depends on phosphorylation events performed by Rafs.\n\n\n== Evolutionary relationships ==\n\nHuman c-Raf is a member of a larger family of related protein kinases. Two further members - found in most vertebrates - belong to the same family: B-Raf and A-Raf. Apart from the different length of their non-conserved N- and C-terminal ends, they all share the same domain architecture, structure and regulation. In comparison to the relatively well-known c-Raf and B-Raf, there is very little known of the precise function of A-Raf, but it is also thought to be similar to the other two members of the family. All these genes are believed to be the product of full gene or genome duplications at the dawn of vertebrate evolution, from a single ancestral Raf gene. Most other animal organisms possess only a single Raf gene. It is called Phl or Draf in Drosophila and Lin-45 in C. elegans.\n\nMulticellular animals also have a type of kinase closely related to Raf: this is the Kinase Suppressor of Ras (KSR). Vertebrates like mammals have two, paralogous KSR genes instead of one: KSR1 and KSR2. Their C-terminal kinase domain is very similar to Raf (originally called CA5 in KSR and CR3 in Raf), but the N-terminal regulatory region differs. Although they also have the flexible hinge (CA4 in KSR) and a C1 domain (CA3 in KSR) before it, KSRs entirely lack the Ras-binding domain. Instead, they have unique regulatory regions on their N-termini, originally termed CA1 (\"conserved area 1\") and CA2. For a long time, the structure of the CA1 domain was a mystery. However, in 2012, the structure of the CA1 region in KSR1 was solved: it turned out to be a divergent SAM (sterile alpha motif) domain, supplemented with coiled-coils (CC-SAM): this is supposed to aid KSRs in membrane binding. KSRs, like Rafs, also have the twin 14-3-3 associating motifs (that depend on phosphorylation), but also possess novel MAPK-binding motifs on their hinge regions. With a typical sequence Phe-x-Phe-Pro (FxFP) these motifs are important for the feedback regulation of Raf kinases in the ERK1/2 pathway. According to our current knowledge, KSRs also participate in the same pathway as Raf, although they only play an auxiliary role. With a very poor intrinsic kinase activity, they were long thought to be inactive, until their catalytic activity was finally demonstrated in recent years. But even then, they contribute only negligibly to MKK1 and MKK2 phosphorylation. The main role of KSR appears to be to provide a heterodimerization partner to Raf enzymes, greatly facilitating their activation by means of allostery. Similar phenomena were described for other MAP3 kinases. ASK2, for example, is a poor enzyme on its own, and it activity appears to be tied to ASK1/ASK2 heterodimerisation.\nRaf-like kinases are fully absent from fungi. But recent sequencing of other opisthokonts (e.g. Capsaspora owczarzaki) revealed the presence of genuine Raf kinases in unicellular eukaryotes. Therefore, it is possible that Raf proteins are an ancient heritage and ancestors of fungi secondarily lost Raf-dependent signaling. Fungal MAP kinase pathways that are homologous to the mammalian ERK1/2 pathway (Fus3 and Kss1 in yeast) are activated by MEKK-related kinases (e.g. Ste11 in yeast) instead of Raf enzymes.\nRaf kinases found in retroviruses (such as murine v-Raf) are secondarily derived from the corresponding vertebrate genes of their hosts. These Raf genes encode severely truncated proteins, that lack the entire N-terminal autoinhibitory domain, and the 14-3-3 binding motifs. Such severe truncations are known to induce an uncontrolled activity of Raf kinases: that is just exactly what a virus may need for efficient reproduction.\n\n\n== Regulation of activity ==\n\nAs mentioned above, the regulation of c-Raf activity is complex. As a \"gatekeeper\" of the ERK1/2 pathway, it is kept in check by a multitude of inhibitory mechanisms, and normally cannot be activated in a single step. The most important regulatory mechanism involves the direct, physical association of the N-terminal autoinhibitory block to the kinase domain of c-Raf. It results in the occlusion of the catalytic site and full shutdown of kinase activity. This \"closed\" state can only be relieved if the autoinhibitory domain of Raf engages a partner competing with its own kinase domain, most importantly GTP-bound Ras. Activated small G-proteins can thus break up the intramolacular interactions: this results in a conformational change (\"opening\") of c-Raf necessary for kinase activation and substrate binding.\n14-3-3 proteins also contribute to the autoinhibition. As 14-3-3 proteins are all known to form constitutive dimers, their assemblies have two binding sites. Thus the dimer acts as a \"molecular handcuff\", locking their binding partners at a fixed distance and orientation. When the precisely positioned twin 14-3-3 binding motifs are engaged by a single 14-3-3 protein dimer (such as 14-3-3 zeta), they become locked into a conformation that promotes autoinhibition and does not allow the disengagement of the autoinhibitory and catalytic domains. This \"lockdown\" of c-Raf (and other Rafs as well as KSRs) is controlled by motif phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated 14-3-3 associating motifs do not bind their partners: they need to get phosphorylated on conserved serines (Ser 259 and Ser 621) first, by other protein kinases. The most important kinase implicated in this event is TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and the enzymes dedicated for removal of these phosphates are the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complexes.\nNote that 14-3-3 binding of Raf enzymes is not necessarily inhibitory: once Raf is open and dimerizes, 14-3-3s can also bind in trans, bridging two kinases and \"handcuffing\" them together to reinforce the dimer, instead of keeping them away from each other. Further modes of 14-3-3 interactions with c-Raf also exist, but their role is not well known.\nDimerisation is another important mechanism for c-Raf activity regulation and required for Raf activation loop phosphorylation. Normally, only the \"open\" kinase domains participate in dimerisation. Unlike B-Raf, that readily forms homodimers with itself, c-Raf prefers heterodimerisation with either B-Raf or KSR1. Homodimers and heterodimers all behave similarly. The B-Raf homodimer kinase domain structure clearly shows that the activation loops (that control the catalytic activity of all known protein kinases) are positioned in an active-like conformation in the dimer. This is due to an allosteric effect of the other molecule binding to the \"back\" side of the kinase; such dimers are symmetric and have two, partially active catalytic sites. At this stage, the activity of Raf kinases is low, and unstable.\n\nTo achieve full activity and stabilize the active state, the activation loop of c-Raf needs to be phosphorylated. The only kinases currently known to perform this act are the Raf family kinases themselves. But some other kinases, such as PAK1 can phosphorylate other residues near the kinase domain of c-Raf: the precise role of these auxiliary kinases is unknown. In the context of c-Raf, both c-Raf and KSR1 are needed for the \"transphosphorylation\" step. Due to the architecture of the dimers, this phosphorylation can only take place in trans (i.e. one dimer phosphorylates another, in a four-membered transitional complex). By interacting with conserved Arg and Lys residues in the kinase domain, the phosphorylated activation loops shift conformation and become ordered, permanently locking the kinase domain into a fully active state until dephosphorylated. The phosphorylated activation loops also render the kinase insensitive to the presence of its autoinhibitory domain. KSRs cannot undergo this last step as they miss any phosphorylatable residues in their activation loops. But once c-Raf is fully activated, there is no further need to do so: active Raf enzymes can now engage their substrates. Like most protein kinases, c-Raf has multiple substrates. BAD (Bcl2-atagonist of cell death) is directly phosphorylated by c-Raf, along with several types of adenylate cyclases, myosin phosphatase (MYPT), cardiac muscle troponin T (TnTc), etc. The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and Cdc25 phosphatase were also suggested as possible substrates.\nThe most important targets of all Raf enzymes are MKK1(MEK1) and MKK2(MEK2). Although the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex c-Raf:MKK1 is unknown, it can be precisely modelled after the KSR2:MKK1 complex. Here no actual catalysis takes place, but it is thought to be highly similar to the way Raf binds to its substrates. The main interaction interface is provided by the C-terminal lobes of both kinase domains; the large, disordered, proline-rich loop unique to MKK1 and MKK2 also plays an important role in its positioning to Raf (and KSR). These MKKs become phosphorylated at at least two sites on their activation loops upon binding to Raf: this will activate them too. The targets of the kinase cascade are ERK1 and ERK2, that are selectively activated by MKK1 or MKK2. ERKs have numerous substrates in cells; they are also capable of translocating into the nucleus to activate nuclear transcription factors. Activated ERKs are pleiotropic effectors of cell physiology and play an important role in the control of gene expression involved in the cell division cycle, cell migration, inhibition of apoptosis, and cell differentiation.\n\n\n== Associated human diseases ==\nHereditary gain-of-function mutations of c-Raf are implicated in some rare, but severe syndromes. Most of these mutations involve singe amino acid changes at one of the two 14-3-3 binding motifs. Mutation of c-Raf is one of the possible causes of Noonan syndrome: affected individuals have congenital heart defects, short and dysmorphic stature and several other deformities. Similar mutations in c-Raf can also cause a related condition, termed LEOPARD syndrome (Lentigo, Electrocardiographic abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retarded growth, Deafness), with a complex association of defects.\n\n\n== Role in cancer ==\nAlthough c-Raf is very clearly capable of mutating into an oncogene in experimental settings, and even in a few human tumors, its brethren kinase B-Raf is the true major player in carcinogenesis in humans.\n\n\n=== B-Raf mutations ===\nApproximately 20% of all examined human tumor samples display a mutated B-Raf gene. The overwhelming majority of these mutations involve the exchange of a single amino acid: Val 600 into Glu,and this aberrant gene product (BRAF-V600E) can be visualized by immunohistochemistry for clinical molecular diagnostics The aberration can mimic the activation loop phosphorylation and - by jumping all control steps at normal activation - immediately render the kinase domain fully active. Since B-Raf can also activate itself by homodimerisation and c-Raf by heterodimerisation, this mutation has a catastrophic effect by turning the ERK1/2 pathway constitutively active, and driving an uncontrolled process of cell division.\n\n\n== As a therapeutic target ==\nDue to the importance of both Ras and B-Raf mutations in tumorigenesis, several Raf inhibitors were developed to combat cancer, especially against B-Raf exhibiting the V600E mutation. Sorafenib was the first clinically useful agent, that provides a pharmacological alternative to treat previously largely untreatable malignacies, such as renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Several other molecules followed up, such as Vemurafenib, Regorafenib, Dabrafenib, etc.\nUnfortunately, ATP-competitive B-Raf inhibitors may have an undesired effect in K-Ras-dependent cancers: They are simply too selective for B-Raf. While they perfectly well inhibit B-Raf activity in case a mutant B-Raf is the primary culprit, they also promote homo- and heterodimerisation of B-Raf, with itself and c-Raf. This will actually enhance c-Raf activation instead of inhibiting it in case there is no mutation in any Raf genes, but their common upstream activator K-Ras protein is the one mutated. This \"paradoxical\" c-Raf activation necessitates the need to screen for B-Raf mutations in patients (by genetic diagnostics) before starting a B-Raf-inhibitor therapy.\n\n\n== List of interacting proteins ==\nC-Raf has been shown to interact with:\n\n\n== See also ==\nRaf kinases\nA-Raf kinase\nB-Raf kinase\nKSR1 protein\nKSR2 protein\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Noonan syndrome\nDomain structure diagrams for Raf-1, A-Raf and B-Raf.\nDrosophila pole hole - The Interactive Fly\nc-raf Proteins at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\nHuman RAF1 genome location and RAF1 gene details page in the UCSC Genome Browser.",

Flex Comix published the first tank\u014dbon volume of the manga on April 10, 2007. The manga was previously licensed in North America by CMX, where three volumes were released before CMX shut down. The manga is licensed in Taiwan by Tong Li Publishing. The manga was adapted into six 50 minute animated films. Sentai Filmworks has licensed the movie series and released them on DVD and Blu-ray in 2012. The anime movies are also available online on Crunchyroll.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story is centered around a young man named Rygart Arrow, a resident of a world where people can use \"magic\". This magic is the ability to control and empower quartz, doing many things from creating light to operating machinery to riding giant mecha called 'Golems'. Rygart, however, is one of the few exceptions; as an \"un-sorcerer\", he cannot utilize quartz, making many aspects of life difficult as well as being looked down upon by the rest of society. Despite this, in his youth he managed to befriend Hodr and Sigyn, the future King and Queen of the Krisna Kingdom; and Zess, the younger brother of the Secretary of War of the Athens Commonwealth.\nYears later, Rygart is reunited with Hodr and Sigyn where he learns the Athens Commonwealth has begun an invasion of Krisna. Rygart is also shocked to learn that Zess is leading one of the strike forces. While at the capital, Rygart discovers that he has the ability to pilot a recently discovered ancient Golem which cannot be piloted by magic users. Despite its ancient origins, the golem possesses capabilities and systems far more advanced than the current Golems, and could be key to turning the tide of battle. While hesitant at first, Rygart soon gets involved in the war between Krisna and Athens, in an attempt to save Hodr, Sigyn, and Zess.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== The Kingdom of Krisna ===\nRygart Arrow (\u30e9\u30a4\u30ac\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc, Raigatto Ar\u014d)\nVoiced by: S\u014dichir\u014d Hoshi (Japanese); Greg Ayres (English)\nRygart is the series' main protagonist at the age of 25. He was born an \"un-sorcerer\", meaning that he cannot use magic, unlike the majority of his world's populace. Before he left to see Hodr, he worked on a farm with his brother who is also an un-sorcerer, and because of this, his father sold all Quartz operated tools and worked with tools without Quartz to make the boys stronger and to keep them from feeling like outcasts. After his father took out loans, Rygart was able to attend Assam military school where he befriended Zess, Hodr, and Sigyn where the four of them were known as \"the four problem children of Assam's Military School\", with him being known as the \"King of Make-up tests\". He hates violence and believes he could win via his opponent tiring out but is willing to fight more directly and violently with his enemies. He becomes the pilot of the Delphine, an ancient Golem designed for only an un-sorcerer's use as a Heavy Knight for Krisna. He originally joins the war to protect his brother and friends, but later admits he is really fighting to protect Sigyn who he really loves. Initially, Rygart is extremely hostile towards Girge when they are teamed up, yet acknowledges the other pilot's skills as a pilot. Rygart eventually comes to recognize Girge as an 'outcast' like himself, and is devastated after Girge sacrifices himself for Rygart. Rygart later spearheads the counter assault on Binonten and has a rematch with Borcuse, this time managing to kill the General, but is left with only more questions about his role in the war. After Borcuse's death, Rygart is promoted to Warrant Officer and given the title, \"Hero of Krisna\".\nSigyn Erster (\u30b7\u30ae\u30e5\u30f3\u30fb\u30a8\u30eb\u30b9\u30c6\u30eb, Shigyun Erusuteru)\nVoiced by: Chiwa Saito (Japanese); Emily Neves (English)\nSigyn is the 25-year-old Queen of Krisna and Hodr's wife and a close friend of Rygart. They went to the same military school as him, where she was known as the \"Mad Scientist\" for secluding herself in the school's lab for up to 3 days and nights at a time without eating or drinking. She pursues a career of science and cares deeply for her friends, to the point of pointing a gun at Rygart upon first seeing him to ask why he did not show up at her wedding and confirm that he does not hate her. While she is the Queen, she rarely acts like one as she usually spends her time in the castle maintenance workshop tinkering with machines alongside the royal engineers. Even though she and Hodr are married, they both sleep in separate chambers. It is later revealed that Sigyn was in love with Rygart during their days in military school. When Rygart left school to take over his father's farm, Sigyn attempted to confess her feelings to him, but he purposely ignored her, not wanting Sigyn to live a life of ridicule as the wife of an unsorcerer. Even after her marriage to Hodr, she still loves Rygart. While complimenting each other on their hair, Cleo says \"Blonde hair...Is much prettier\" to which an exhausted Sigyn replies \"Black...For one single moment...I...Really....Liked it\". Sigyn later petitions Hodr for a divorce, but he has yet to give her an answer. Regardless, Sigyn has been spending more and more time with Rygart in an attempt to help him overcome the guilt and trauma he has experienced on the battlefield.\nHodr (\u30db\u30ba\u30eb (\u30af\u30ea\u30b7\u30e5\u30ca9\u4e16), Hozuru)\nVoiced by: Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese); Kalob Martinez (English)\nHodr is the 25-year-old king of Krisna and Sigyn's husband. He befriended Rygart at Assam military school when he ditched class to help him save an owl after he spotted him from his classroom's window. He was known as the \"Crowned Prince\" for staring at the sky and scoring failing grades. He does not want to be king, but tries to be a good leader and cares greatly for his people's lives. Despite being married with Sigyn, he does not shows any feelings for his wife and is aware she loves Rygart. During the cease-fire before the Battle of Binonten, Hodr reveals to Rygart that he has lost all romantic interest in Sigyn and that she has petitioned him for a divorce but later put it on hold. He then berates Rygart for not being honest about his feelings for Sigyn. In truth, he still loves Sigyn. However he suppresses it because he always knew Sigyn and Rygart have always loved each other. He has a younger sister named Lindy who is married to a General from the Orlando Empire.\nNarvi Stryze (\u30ca\u30eb\u30f4\u30a3\u30fb\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba, Naruvi Sutoraizu)\nVoiced by: Marina Inoue (Japanese); Shelley Calene-Black (English)\nNarvi is a 24-year-old female Upper Class Heavy Knight from Krisna. She previously served under General True before being assigned to command her own squad. As a squad leader she has a tendency to be brash and impulsive, always trying to be at the front of battle. Her actions are the result of her desire to prove her worth as a field commander, so that she may be able to serve in General True's inner circle of officers. She is devastated after finding that General True was killed in battle. After the Battle of Binonten, Narvi is promoted and becomes one of General Baldr's front-line commanders. She also receives a prototype new-model Golem with greater speed and maneuverability.She has feelings for Rygart.\nNile Stryze (\u30ca\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ba, Nairu Sutoraizu)\nVoiced by: Minoru Shiraishi (Japanese); Dylan Godwin (Films 1-4), Andrew Love (Film 6) (English)\nNile is Narvi's older brother and a First Class Heavy Knight.\nLoggin (\u30ed\u30ae\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30fc\u30fb\u30ac\u30eb\u30d5\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b5\u30f3\u30b9, Rogin J\u012b Garufu Ensansu)\nVoiced by: Tomoya Kawai (Japanese); David Matranga (English)\nA 29-year-old male Upper First Class Heavy Knight from Krisna who serves as a mech sniper.

He is one of Krisna's most prized generals. He serves as a mentor to Rygart on becoming a soldier and is also his Commanding officer. He has a son named Girge but has since disowned him due to the latter killing one of his fellow cadets and injuring 8 others during a training exercise without reason. Baldr was away on border patrol when that incident occurred and has never been able to get the full story from his son or the reasons for his actions. Baldr attempts to ease Rygart's conscious after he delivers Girge's body to him. Baldr has shown great concern for Rygart, seeing how the pressures and traumas of the war have weighed on Rygart's mind, and is afraid they may drive Rygart down the same path that ultimately 'broke' his son.\nGeneral True (\u30c8\u30a5\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30fb\u30b3\u30fc\u30eb\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30fb\u30ea\u30e0\u30ec\u30c3\u30af, Turu B\u0101 K\u014druwei Rimurekku)\nVoiced by: Kenichi Ogata (Japanese); Chris Ayres (English)\nA hot-headed General of Krisna who always immediately runs into the battle without strategy much to the trouble of those under his command. Despite these flaws, he is well loved by the people of Krisna due to donating all of his money to the orphanages of Krisna and even taking care of the orphans himself with two of those orphans being Narvi and Nile. He is killed at the end of Volume 4 due to his hot-headed impatience leading his forces right into an obvious ambush by the Athens Invasion Force.\nCaptain Sakura (\u30b5\u30af\u30e9, Sakura)\nVoiced by: Nanaho Katsuragi (Japanese); Luci Christian (Films 1, 3-6), Melissa Davis (Film 2) (English)\nA tall female military instructor for Krisna.

He is skilled in sniping and using a Katana with his Golem, a modified Athens's Artemis and takes the opportunity when given the chance to fight other skilled mechs whether they be comrade or foe. Due to his attitude and past actions, General Baldr has ordered his squad-mates to execute him should Girge try to attack any of them. His instability was the result of the pressure trying to live up to people's expectations who expected him to follow in his father's footsteps. But what may have started his instability was when during his childhood, he and his father rescued a village from a group of escaped prisoners where he allowed his father to shoot him in the leg as a distraction when one of the prisoners took him hostage. Girge fights against several of General Borcuse's elite guard while protecting Rygart and the rest of his squad. He manages to severely damage or disable all of their heavy mechs before finally being disabled and captured. He is later killed by Borcuse by fooling the General into believing he is the pilot of the Delphine.\nRegatz Arrow (\u30ec\u30ac\u30c3\u30c4\u30fb\u30a2\u30ed\u30fc, Regattsu Ar\u014d)\nVoiced by: Masumi Asano (Japanese); Luci Christian (English)\nRygart's younger brother.

He met Rygart at Assam military school, where he was called \"straight-laced Zess\". He was the best pilot cadet in the academy's history and was full of pride. He first met Rygart when Rygart was being bullied and refused to stand up for himself. Zess defended him and quickly befriended Rygart afterward. When he learns his nation plans to conquer Krisna, he leads his Valkyrie Squadron, a small commando strike force of mechs to the Krisna capital in order to make Hodr surrender quickly to spare his friends and their country from the wrath of the main Athens Invasion Army, unaware that the leaders of Athens gave an unofficial condition of surrendering to Hodr: The execution of the whole royal family, including Sigyn. Ultimately his mission is a failure which costs the lives of two of his subordinates and the capture of Cleo. In his last confrontation with Rygart, he is critically injured when his cockpit is crushed. He returns home to his wife and two-year-old daughter, all the while greatly regretting the consequences that awaits Krisna by the main Invasion force. After the death of General Borcuse, and at the request of his brother, he was ordered to lead the second Athenian invasion force. Zess's Valkyrie Squadron Golems are the lightweight mech, Artemis.\nCleo Saburafu (\u30af\u30ec\u30aa\u30fb\u30b5\u30fc\u30d6\u30e9\u30d5, Kureo S\u0101burafu)\nVoiced by: Kana Hanazawa (Japanese); Brittney Karbowski (English)\nA subordinate of Zess, Cleo is a 12-year-old mech pilot who looks like a teenager; her friend Lee used to make fun of her for being extremely developed for her age. She's a quick learner, but despite this she is very clumsy and somewhat a slow thinker with some subjects. She says her positive skills are cooking, laundry, and keeping watch without even getting tired. She graduated from military school after two years, when it ordinarily takes six years. When Cleo learns that Lee was killed in battle, Cleo believes Rygart killed her (unaware that Lee committed suicide) and initially wants to kill him. Afterward, she meets Rygart in battle and shows a surprising amount of skill contrary to how she was before, almost defeating Rygart. She is defeated shortly after securing Zess's escape and taken prisoner, where she was treated very leniently and shared a room with Sigyn. She initially tried to escape by securing Sigyn's gun and attempting to kill Rygart, but fails because the gun actually had no ammo. She befriends Sigyn and no longer tries to escape afterward. Later, she is released in a hostage exchange for Rygart and his squad. Her family has been serving the Athens military for three generations, with her grandmother a retired mech pilot who is now an Athens military academy instructor and her mother, a high-ranking officer in the Athens military.\nErekt (\u30a8\u30ec\u30af\u30c8\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30fc\u30df\u30f3\u30ac\u30e0, Erekuto V\u0113mingamu)\nVoiced by: Hideyuki Umezu (Japanese); Andy McAvin (English)\nA soldier of Athens and a subordinate of Zess.

She is friends with Cleo, where both of them went to military school together. During the attack at the Krisna's capital, Lee commits suicide after being saved by Rygart from another Krisna soldier attempting to finish her off, believing being dead is much better than being a prisoner of the Krisna \"barbarians\", devastating Rygart.\nArgath (\u30a2\u30eb\u30ac\u30b9\u30fb\u30eb\u30a4\u30d3\u30eb\u30fb\u30c7\u30fb\u30d9\u30c3\u30c4\u30d0\u30fc\u30b0, Arugasu Ruibiru De Bettsub\u0101gu)\nVoiced by: Kenichi Ogata (Japanese); Corey Hartzog (English)\nA soldier of Athens and a subordinate of Zess.

He is the mastermind of the Athens Invasion of Krisna. Officially, he claims the invasion was to punish Krisna for harboring troops from Orlando, Athens' longtime enemy, during the previous war. However, in reality it is an excuse to claim Krisna's rich, extensive quartz mines as Athens' own quartz resources are dwindling. After Borcuse's death it is revealed that Loquis is suffering from a terminal illness and is bedridden. At his order, he promotes Zess to General and appoints him as the leader of the Second Krishna Invasion Force. He also asks for Zess to protect and raise his young son.\nGeneral Borcuse (\u30dc\u30eb\u30ad\u30e5\u30b9\u30fb\u30c7\u30e5\u30c3\u30bb\u30f3\u30eb\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5, Borukyusu Dyussenrudorufu)\nVoiced by: Kazuya Nakai (Japanese); Jay Hickman (English)\nOne of Athens's most infamous Generals. To his subordinates, he is seen as a loving father and a good friend, but in reality, he is a cold and calculating man who will not hesitate to commit heinous acts of barbarism to achieve his goals. Borcuse was placed under house arrest for committing a war crime during the Invasion of Assam, where he slaughtered innocent villagers and displayed their bodies as a way to intimidate and bait his enemies. The Athens government pardons Borcuse and makes him leader of the Krisna Invasion Force, believing that his tactics, while brutal, are the fastest way to defeat Krisna. He is a highly skilled mech pilot and is accompanied by five other specially chosen pilots who serve as his elite guard and troop commanders. When Borcuse attempts to slaughter a village to goad the Krisna forces, he is confronted by Rygart and the two duel. Rygart manages to deal a significant amount of damage to Borcuse's Golem but the General becomes 'bored' and disables the Delphine. Recognizing that the Delphine is ancient technology, Borcuse orders Rygart to be killed and his mech taken back to Athens but Rygart managed to escape, dealing a blow to Borcuse's pride. Borcuse's reputation suffers another blow when Girge duels and kills one of his commanders, Bades including the elite Golems that were accompanying Bades. Girge and Rygart are captured and brought before Borcuse where he proceeds to shoot Girge in the head prior to a prisoner exchange. Borcuse and Rygart engage in a rematch at the end of the Siege of Binonten, in which Rygart ultimately emerges the victor. Initially ordered to be taken as a prisoner, Borcuse taunts Rygart with memories of Girge, causing Rygart to kill the General. Borcuse's Golem is the Hykelion, a giant, black mech that possess a pair of \"scorpion tails\" on the shoulders that he uses as a secret weapon which he hides under his mech's cape.\nColonel Io (\u30a4\u30aa\u30fb\u30ab\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30fc\u30eb, Io Karudab\u0101ru)\nVoiced by: Takuma Terashima (Japanese); David Wald (English)\nBorcuse's second in command. Relatively young for a field commander, Io is greatly respected for both his prowess in battle and his abilities as a tactician. While he appears intimidating, due to his tall height and a large prominent scar on his face, Io is a kind man who treats civilians and children with respect. Io disapproves of the barbaric acts that Borcuse and his fellow commanders commit against civilians and enemy combatants. He is also in a relationship with Borcuse's daughter. As one of Borcuse's elite guard and commanders, Io rides the Toria, a blue-colored customized Golem which utilizes both swords and guns. After Borcuse is killed, Io returns to Athens and resigns from the military, guilt-ridden over his perceived inability to protect Borcuse and his fellow commanders.\nBades (\u30d0\u30c7\u30b9\u30fb\u30bb\u30ed\u30d5\u30fb\u30a6\u30ea\u30e4\u30ce\u30d5\u30b9\u30af, Badesu Serofu Uriyanofusuku)\nVoiced by: Kazuyoshi Hayashi (Japanese); Chris Hutchison (English)\nOne of Borcuse's elite guards and commanders. A bald, middle-aged man, he is Borcuse's Lieutenant and strategist. Unfortunately, Nike has no respect for him and usually insults him if his plans fails or makes fun of his baldness. After he and Borcuse's men were ambushed by Girge, which resulted in the death of several Athens pilots including his comrade Iris, he returns to face Girge again with the Spartans, an elite group of Athens pilots with customized Golems where he tries to convince Girge to side with Athens instead. However, Girge refuses and proceeds to kill all of the Spartans before finally killing Bades himself. His name is derived from the Greek god Hades. Bades' rides a customized gold-colored golem whose primary weapons are a heavy gun-lance and a powerful shoulder-mounted cannon.\nIris (\u30a2\u30a4\u30ec\u30b9\u30fb\u30d1\u30c8\u30d0\u30fb\u30a2\u30ec\u30c3\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30ea\u30a2, Airesu Patoba Aressandoria)\nVoiced by: Katsuhisa H\u014dki\nOne of Borcuse's elite guards and commanders. He is the oldest among Borcuse's inner circle. Iris is the first of Borcuse's inner circle to die as he was killed by Girge in an ambush after he and the rest of Borcuse's army escapes their first battle with General Baldr's army. Iris rides a customized white golem whose primary weapon is a heavy quart battle-ax.\nNike (\u30cb\u30b1\uff08\u30cb\u30fc\u30ca\u30b1\u30e9\u30fb\u30c9\u30eb\u30cd\u30a4\uff09, Nike (N\u012bnakera Dorunei))\nVoiced by: Ryoko Shiraishi (Japanese); Melissa Davis (English)\nOne of Borcuse's elite guards and one of the two female commanders in his inner circle besides Leto. Despite looking like a child, Nike is actually 25 years old. While she display a look of a sweet, innocent girl, in reality she is a sadistic killer who will not hesitate to kill anyone who angers her, whether they be enemy or ally. Io is the only one who can calm Nike as he treats her like a little sister. Nike's Golem is the heavy mech Giratos, whose primary weapon is a pair of bladed arm shields, which when paired with the golem's enhanced arm strength allows it to crush and split enemy golems in half. This was what she uses to kill General True in the series.

The game ended with a score of 22-0. The LSU Tigers protested the game to the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and alleged that Tulane had used a professional player during the game. Several months later, the SIAA ruled the game an 11-0 forfeit in favor of LSU.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Amman Civil Airport (IATA: ADJ, ICAO: OJAM), commonly known as Marka International Airport, is located in Marka district, Greater Amman Municipality, Jordan, some 5 km north-east of Amman city center.\nIt serves as Amman's a main civil airport for passengers on chartered flights and VIP private flights, and moreover as an aviation education and training hub. It was the main airport for Jordan until Queen Alia International Airport was opened in 1983.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe airport was founded in 1950 by the British as a joint military civilian airport. In 2009, Jordan Airports Company officially assumed managerial and operational responsibility for Amman Civil Airport. The company is also entrusted with the development of 6,000 Dunums around Queen Alia International Airport. It mainly serves now as a regional airport servicing domestic and nearby international routes, as well as charter and private VIP flights. In coordination with international specialized consultants, the company has prepared a comprehensive master plan for Amman Civil Airport, which includes several capital projects. The company began the implementation of the first phase of the master plan to develop the facilities at the Airport; in 2012 the VIP Lounge was renovated and operated in a new spirit and a new level of services to position it as one of the most exceptional VIP Terminals in the region. In 2013 the new airport entrance project was delivered and in October 2013 the works started to rehabilitate the arrivals terminal and expand the duty-free shops at the airport, in addition to other several infrastructure and air side projects. The airport is the home to airlines such as Royal Wings, Jordan Aviation, Arab Wings, and Petra Airlines, and is operational 24 hours a day.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\nJordan International Air Cargo is based in Marka. The company was founded in 2001, and gained its Air operator's certificate in 2005. The company operates cargo charter flights in the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Europe, using two planes, one Antonov An-12 and two Ilyushin Il-76MF.\n\n\n== Historical Airlines and Destinations(1983) ==\n\n\n== Accidents ==\nOn 9 September 1956, a Jordan International Airlines Curtiss C-46A-45-CU Commando, registration JY-ABV, crashed into a downhill near the airport while trying to make an emergency landing following mechanical failures during climb out. The plane caught fire and all, but 1 passenger survived the accident.\nOn 22 January 1959, Air Jordan Flight 601, a Convair Convair CV-240-2 registration JY-ACB, crashed 2.8 mls Northwest Of Wadi-es-Sir while approaching the airport in adverse weather conditions. All 5 crew members and 6 of the 11 passengers died in the accident making it the worst civilian plane crash in Jordan's soil. The cause was determined as the pilot's decision to fly below the minimum prescribed altitude to make visual contact with the ground in adverse weather conditions.\nOn 30 June 1973, Aeroflot Armenia Flight 512, a Tupolev 134A registration CCCP-65668, overshot the runway and hit a house during take off from the airport killing 2 crew members and 7 people from the building, the other 5 crew members and 78 passengers survived. The cause was determined as the crew's decision to abort the take off at a speed of 265 km/h because the captain had the impression that the speed dropped due to the failure of one engine.\nOn 23 September 1977, a Learjet 36A operated by Arab Wings, registration JY-AFC, impacted the ground in an inverted position on hard ground approximately 8 feet north of the parallel taxiway due to fuel imbalance during take off. All 4 on board were killed.\nOn 1 May 2006, a Royal Jordanian Air Academy Piper Pa-28-181 stalled and crashed while trying to make an emergency landing to runway 06 when the plane's engine lost power during initial climb. Both pilots and their passenger died as a result of the crash.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nAccident history for ADJ at Aviation Safety Network\nCurrent weather for OJAM at NOAA/NWS",

Around 1984 he changed from being a full-time minister to becoming a self-employed investor, and many of his investment clients and victims were also Scientologists.\n\n\n== Ponzi scheme ==\nFrom 1986 to 2001, Slatkin raised approximately $593 million from about 800 wealthy investors. Using the funds from later investors, he paid one group of early investors $279M on their original $128M investment, citing investment success without actually making most of the claimed investments. He also distributed millions in fees to associates as \"consultants\". He successfully sustained the scheme until 2001, when it was shut down by an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In May 2001, the SEC shut down Slatkin's scheme by filing an enforcement action and obtaining a temporary restraining order freezing his remaining assets. On the same day as the SEC action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed search warrants relating to Slatkin.\nThe civil case was brought by the SEC in SEC v. Slatkin, Civil Action No. 01-04823 (C.D. Cal.). The criminal case was brought by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California in U.S. v. Reed E. Slatkin, CR 02-313 (C.D. Cal.).\nAmong his victims were actors Joe Pantoliano, Anne Archer and Giovanni Ribisi (the latter two being Scientologists), producers Art Linson (father of high-ranking Scientologist Jenny Linson) and Armyan Bernstein, and two additional Scientologists, film composer Mark Isham and commentator Greta Van Susteren. as well as key people of EarthLink, including Gregory B. Abbott and Scientologist Sky Dayton. He funneled millions of dollars to the Church of Scientology and their related entities.\n\n\n== Guilty plea and post-conviction ==\nSlatkin pleaded guilty to mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice and on September 2, 2003, he was sentenced to fourteen years in federal prison.\nHis Federal Bureau of Prisons registration number was 24057-112 and he was initially incarcerated at the Taft Community Correctional Institution in Taft, California. By 2010, he had been transferred to the Lompoc Federal Correctional Institution in Lompoc, California.\nMany of his victims were also Scientologists. In his fraud case, his lawyers blamed his behavior on Scientology; but Scientology's lawyers from Latham & Watkins characterized Slatkin's explanations as \"shameful\" and having \"sold the psychiatrists a bill of goods\".\nIn July 2013, he was released from a halfway house in Long Beach, California.\nOn June 23, 2015, journalist Tony Ortega reported on his website that Slatkin had died from a heart attack. Ortega said that he had confirmation of Slatkin's death from Slatkin's ex-wife.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn February 2008, the television show American Greed featured the Slatkin case, which it titled \"Stealing $$$ from Scientologists\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCNBC (February 20, 2008). \"Stealing $$$ From Scientologists and the Art of Fraud\".

Since the mid-1980s, one of the most remarkable advances in tall building design has been their construction to unprecedented slenderness ratios.\nThe now defunct New York City Board of Estimate banned these type of structures from many residential zoning districts in New York City in 1983, after residents objected to their construction. The resurgence of the real estate market there prior to the economic downturn of 2008 led to a resurgence of these buildings, now constructed in commercial districts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSliver (film)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlots & Plans article on The Austrian Cultural Forum on 52nd Street, New York, NY, USA.\nCurbed blog article on proposed sliver building at 785 8th Av., New York, NY, USA.\nNew York Times article on sliver buildings from March 18, 2007",

            "content": "Bugarach (French pronunciation: \u200b[by\u0261a\u0281a\u0283]; Burgarag in Occitan) is a commune in the Aude department in southern France, around 35 km south of Carcassonne. The economy is based on agriculture and tourism, attracting many New Age adherents.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBugarach is at the foot of Pic de Bugarach, a 1,230 metres (4,040 ft) mountain peak and the highest summit in the Corbi\u00e8res mountains. The peak is also called the \"upside down mountain\" as the top layers of rock are older than the lower layers due to uplift of the Pyrenees.\nIt is also located on the Green Meridian.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe location is mentioned for the first time as Villa Burgaragio in 889 AD; it derives from the German name Burghar and name \"Bugari\" of the Bulgarian Bogomilis in medieval France. In the 18th century the village became known for manufacturing wooden tools and hats. In modern times many esoteric and UFO legends have been connected to this place.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe major economic activity of the village and surrounding region is agriculture and tourism. Demand for holiday cottages and popularity with New Age followers led to a rise in real estate prices.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Cult settlements ==\nIn the 1960s and 70s Pic de Bugarach became popular with the hippie movement. Later in the 20th century it became popular with New Age followers who believed the \"upside down mountain\" had mystical powers, spreading to the belief that the village would be spared in the 2012 apocalypse.\nCult followers believe aliens reside inside the mountain and will spare any humans that decide to leave the planet with them in the coming apocalypse. In 2011, the number of visitors doubled to over 20,000 and France's cult watchdog, Miviludes, placed the village under scrutiny due to concern over possible mass suicides. The mayor even considered calling the army over concerns caused by this issue.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the Aude department\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE statistics",

            "content": "The St Hilary transmitting station is a facility for telecommunications situated close to the village of St Hilary, Glamorgan in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, in the UK. It comprises a 229-metre (750 ft) guyed mast with antennas attached at various heights.\nQuick facts:\nIt broadcasts Heart Wales on FM, to the whole of South Wales, while also broadcasting Swansea SW Wales and South East Wales multiplexes as far out west as Swansea, and as far out east as The Downs, near St. Nicholas.\nIt\u2019s all round broadcasts areas include:\nSt. Hilary, Cowbridge, Ystradowen, Miskin, Pontyclun, Bonvilston, St. Nicholas, The Downes, Swansea, Llanelli, West of Barry, Pontypridd, Caerphilly, Mountain Ash, Llantrisant, Church Village and Talbot Green.\nIt holds the Nation Radio studios, but Nation Radio\u2019s Transmitter is located around 5 miles away, at Wenvoe.\nIt broadcasts Vale of Glamorgan Council air-band broadband to local schools and other council owned buildings. This can get up to 50mbps average up to 1 mile away, 40mbps average up to 2 miles away, and a drop to 15mbps average for 3, 4, and 5 miles away. This technology involves a white flat dish on a pole, pointing to the tower.\nIt also is used as a mobile phone mast, primarily on the EE network, beaming 100mbps 4G+ LTE services. This mobile phone signal is poor in Cowbridge though, even though you can see the mast, but EE will hopefully sort this out with some new 4G antennae, boosting the signal in areas like Cowbridge.\nIt \u2018apparently\u2019 boosts the Wenvoe\u2019s Freeview services, but this is not confirmed, as people in the local area seem to \u2018point\u2019 their aerials at it to get a better signal, and this works. So it doesn\u2019t transmit Freeview signals, but it seems to boost the Wenvoe\u2019s channels!\nHistory\nThe plan by the Independent Television Authority (ITA) to build a mast at the site was controversial (prompting a House of Lords debate in May 1957). This was due to its proximity to Rhoose Airport (now Cardiff International Airport, and ITA's initial plan for a 305 m (1,000 ft) mast on a site that itself is 125 m (410 ft) above sea level.\nObjections were noted, the mast height was eventually limited to 229 m (750 ft) and it was built in Summer 1957 to provide 405-line VHF television to south Wales and the west of England. Test transmissions commenced on 2 September 1957 on Band III channel 10 (199.75 MHz) from antennas at 340 m above sea level and the station entered broadcast service on that frequency in January 1958. The programming was initially provided by TWW.\nThe site remained on air until the closure of 405-line television in 1985.\nIn 1965, Band III channel 7 (184.75 MHz) was added to the mast, transmitting from an antenna array sited about 20 m below the existing channel 10 array. This was to carry the programmes of ITV's new Welsh ITV region initially provided by TWW, and from 1968 by Harlech Television (HTV Wales). From that point onwards, the channel 10 transmissions carried the programmes of ITV's new West region (again, initially provided by TWW, and from 1968 by HTV West). Channel 10's power output was decreased to 55 kW and the Wales-facing antennas were removed, though the e.r.p towards the West of England remained about the same as it had been previously.\nIn 1985, when 405-line TV closed, the site was re-engineered to remove the VHF television antennas. St. Hilary became just a telecommunications mast and remained so until October 2000 when Real Radio commenced FM Radio broadcasting from the site. In late 2000, DAB Digital Radio was added to the radio broadcasting repertoire initially transmitting the Cardiff & Newport multiplex on channel 11C, but with Swansea SW Wales on channel 12A commencing in February 2004.\nIn 2006 OFCOM received a proposal for a new Rock-Orientated FM station to transmit from the site, but the licence was awarded to Xfm South Wales, now Nation Radio. Nation's studios are located at the foot of the St Hilary mast, but the station's Cardiff transmitter is a few miles away at Wenvoe.\n\n\n== Services listed by frequency ==\n\n\n=== Analogue television ===\n\n\n==== 14 January 1958 - 15 February 1965 ====\n\n\n==== 15 February 1965 - 3 January 1985 ====\n\n\n=== Analogue radio (VHF FM) ===\n\n\n==== October 2000 - May 2014 ====\n\n\n==== May 2014 - present day ====\n\n\n=== Digital Radio (DAB) ===\n\n\n==== October 2000 - 31 January 2004 ====\n\n\n==== February 2004 - present day ====\n\n\n== See also ==\nRadio masts and towers\nList of tallest buildings and structures in Great Britain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMB21's page on 405 TV to Wales and the West\n\"405 Alive's list of transmitters\"\nMore details on 405-line ITV transmitters",

            "content": "St Katharine Cree is a Church of England church in the Aldgate ward of the City of London, on the north side of Leadenhall Street near Leadenhall Market. It was founded in 1280. The present building dates from 1628\u201330. Formerly a parish church, it is now a guild church.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Former building ===\nThe parish served by the church existed by 1108, when it was served by the Augustinian Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate, also called Christ Church, which was founded by Maud, queen at the time of King Henry I. The parishioners used the priory church but this proved unsatisfactory and disruptive to the priory's activities.\nThe prior partly resolved the problem in 1280 by founding St Katharine Cree as a separate church for the parishioners. The site of the present church was originally in the priory's churchyard and it is possible that the church began as a cemetery chapel. It took its name from the priory, \"Cree\" being a corrupted abbreviation of \"Christ Church\". It was initially served by a canon appointed by the prior but this did not prove satisfactory either, so in 1414 the church was established as a parish church in its own right. The present tower was added about 1504.\nDescribing the building at the end of the 16th century, John Stow wrote\n\n\"this church seemeth to be very old; since the building whereof the high street hath been so often raised by pavements that now men are fain to descend into the said church by divers steps, seven in number.\"\n\n\n=== Current building ===\n\nThe present church was built in 1628\u201330, retaining the Tudor tower of its predecessor. It is larger than the previous church, incorporating a piece of ground previously occupied by a cloister on the north side, and the floor level is considerably higher. The rebuilt church was consecrated by William Laud, Bishop of London on 31 January 1631. His vestments and the form of service that he used for the consecration were later held against him in his trial and conviction for heresy, when Puritans accused him of having displayed Catholic sympathies through his \"bowings and cringings.\" He is commemorated by a chapel in the church.\nThe church escaped the Great Fire of London in 1666 and suffered only minor damage in the London Blitz of the Second World War. However, structural problems required extensive restoration in 1962. It is now one of the City's Guild churches.\nSt Katharine Cree is a significant church of the Jacobean period, a time when few new churches were built. It is the only Jacobean church to have survived in London. The identity of its architect is unknown. It has a high nave, linked with the narrow aisles by arcades supported on Corinthian columns. The church is 31 yards (28 m) long and 17 yards (16 m) wide; the height to the ceiling of the nave is 37 feet (11 m).\n\nThe chancel has a rose window, reputedly modelled on the much larger one in Old St Paul's Cathedral (destroyed in the Great Fire). The window and its stained glass are original, dating from 1630. The baptismal font dates from around 1640. The vaulted ceiling bears bosses of the arms of the City's livery companies; this dates mostly from the restoration of 1962. The church is a Grade I listed building.\nBy the south wall of St Katharine's is a memorial to HMT Lancastria, a troopship lost at sea during the Second World War in 1940. It includes a model of the ship and the ship's bell.\nSt Katharine's has a ring of six bells. Lester and Pack of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast five of them including the treble bell in 1754. Thomas II Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the tenor bell in 1842. The church clock has a bell, also cast by Lester and Pack in 1754. In the summer of 2007 they were rung for the first time since 1880. An appeal to raise \u00a360,000 to restore the bells to full ringing order was launched in November 2007, and he project was completed in 2009. It is the only tower in the City where the bells are rung from a ground floor ringing chamber.\nToday St Katharine's is a guild church and has no parish, but chose some years ago to dedicate its ministry to the worlds of finance, commerce and industry. The guild vicar is also Rector of St Olave Hart Street.\n\n\n== Notable people associated with the church ==\n\nStephen Charnock (1628\u201380), Puritan Presbyterian clergyman and theologian, was born in the parish.\nHans Holbein the Younger's grave (died 1543) has been claimed by both St Andrew Undershaft church and by St Katharine Cree. St Katharine Cree's claim is stronger because the nearby abbey had been recently destroyed, while St Andrew Undershaft's graveyard was already full.\nBoth Henry Purcell and George Frideric Handel played the organ at the church.\nSir Nicholas Throckmorton (died 1571) is buried in the church.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of buildings that survived the Great Fire of London\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlberge, Dalya (21 December 2016). \"London church to be reunited with stolen 16th-century carving\".

He was also seen in the first episode of Out of Jimmy's Head. He fondly remembered George Clooney, and how George was so polite and called him \"Mr. Bliss\" and offered him food on the set of Intolerable Cruelty, in which they both appeared.\nBliss played Mr. Pickering in the TV series Andy Richter Controls the Universe.\nHe guest starred as a character called Emile in an episode of TV series Get Smart called Bronzefinger.\nHe had many stories to tell of his life's adventures, and was a very talented actor. During some of his storytelling, he told us he was born to acting parents in Peoria, Illinois, but moved from time to time (Florida, New York, Europe). When he was a child, acting on the stage with his parents, they rarely told others of their true profession of acting, because it was \"looked down upon in those days.\"\nJohn died on February 28, 2008 from complications of aortic aneurysm. He was 77.\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Bliss on IMDb\nJohn Bliss at AllMovie",

Funding of $NZ39.9 million was announced by the fifth National government in March 2009.\nThe class features a new white livery with the KiwiRail logo.\nDue to passenger loadings falling on both South Island trains as a result of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, three AK, one AKC, one AKL and one AKV were transferred to the North Island for the new three-times-a-week Auckland-Wellington Northern Explorer.\nIn September 2017, work on two AG vans commenced for conversion to AKV vans\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe class was designed by KiwiRail's mechanical design staff in Wellington. It has GPS-triggered announcements, with displays on ceiling-mounted screens and commentary at each seat in five languages: English, French, German, Japanese and Mandarin. It runs on newly designed air-cushioned P11 bogies. Seating was supplied by a Wellington-based manufacturer.\nWith large panoramic windows and quarter lights in the roof, the area of glass per AK car is 52 m2 (560 sq ft). To one side of each seat is a jack for headphones for the on-board commentary, and in front of each seat is a flip-down tray table. Seats facing each other in groups of four are positioned around a fixed table. Power points are provided at each seat area. Carry-on baggage can be stored overhead.\n\n\n== Class register ==\n\nThe class include the following sub-types: AK saloon car and AKC licensed caf\u00e9 car, supplemented by AKL luggage van and AKV outdoor observation/generator car.\nAK 2151 was planned, but built as AKC 2552. AK 2168 was planned, but not built.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKiwiRail Express 19 May 2010\nHillside's $40m contract 15 May 2010 Otago Daily Times\nKiwiRail website\nKiwiRail Scenic website\nP11 Bogie Design Case Study",

            "content": "Henry George Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford, KC (24 June 1892 \u2013 28 August 1974) was a British lawyer and a Conservative politician.\n\n\n== Background and education ==\nHe was born at 19 Pembridge Gardens, Kensington, London, on 24 June 1892. He was the only son of Alphonse Henry Strauss, general merchant, and his wife, Hedwig Aschrott. He was educated at Rugby and Christ Church, Oxford, and was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1919.  He shortly served during World War I, but was discharged because of health problems and continued working in a Whitehall.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nStrauss sat as Member of Parliament for Norwich between 1935 and 1945, for the Combined English Universities between 1946 and 1950 and for Norwich South between 1950 and 1955. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Attorney General, Sir Donald Somervell, between 1936 and 1942 and a government member as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works between March and December 1942 and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning between 1942 and 1945, when he resigned from the government in protest at Churchill's treatment of Poland at the Yalta agreement. He was once again a government member as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade under Churchill between 1951 and 1955. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Conesford, of Chelsea in the County of London.\nIn 1946 he published the book Trade Unions and the Law connected with treatment of Poland by Yalta agreements. From 1964 - 1970 he was the Chairman of the Association of Independent Unionist Peers. He also was the President of the Architectural club. \nLord Conesford became a King's Counsel in 1964 and a Bencher of the Inner Temple in 1969. He was also a member of the governors of Norwich High School for Girls and a vice-president of the Girls' Day School Trust. He was well known for his speeches in which he complained about the improper usages of the English language, especially in the United States as can be seen in this Time Magazine article from 1957.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nLord Conesford married Anne Sadelbia Mary, daughter of John Bowyer Buchanan Nichols, in 1927. He died in August 1974, aged 82, when the barony became extinct.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHansard 1803\u20132005: contributions in Parliament by Henry Strauss",

Founded in 1965 as TJ Iskra Partiz\u00e1nske, it took its current name in 1997. It currently competes in the WHIL.\nAfter debuting in the Czechoslovak Championship in 1975, Iskra rose to the top between 1979 and 1981, winning in this period two championships, one national cup and most notably the 1980 IHF Cup Winners' Cup, beating Lokomotiva Zagreb in the final on penalties. As of 2013 it remains the only EHF women's trophy won by a Slovak team, as well as the only Cup Winners' Cup won by a team from former Czechoslovakia. Iskra won two more Czechoslovak championships in 1985 and 1988, and in 1992 it reached the IHF Cup's final, lost to HC Leipzig.\nFollowing the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the team won its only Slovak championship to date in 1994, followed by two national cups in 1995 and 1999. The following decade wasn't successful and Sl\u00e1via's fourth cup came in 2011. The following year it made it into the Slovak championship's three top teams for the first time since 1996.\n\n\n== Titles ==\nEHF Cup Winners' Cup (1)\n1980\n\nCzechoslovak Championship (4)\n1980, 1981, 1985, 1988\n\nSlovak Extraliga (1)\n1994\n\nSlovak Cup (4)\n1979, 1995, 1999, 2011\n\n\n== References ==",

It is responsible to the national Central Police Directorate for Crime Prevention (Italian: Direzione Centrale della Polizia di Prevenzione, DCPP), which is a part of the Public Safety Department of the Interior Ministry. The DIGOS, which has an Office in each provincial headquarters, or Questura, of the Polizia di Stato acts as its Intelligence branch. Through \"general investigations\" aimed at having a constant eye on the evolution on national soil of social unrest, political underground movements and sports-related violent phenomena the DIGOS periodically reports to the Minister of Interior and to the Head of Police. Such activity is strongly assisted by the peculiar and specially trained infiltration units belonging to DIGOS that constantly enrich such reports and investigations with \"inside views\" of the various phenomena (hence the \"special operations\" part of the acronym General Investigations and Special Operations Division or DIGOS). Special training of such units involves classes on local slang, specific environment habits and social camouflage along with prior real life experiences as a selection preference).\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Labyrinth of the World and Paradise of the Heart is a book by John Amos Comenius. The book is a satirical allegory. Considered a jewel of baroque literature, it is one of the author's most important works. Comenius finished the first version in 1623, but he rewrote the book several times, changing its concept and form. The book remains the most widely read work of older Czech literature.\nThe world is portrayed as a city which resembles a labyrinth, entered by a pilgrim (the narrator and author himself). The city has The Gate of Entering, and The Gate of Separation; six main streets which represent the six classes of the world; The Castle of Fortune in its middle; and The Common Square.\nIn Part One of the book, Labyrinth of the World (Chapters 1\u201336), the pilgrim is joined by two guides, Searchall Ubiquitous (allegory of human curiosity and longing for knowledge), and Delusion (allegory of indolent adopting of conventional and shallow thoughts). He seeks a job for himself that would best suit both his body and soul. The guides, however, prevent the pilgrim from seeing reality by making him watch the world through glasses. He captures glimpses of the reality only seldom. That is why he cannot find the right choice; even in the Castle of Wisdom he sees Vanity.\nHe sees human life as meaningless, and is terrified by death; yet he finds salvation in Part Two of the book, Paradise of the Heart (Chapters 37\u201354), where he returns to his heart, being called there by God. There he is visited by Christ who tells him what the real meaning of the world is, so the pilgrim, now transformed, can join the Invisible Church and see it through new glasses which are the word of God and the Holy Spirit. He finally beholds the Glory of God and is received among God's own. For this, he thanks with a prayer and a hymn that celebrates the Glory, Beauty and Love of God.\nThe book is written in an artistic language. It is a poetical vision, and Comenius doesn't just criticize society, he also tries to capture the progress of Man in general (and show the dualism of material and spiritual ways of life). He points at the vanity of human endeavour that focuses on the material world and tells the reader that one must follow the will of God, as it is revealed in the Bible.\nAs mentioned above, the book remains very popular and is still in print (so far the last two editions in the Czech Republic appeared in 2001, which was sold out very soon, and 2005. The new Moravian Library building which was opened in Brno on 2 April 2001 has a stone relief of the Labyrinth on its front wall.\n\n\n== External links and references ==\n\nThe book in English",

            "content": "Martha Hopkins Struever (1931\u20132017) was an American Indian art dealer, author, and leading scholar on historic and contemporary Pueblo Indian pottery and Pueblo and Navajo Indian jewelry. In June 2015, a new gallery in the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, was named for her. The first permanent museum gallery devoted to Native American jewelry, the Martha Hopkins Struever Gallery, is part of the Center for the Study of Southwestern Jewelry.\n\n\n== Early personal life and education ==\nStruever was born in 1931 in Milan, Indiana, the only child of Lester Harper Hopkins, M.D. and Eva Montalie (Neill) Hopkins. She grew up in rural southeastern Indiana in Versailles. After obtaining her Bachelor of Science degree from Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana in 1953, Struever attended the Tob\u00e9-Coburn School For Fashion Careers (now the Wood Tob\u00e9 Coburn School) in New York City. On November 16, 1953 she married Richard Burnham Lanman, Sr. of Hammond, Indiana with whom she had two sons: Richard Burnham Lanman, M.D. and Todd Hopkins Lanman, M.D. She was widowed when Richard Sr. died of leukemia on December 8, 1966. Martha married Edgar Allen \"Bud\" Cusick in 1971 and divorced in 1988.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAfter being widowed, Struever began collecting and dealing in American Indian art. In 1970 she visited San Ildefonso Pueblo and purchased her first piece, a \"gun metal sheen\" pottery plate by Maria Montoya Martinez and her son Popovi Da. In 1976, she established the Indian Tree Gallery in Chicago, Illinois featuring historic and contemporary American Indian jewelry, pottery, Kachina dolls, weavings, and paintings. In order to bring the best Southwestern Indian artists to her Chicago gallery, she visited the Pueblo and Navajo reservations (often alone) to begin what were to become lifelong relationships with such prominent artists such as Charles Loloma, the foremost American Indian jeweler, and Dextra Quotskuyva, the pre-eminent contemporary Hopi potter. Martha helped many Indian artists gain exposure outside of Southwestern markets by sponsoring shows for them in Chicago. Martha hosted Maria Martinez at her Chicago gallery in 1977 - and arranged a special reception at the Chicago Art Institute for the then 96-year-old potter. In addition to prominent artists, a primary focus of Martha's career has been the identification and encouragement of talented new Indian potters and jewelers. Martha sponsored the first exhibitions of now-notable jewelers Gail Bird and Yazzie Johnson, Richard Chavez, Norbert Peshlaki, and Perry Shorty, as well as potters Dextra Quotskuyva, Steve Lucas and Les Namingha.\nOn November 12, 1988, Struever married noted archaeologist Stuart M. Struever and relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. By 2006, she was recognized as the \"grande dame\" of American Indian art dealers, and received the first Lifetime Achievement Award from the Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association \"for contributions to the understanding and preservation of tribal art\".\nOver the past thirty years, Struever conducted over sixty traveling art and archaeology seminars throughout Navajo and Pueblo lands. Her seminars were enriched by her relationships with the many Indian artists whose careers she has encouraged.\nStruever's philanthropic work included overseeing nine Indian Art Shows in Chicago, Washington, DC, and Denver, bringing 25 artists to each event, for the benefit of the nonprofit Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. Crow Canyon was founded by her husband, Stuart Struever.\nIn addition to her two sons, she had seven grandchildren, and one grandchild, when she passed away on September 24, 2017.\n\n\n== Publications and scholarly work ==\nStruever published reference works, authoring the two books \"Loloma: Beauty Is His Name\" (Wheelwright Museum, 2006) and \"Painted Perfection: The Pottery of Dextra Quotskuyva\" (Wheelwright Museum, 2002), as well as museum catalogues entitled \"Nampeyo: A Gift Remembered\" (Kendall College, Mitchell Museum, 1984), \"Hopi Art: A Century of Continuity and Change\" (San Francisco Museum of Craft and Folk Art, 1987), and \"Legends of Pueblo Pottery\" (Wheelwright Museum, 1997). She has guest curated museum exhibitions in several cities. As Struever's scholarly reputation has grown, she has become recognized as one of the foremost experts on the pottery of Nampeyo, the jewelry of Loloma and the works of other significant Southwestern Indian artists.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMartha Hopkins Struever home page\nMitchell Museum of the American Indian\nMuseum of New Mexico\nWheelwright Museum of the American Indian",

            "content": "The English Football League One Play-offs are a series of play-off matches, contested by the teams finishing from 3rd to 6th in the EFL League One table to determine the third spot for promotion to the second tier of English football, the Championship.\nThe latest team to win the League One Play-Offs were Millwall defeating Bradford City 1-0 at Wembley\nThe record attendance for a League One Play-off final at Wembley was the 1999 final, when Manchester City played Gillingham and the attendance stood at 76,935.\n\n\n== Name changes ==\n\n\n== Format ==\nThe current system of the League One play-offs uses two semi-finals played over two legs, with 6th playing 3rd and 5th playing 4th, with the return fixtures following. For the two-legged semi-finals, there is no away goals advantage such as those in the knock-out rounds of European competition. The Final is played at Wembley, although from 2001 to 2006, it was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff while Wembley was being rebuilt.\nAside from the branding changes which affected English football in 1992 and 2004, the League One play-offs have also changed in format. The last alteration occurred in 1995, when the restructuring of the league meant 2nd to 5th contested the play-offs.\nWhen they started in 1987, the play-offs originally featured a second-tier team and three third-tier clubs. This format was continued for 1988, but discontinued afterwards. The first winners of the playoffs at this level were Swindon Town, who were promoted to the Second Division in 1987 at the expense of Gillingham, who had already condemned Sunderland to the Third Division for the first time in their history.\nA year later, Walsall were promoted, defeating Sheffield United, who were relegated as a result.\nThe final was originally held over two legs, but both the 1987 and 1988 finals went to a third match at Selhurst Park and Fellows Park respectively. In 1989, the playoffs were two-legged affairs featuring the third, fourth, fifth and sixth place teams, with Port Vale being the successful side on this occasion.\nFrom 1990, the final has been a single-match affair, being held at Wembley, or the Millennium Stadium between 2001 and 2006, apart from the 2011 final, which was moved to Old Trafford as Wembley was in use for the Champions League Final. The first winners of the one-match final were Notts County, who went on to win the Second Division playoff final a year later.\nThe first team to win promotion from the third tier via the playoffs on more than one occasion were Walsall, who won promotion in 1988 and again in 2001 via this route. Peterborough United (1992 and 2011), Huddersfield Town (1995 and 2012) and Millwall (2010 and 2017) have since matched this.\n\n\n== Past winners ==\n\n\n== Records ==\nNote: These are only for play-offs at League One level, for overall records in the Football League play-offs see here.\nMost play-off promotions: 2 \u2013 Walsall (1988, 2001), Peterborough United (1992, 2011), Huddersfield Town (1995, 2012), Barnsley (2006, 2016), Millwall (2010, 2017)\nMost play-off participations: 7 \u2013 Brentford (1991, 1995, 1997, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2013), Huddersfield Town (1992, 1995, 2002, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012)\nMost unsuccessful play-off participations: 7 \u2013 Brentford (from 7 in total)\nTeams without any unsuccessful play-off participations: West Bromwich Albion (1993), Burnley (1994), Grimsby Town (1998), Manchester City (1999), Brighton & Hove Albion (2004), Sheffield Wednesday (2005), Barnsley (2006, 2016), Doncaster Rovers (2008) and Rotherham United (2014)\nBiggest aggregate win: Barnsley 6-1 Walsall (2016)\nBiggest home win: Doncaster Rovers 5\u20131 Southend United (Semi-final, 2008)\nBiggest away win: Fulham 0\u20134 Bristol Rovers (Semi-final, 1989)\nBiggest win in a final: Preston North End 4\u20130 Swindon Town (2015)\nHighest scoring final: 6 goals \u2013 Hartlepool United 2\u20134 Sheffield Wednesday (2005)\nHighest scoring play-off match: 10 goals \u2013 Swindon Town 5\u20135 Sheffield United (Semi-final, 2015)\nHighest scoring tie (aggregate): 13 goals \u2013 Swindon Town 7\u20136 Sheffield United (2015)\nHighest attendance: 76,935 \u2013 Gillingham vs Manchester City (Final, 1999)\nLowest attendance: 4,931 \u2013 Crewe Alexandra vs Notts County (Semi-final, 1996)\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Westmoreland House is an abandoned building at Nos. 104\u2013106 Stokes Croft, Bristol, next door to the Carriage Works.\nThe building was opened in January 1966 by Lady Westmorland (wife of David Fane, 15th Earl of Westmorland) which it was named after. It was built to house the headquarters of the Spastics League Club, a bonus scheme affiliated with the Spastics Society where members could receive weekly gifts. The club and headquarters closed in 1982 after they were unable to pay a \u00a3250,000 tax bill, and the building has not been legally occupied since.\nSince the closure of the Spastics League Club, Westmoreland House has become increasingly derelict and a popular place for graffiti artists to display artwork. This has led to English Heritage classifying the whole Stokes Croft conservation area \"at risk\". The premises was bought by Comer Homes for redevelopment in 1989, but plans stalled after they were unable to agree with the city council on how to proceed. The building was planned to be redeveloped by the South West Regional Development Agency, but plans were cancelled in 2009 following budget cuts.\nIn 2014, the Mayor of Bristol announced Westmoreland House would be demolished, while the neighbouring Carriage Works would be spared and turned into flats as it is a Grade II listed building. Local residents, who enjoy the diversity and anticommercial nature of Stokes Croft were unimpressed with the plans and hoped something more insipring could be designed. Campaign material against the redevelopment was posted to the front of Westmoreland House, including a hand-painted sign on the former main entrance that reads \"No to luxury flats \u2013 yes to affordable homes\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCarriage Works \u2013 includes history and details on the Carriage Works and Westmoreland House\nWestmoreland House \u2013 images of the derelict structure, with graffiti artwork",

            "content": "The Mexican free-tailed bat or Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) is a medium-sized bat that is native to the Americas, regarded as one of the most abundant mammals in North America. Its proclivity towards roosting in huge numbers at relatively few locations makes it vulnerable to habitat destruction in spite of its abundance. The bat is considered a species of special concern in California as a result of declining populations. It has been claimed to have the fastest horizontal speed (as opposed to stoop diving speed) of any animal, reaching top ground speeds of over 160 km/h; its actual air speed has not been measured.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nMolecular sequence data indicates T. brasiliensis's closest relatives are the sister species Sauromys petrophilus of South Africa and Tadarida aegyptiaca of Africa and south Asia. These three species form a clade believed to be about 6.5 million years old.\n\n\n== Physical description ==\nMexican free-tailed bats are on average 9 cm (3.5 in) in length and weigh approximately 7\u201312 g (0.25\u20130.42 oz) with females tending to be slightly heavier than males by one or two grams for increased fat storage to use during gestation and nursing. Their tail is almost half their total length and stretches beyond the uropatagium, giving them the name \"free-tailed\" bats. Their ears are wide, rounded, and large compared to their head, nearly meeting at the front of the face but distinctly not joined at the midline and projecting anterodorsally from just before the muzzle to the back of the head. They use their large ears to help them find prey using echolocation. T. brasiliensis is distinguished among North American Tadarida bats in possessing deep wrinkles on the upper lip and in having a Z-shaped upper third molar which is used for grinding insects. These individuals possess canines which are larger in males than in females. The wings are elongated and narrow with pointed tips, making them well-equipped for quick, straight flight patterns. Their fur color ranges from dark brown to gray. The Mexican free-tailed bat's large feet have distinct long, white bristles. The dental formula of Tadarida brasiliensis is 1.1.1.33.1.2.3.\n\n\n== Range and ecology ==\n\nThe Mexican free-tailed bat ranges from the southern half of the continental United States through most of Mexico, and through most of Central America into South America. The range of the Mexican free-tailed bat in South America is less understood where it lives in the eastern Brazilian highlands and coast, the northeastern Andes and the coast of Peru and northern Chile. It is absent in much of the Amazon rainforest. The bat is also found in the Caribbean, and is native to all of the Greater Antilles and 11 of the Lesser Antilles. The largest known colony is found at Bracken Cave, north of San Antonio, Texas, with nearly 20 million bats; research indicates the bats from this colony congregate in huge numbers at altitudes between 180 and 1,000 m (590 and 3,280 ft), and even as high as 3,000 m (9,800 ft).\n\n\n=== Habitat ===\nMexican free-tailed bats roost primarily in caves. However, they will also roost in buildings of any type as long as they have access to openings and dark recesses in ceilings or walls. The bats can make roosting sites of buildings regardless of \"age, height, architecture, construction materials, occupancy by humans and compass orientation\". Caves, on the other hand, need to have enough wall and ceiling space to fit millions of bats. Before buildings, free-tailed bats in the southeastern United States probably roosted in the hollows of trees such as red mangrove, black mangrove, white mangrove and cypress. However, most bats in Florida seem to prefer buildings and other man-made structures over natural roosts. Caves in Florida tend to be occupied mostly by the southeastern myotis. Caves in Florida tend to have pools of water on the floor and the free-tailed bats do not need as much relative humidity as the southeastern myotis.\n\n\n=== Migration ===\n\nMexican free-tailed bats in southeastern Nevada, southwestern Utah, western Arizona and southeastern California come together to migrate southwest to southern California and Baja California. Bats in southeastern Utah, southwestern Colorado, western New Mexico and eastern Arizona travel though western edge of the Sierra Madre Oriental into Jalisco, Sinaloa and Sonora. Some bats that summer in Kansas, Oklahoma, eastern New Mexico and Texas will migrate southward to southern Texas and Mexico. Some bat populations in other areas of North America do not migrate, but are residents and may make seasonal changes in roost sites. While this migration is extremely extensive, there has to be a way that these bats continuously congregate in the same roosts every year. Tadarida brasiliensis have copious amounts of sebaceous glands covering their entire bodies. These glands leave a trace of a lasting scent that other bats are sensitive to. This odor that is left is crucial to marking habitual roosts. \n\nIn Austin, Texas, a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats summers (they winter in Mexico) under the Congress Avenue Bridge ten blocks south of the Texas State Capitol. It is the largest urban colony in North America, with an estimated 1,500,000 bats. Each night they eat 10,000 to 30,000 lb (4,500 to 13,600 kg) of insects. Each year they attract 100,000 tourists who come to watch them. In Houston, Texas, a colony is living under the Waugh Street Bridge over Buffalo Bayou. It is the home to 250,000 bats and also attracts viewers. The Mexican free-tailed bat is the official flying mammal of the state of Texas.\nBats ranging eastward from East Texas do not migrate, but local shifts in roost usage often occur seasonally. Also, a regional population that ranges from Oregon to California, has a year-round residence.\n\n\n=== Diet ===\nMexican free-tailed bats are primarily insectivores. They hunt their prey using echolocation. The bats eat moths, beetles, dragonflies, flies, true bugs, wasps, and ants. Bats usually catch flying prey in flight. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats fly hundreds of meters above the ground in Texas to feed on migrating insects. The consumption of insects by these bats can be quite significant.\nThe onset of evening emergence from caves and the end of returns at dawn tend to correlate with sunset and sunrise, respectively, with dawn returns ending increasingly later in correlation to sunrise throughout the summer season. Reproductive females tended to emerge earlier in the evening and return later at dawn in order to gather the extra nutrients they require for reproduction and offspring care. T. brasiliensis bats spend around 60% of their active time foraging while aerial, mostly hunting at heights of 6\u201315 m (20\u201349 ft). Individuals will fly 50 km (31 mi) in one night to reach foraging areas. The loose, wrinkled skin around the mouth is thought to aid in expanding the mouth during flight to catch insects. T. brasiliensis requires free water sources to maintain water balance: individuals from the arid environment of New Mexico tend to have thicker renal tissue layers compared to T. brasiliensis from the less arid California, revealing that urine concentrating abilities and water use varies geographically with aridity. \n\n\n=== Health and mortality ===\nOne individual bat was recorded to have lived eight years, based on dentition. Predators of the bat include large birds such as red-tailed hawk, American kestrels, great horned owls, barn owls, and Mississippi kites. Mammal predators include Virginia opossums, striped skunks, and raccoons. Snakes such as eastern coachwhips and eastern coral snakes may also prey on them, but at a lesser extent. Certain types of beetles prey on neonate and juvenile bats that have fallen to the ground. This species seems to have a low incidence of rabies, at least in the United States. They do, however, contain certain pesticides.\nWhite-nose syndrome (WNS) caused by infection by the fungus P. destructans has increased in prevalence since 2006, mostly affecting species of bats that roost underground such as the little brown bat. The fungus, now suspected to have spread from accidental transportation by human cave workers, is thought to cause frequent arousals during bat hibernation, causing an individual to use fat stores much more quickly and die of starvation before the end of winter. WNS can affect T. brasiliensis, but has yet to be greatly introduced to their habitat due to their preference for more arid caves. WNS has low prevalence in the sub-tropic and tropic regions where T. brasiliensis resides. \n\n\n== Behavior ==\n\nMexican free-tailed bats are nocturnal foragers and begin feeding after dusk. They travel 50 km in a quick, direct flight pattern to feed. This species flies the highest among bats, at altitudes around 3300 m. Bats appear to be most active in late morning and afternoon between June and September. Free-tailed bats are more active in warm weather.\nThe species has been measured at a ground speed of 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph), measured by an aircraft tracking device. The measurement methodology did not simultaneously record wind speed and ground speed, so the observations could have been affected by strong local gusts, and the bat's maximum air speed remains uncertain.\n\n\n=== Guano and ammonia ===\nAmong bats that roost in great, concentrated numbers, T. brasiliensis roosts produce large quantities of urine and guano: anywhere from 22 to 99 metric tons per cave and over 18,700 metric tons produced annually. The concentrated large amounts of waste generate high levels of toxic ammonia in the air of a cave. T. brasiliensis individuals have genetic adaptation for withstanding or countering these high levels of ammonia. The bats\u2019 content of CO2 and protein in respiratory mucous and CO2 dissolved in blood plasma increase with increasing levels of dissolved ammonia, providing the bats with a buffer against pH change. This allows the bats to filter out a large majority of inhaled ammonia before it reaches toxic levels in the blood. T. brasiliensis bats are thought to swarm in spiraling motions within caves to ventilate ammonia and renew the air.\n\n\n=== Echolocation ===\nMexican free-tailed bats use echolocation for navigation and detecting prey. Traveling calls are of a brief but constant frequency. However, they switch modulated frequency calls between 40 and 75 kHz if they detect something. Typically, the frequency range of their echolocation is between 49 and 70 kHz, but can be between 25 and 40 kHz if something crosses their path while in flight.\nOn 6 November 2014, Aaron Corcoran, a biologist at Wake Forest University, North Carolina, reported online in Science that he and his team had detected Mexican free-tailed bats emitting ultrasonic vocalizations which had the effect of jamming the echolocation calls of a rival bat species hunting moths. The \u2018jamming\u2019 call led to an increased chance of the rival missing its prey, which the Mexican free-tailed bat was then able to eat itself. Earlier researchers had discovered some 15 types of social calls made by Mexican free-tailed bats and reported that they could adjust their calls to avoid interfering with others in range of their calls.\n\n\n=== Mating and reproduction ===\n\nDuring the breeding season, females aggregate into maternity roosts. The size of these roosts depends on the environment, with caves having the larger roosts. Mating can occur in an aggressive or passive form. In the aggressive form, the male controls the female's movements, keeping her away from the other bats in the roost. He also tends to vocalize when mating. During passive copulation, the males simply flies to a female in her roost and quietly mounts her with no resistance. This species is a promiscuous breeder and both sexes copulate with multiple partners. Females become sexually mature at about 9 months, while males take even longer, at two years. Females enter estrus once a year, which typically lasts five weeks in the spring. The gestation period of the bat lasts 11\u201312 weeks, with only one young being born. A number of pups are left in \"creches\", while their mothers roost elsewhere. The female uses vocalizations and scent to identify her pup. The mother imprints her scent on the young early on. However, young try to steal a suckle from any female that passes through the cluster. A mother will nurse her young daily, and by 4\u20137 weeks old they are full grown, fully weaned, and independent.\n\n\n== Protection ==\nThough abundant and widespread, some local populations have prompted protection and conservation efforts. For instance, during the spring and summer, one of the largest Mexican free-tailed bat populations inhabits Cueva de la Boca, a cave near Monterrey, Mexico. In 2006, the Mexican environmental conservation NGO, Pronatura Noreste, purchased the property. Because of a reduction of more than 95% of the original 20 million bat population, as a result of vandalism, pollution, and uncontrolled tourism, the organization decided to buy the property to place it under conservation. Other species of high ecological value that inhabit the cavern are also being protected.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBat bomb, an experimental incendiary weapon that used Mexican free-tailed bats as a dispersal mechanism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Data related to Tadarida brasiliensis at Wikispecies\n\"Tadarida brasiliensis\".

It is a salt that forms colorless or white water-soluble rhombic crystals and is soluble in water (108 g/100 mL) but less soluble in organic solvents.\nSodium tetrafluoroborate is used in some fluxes used for brazing and to produce Boron trifluoride.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nSodium tetrafluoroborate can be prepared by neutralizing tetrafluoroboric acid with sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.\nNaOH + HBF4 \u2192 NaBF4 + H2O\nNa2CO3 + 2 HBF4 \u2192 2 NaBF4 + H2O + CO2\nAlternatively the chemical can be synthesized from boric acid, hydrofluoric acid, and sodium carbonate:\n2H3BO3 + 8HF + Na2CO3 \u2192 2NaBF4 + 7H2O + CO2\n\n\n== Reactions and uses ==\nOn heating to its melting point, sodium tetrafluoroborate decomposes to sodium fluoride and boron trifluoride:\nNaBF4 \u2192 NaF + BF3\nIt is a source of tetrafluoroborate anion, which is used in organic chemistry for the preparation of salts. Sodium tetrafluoroborate can be used for synthesis of ionic liquids, where tetrafluoroborate is the anion.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The Hollywood Victory Committee was an organization founded on December 10, 1941 during World War II to provide a means for stage, screen, television and radio performers that were not in military service to contribute to the war effort through bond drives and improving morale for troops. It was associated with the Screen Actors Guild. The Committee organized events between January 1942 until August 1945. Chairmen of the committee included Clark Gable, James Cagney, and George Murphy. Hattie McDaniel was the Chairman of the Negro Division of the Hollywood Victory Committee, providing entertainment for soldiers in hospitals, and those stationed at military bases.\nOne of the committee's most notable successes was the Hollywood Victory Caravan which crossed the country in April / May 1942.\nWithin its four years, arranged for stars to travel five million miles to entertain soldiers. The committee's final report took credit for providing 56,037 free appearances by 4,147 persons in 7,700 events, including 13,555 playing days by 176 persons on 122 overseas tours.\nThe Hollywood Victory Committee organized Hollywood start to headline many of the variety, dramatic or musical shows provided by the USO Camp Tours. The shows were originally organized under great secrecy and sent initially to the British Isles to entertain American troops stationed there. Entertainers would eventually travel to most battle fields to provide entertainment to active duty soldiers. The Hollywood Victory Committee began December 10, 1941; the day after Pearl Harbor was attacked and would go on to provide over 56,000 free appearances by over 4,000 Hollywood stars.\nRadio broadcasts were a very important part of this entertainment since radio could reach millions of people quickly and many stars were recruited to help get out important messages on buying bonds, saving salvage scrap, or raising funds for charity. If the top names in entertainment could be used to make the announcements, participation and public reception of the projects could be elevated. There were many requests for programs, sometimes as many as five in one week, and all were met. Hollywood starts were even furnished to Canada to promote the sale of Canadian Victory Bonds.\nOne very popular program organized by the Hollywood Victory Committee was the broadcast of \u201cCommand Performance.\u201d This program was not heard by American civilians but broadcast by short-wave radio to America\u2019s fighting forces on all battle fronts. The American soldiers sent in requests for what wanted on these broadcasts and the Hollywood Victory Committee worked to furnish the Hollywood stars. Major General A.D. Surles, Director of the War Department Bureau of Public Relations said that the troops \u201csit with ears glued to the radio every Sunday.\u201d Major General Surles also wrote \u201cit may be seen that your efforts on our behalf and the many services rendered to us by you and the stars of the screen, stage and radio are not only doing a tremendous job in the entertainment of our men in service abroad, but are doing an equally important job in building goodwill for our country with international audience.\u201d \n\n\n== Beginning of the Hollywood Victory Committee ==\nClark Gable was the first chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee. He had starred in the movie Gone With the Wind in 1939 and had recently completed other films such as Boom Town with Spencer Tracy in 1940. A major star when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred in 1941. Gable was perfect to lead the patriotic movement in Hollywood.\nOne of Gable's first decisions as chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee was to enlist the aid of his wife, Carole Lombard, also s successful actress to sell war bonds. She initially traveled around Indiana, selling over $2 million in war bonds. In Indianapolis, Carole lead the crowd in the World War II cheer \"V for Victory\". Tragically, this patriotic act may have contributed to her untimely death. In a hurry to return home to her husband in California, Carole Lombard purchased seats on TWA Flight #3 from Indianapolis to Burbank. The flight made a stop for a scheduled layover in Las Vegas, and Ms. Lombard and her group were in danger of being bumped. She talked her way onto the final leg of the flight by reminding military officials that she had sold over $2 million in war bonds. In flight for only a few minutes and a short 32 miles from the airport, the DC-3 crashed into Potosi Mountain. All aboard the flight were killed.\nArmy officials offered to honor Carole with a complete military funeral but Mr. Gable chose to respect her wishes and opted for a simple, private funeral. After his wife's burial in California, Clark Gable joined the Army Air Corps and flew B-17 missions from England. Carole Lombard was recognized by the Hollywood Victory Committee as the first star to give her life in the war effort.\nPrior to World War II America adopted an isolationist policy and sought to avoid involvement in the growing conflicts in Europe. During World War I, war had become more violent and all-encompassing for those nations involved. Casualties from the new styles of war skyrocketed. Americans were disillusioned with war and they needed to be quickly convinced to join the conflict. With the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 and America\u2019s entrance into the war, something had to be done to convert America\u2019s isolationist citizens.\nOn December 18, 1941 President Roosevelt addressed Hollywood and asked them to help change Americans into supporters of the war effort. Hollywood stars were called upon to promote the sale of war bonds, raise compliance with rationing programs, explain the Land-Lease Program and encourage everyone to pay their taxes and support the war.\nClark Gable, the first chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee, encouraged his fellow actors to not only support the war effort with their talents but to actively join the military. Clark Gable, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Stewart lead by example and enlisted. Jimmy Stewart joined the Army Air Force Corps as a private and was eventually promoted to lieutenant colonel. Stewart would become a brigadier general . Hollywood stars also raised money and support for the war by participating, entertaining and selling war bonds. Actor Audi Murphy would become the most decorated war veteran of the war. Hollywood was clearly leading the way in supporting World War II through the leadership of the Hollywood Victory Committee.\nThe Hollywood Victory Committee encouraged movie theaters to also participate in the war mobilization. Theaters often became collection centers for items that needed to be recycled. Stars often lead such drives as the recycling of metals and actress Rita Hayworth even donated her car\u2019s bumpers to the scrap metal drive. Many theaters also sold war bonds from the box office. They were centers for blood donation as well and many Hollywood actors and actresses lead the way and publicly made blood donations at the theaters. Some theaters granted free admission with a blood donation. The Hollywood Victory Committed lead the way in converting Americans to become war supporters.\n\n\n== James Cagney ==\nJames Cagney, one of the great actors of Hollywood's Golden Age, was one of the early Chairmans of the Hollywood Victory Committee. Famous for his defiant comedy and vivacious presence on screen he could play a gangster as well as dance in a musical. His favorite film, Yankee Doodle Dandy. 1942 was a patriotic wartime musical that was filled with passion and support for the military. He was a close friend of Ronald Reagan, he was a family man who passionately supported his country. In 1938, as the highest paid actor in Hollywood, Cagney was accused of communist sympathies and was brought before the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. He was exonerated. Through all of this he never lost his passion for his country or his enormous appeal to his fans. During his involvement as Chairman of the Hollywood Victory Committee, James Cagney participated in long domestic and overseas tours to entertain the troops and worked tirelessly to sell war bonds.\n\n\n== George Murphy ==\nGeorge Murphy was another Chairman of the Victory Committee, and like good friends James Cagney and Ronald Reagan, he would also serve as President of the Screen Actors Guild. Like Reagan, he became active in politics after Chairing the Hollywood Victory Committee and organizing entertainment for the Armed Forces during the Second World War. Hd would serve as a senator from California for the Republican Party.\n\n\n== Hattie McDaniel ==\nHattie McDaniel, famous for her role as Mammie in Gone With the Wind, became the first African-American to win an Academy Award. Her Oscar for her role in Gone With the Wind was criticized by some since she won it playing the role of a slave. Her passion for her country and though she generally avoided politics, she became Chairwoman of the Hollywood Victory Committee's \"Negro Division\" during World War II.\n\n\n== Hollywood Victory Caravan ==\nOne of the most successful projects of the Hollywood Victory Committee was the organization of the Hollywood Victory Caravan in 1942. During a three-week cross country rail tour, performers such as Laurel and Hardy, Bing Crosby, Groucho Marx, Gary Grant, Desi Arnaz and Bob Hope participated in performances and rallies that promoted the Sale of War Bonds. This would become the USA's largest war bond tour of the Second World War. Film stars Bob Hope and Bing Crosby would keep the memory alive in the their 1945 movie about a young woman's attempt to travel to Washington DC to visit her brother who was a soldier. They played themselves in this musical comedy that was produced by Paramount Studios for the U.S. Treasury in 1945. The movie used actual home movie frames to recreate the largest bond tour of World War II. It preserves one of the most successful projects of the Hollywood Victory Committee.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nShain, Russell Earl.

As expected, Ilham Aliyev, son of the outgoing president, Heydar Aliyev, was easily elected in an election which international observers held not to be free or fair.\n\n\n== Conduct ==\nHuman Rights Watch claimed that \"the government has heavily intervened in the campaigning process in favor of Prime Minister Ilham Aliyev, son of current President Heydar Aliyev. The government has stacked the Central Election Commission and local election commission with its supporters, and banned local non-governmental organizations from monitoring the vote. As the elections draw nearer, government officials have openly sided with the campaign of Ilham Aliyev, constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition events. In some cases, local officials have closed all the roads into town during opposition rallies, or have extended working and school hours - on one occasion, even declaring a Sunday work day - to prevent participation in opposition rallies.\"\nThe Institute for Democracy in Eastern Europe provided 188 election observers. The mission, requested by the United States government, formed part of a larger group of observers monitoring under the auspices of the OSCE. The IDEE observers observed more than 1,000 voting precincts and Constituency Election Centers where votes were tabulated, and collectively issued a \"Votum Separatum,\" which expressed their outrage at election fraud, intimidation and political repression they witnessed during their observation mission and their disagreement with the OSCE's mild preliminary report calling the elections \"generally well administered.\"\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOSCE report",

He was raised as a Protestant. He studied German at university.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNiedergang started his career as a journalist for R\u00e9forme, a Protestant newspaper, in 1949. He joined Le Monde in 1952. He worked for France-Soir from 1956 to 1964. From 1964 to 1975, he worked for Le Monde once again, covering Iberian affairs and Latin America. From 1975 to 1996, he covered foreign affairs for Le Monde. For example, he covered the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat and the death of Salvador Allende.\nNiedergang was the author of several books. In 1960, he published Temp\u00eate sur le Congo, whose main topic was the decolonisation of the Belgian Congo. The book received the Albert Londres Prize in 1961. In 1962, he published Les 20 Am\u00e9riques latines, a bestseller which was reedited in 1969. In it, he argued that South America was made up of very different former Spanish and Portuguese colonies. He also suggested that Fidel Castro's leadership style was far more comparable to Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia or Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt than Nikita Khrushchev in the Soviet Union.\nIn the winter of 1999, Niedergang joined the Collectif Libert\u00e9 pour l'Afghanistan, an organization lobbying for the West to stop tolerating the Talibans and \"Osama bin Laden, the millionaire Saudi financier of terror\".\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nNiedergang was married. He spent much of his retirement in Peru.\n\n\n== Death ==\nNiedergang on December 28, 2001 in Neuilly-sur-Seine near Paris, France.\n\n\n== References ==",

Her grandfather was Jewish. In 1912 she moved to Berlin, and in 1923 married the Danish singer Paul Castonier, from whom she later divorced. She wrote satires in the weekly paper Die Ente, but during the Nazi period she went in exile to Vienna and after the Anschluss in 1938 through Italy and Denmark to London. Here she wrote children's books and also a book about Christian opposition to the Nazis. In London she was also a correspondent for the News Chronicle and the New Statesman and also for emigrant newspapers like the Pariser Tageszeitung and the Wiener Tageblatt. In 1944 she worked as a farmhand in Hampshire. From 1950, she also corresponded regularly with Mary Tucholsky, the widow of writer Kurt Tucholsky.\n\n\n== Works ==\nFrau, Knecht, Magd, 1932\nEternal Front, London: James Clarke and Co. 1942\nSt\u00fcrmisch bis heiter.

            "content": "Kristinn Hrafnsson (born 25 June 1962) is an Icelandic investigative journalist known for his former role as spokesperson for the WikiLeaks organisation between 2010 to 2017.\nHe has worked at various newspapers in Iceland and hosted the television programme Komp\u00e1s on the Icelandic channel St\u00f6\u00f0 2, where he and his team often exposed criminal activity and corruption in high places. In February 2009, while investigating the connection between Iceland's Kaupthing Bank and Robert Tchenguiz and Vincent Tchenguiz, the programme was taken off air and Kristinn and his crew were sacked.\nShortly thereafter, Kristinn was hired by R\u00daV, the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service. In August 2009, he was working on a story about Kaupthing's loan book which had just been published on the WikiLeaks webpage, when the bank got a gag order issued by the Reykjavik sheriff's office, banning R\u00daV from reporting on the loan book, which could be publicly accessed online via WikiLeaks. The prohibition order was withdrawn later.\nKristinn was dismissed from R\u00daV (his contract was not renewed) in July 2010. After this point, he worked as an independent journalist. Beginning in 2010, he collaborated with WikiLeaks, serving as the organisation's spokesman after founder Julian Assange withdrew from the limelight. He has called the December 2010 attacks on WikiLeaks by MasterCard, Visa, and others a \"privatisation of censorship\". In 2012, in his capacity as WikiLeaks spokesman, he defended the organisation on the website of Swedish Television against what he described as a smear campaign by the Swedish tabloid Expressen.\nKristinn has been named Icelandic journalist of the year three times, in 2004, 2007 and 2010 by Iceland\u2019s National Union of Journalists.\nIn early 2017, Hrafnsson stated that he was no longer spokesperson for Wikileaks.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Lake Pedder, once a natural lake, is a man-made impoundment and diversion lake located in the southwest of Tasmania, Australia. In addition to its natural catchment from the Frankland Range, the lake is formed by the 1972 damming of the Serpentine and Huon rivers by the Hydro Electric Commission of Tasmania for the purposes of hydroelectric power generation.\nAs a result, the flooded Lake Pedder now has a surface area of approximately 242 square kilometres (93 sq mi) and it is the largest freshwater lake in Australia.\n\n\n== The original and modified lake ==\n\nIn early 20th century the original lake was named after Sir John Pedder, the first Chief Justice of Tasmania. The name of the original lake was officially transferred to the new man-made impoundment. Although the new Lake Pedder incorporates the original lake, it does not resemble it in size, appearance or ecology.\nThe new lake consists of an impoundment contained by three dams:\nSerpentine Dam \u2013 a 38-metre (125 ft) high rockfill dam with a concrete upstream face on the Serpentine River.\nScotts Peak Dam \u2013 a 43-metre (141 ft) high rockfill dam with a bitumen upstream face on the upper reaches of the Huon River near Scotts Peak.\nEdgar Dam \u2013 a 17-metre (56 ft) high rockfill dam at Lake Edgar near Scotts Peak.\nThe dams were designed and constructed by Tasmania's Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) as part of the Upper Gordon River hydro-electric generation scheme. The aim of this scheme was to increase Tasmania's capacity to generate hydro-electricity in accordance with the Tasmanian Government's policy of attempting to attract secondary industry to the State with the incentive of cheap renewable energy.\nThe new Huon Serpentine impoundment, which filled after the dams were completed in 1972, drains into Lake Gordon via the McPartlan Pass Canal at 42\u00b051\u20324\u2033S 146\u00b011\u20322\u2033E. Together, the lakes form the biggest water catchment and storage system in Australia.\n\n\n== Damming ==\n\nThere were protests in Tasmania and mainland Australia at the flooding of the original lake, before, during and after construction of the dams. Protests began when in 1967 the Tasmanian Government revoked the status of the Lake Pedder National Park that had protected the lake since 1955. The role of the HEC as a surrogate wing of the Tasmanian government was perceived when the political or wider social dissent against the HEC power over the Tasmanian environment seemed impregnable. Tasmania's political leader, Premier Eric Reece and Allan Knight, the HEC Commissioner, were seen as the leading proponents of the 'damming' of Tasmania against any opinion to the contrary, and were not averse to taking their opinions to statewide and national advertising campaigns asserting their right to dam the lake.\n\nReece was well known for his staunch support of the HEC and its power development schemes on the Gordon River, which earned him the nickname \"Electric Eric\". In 1972, he approved the flooding of Lake Pedder, which proceeded despite a determined protest movement and a blank cheque offer from Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to preserve the Lake Pedder area. Reece refused Whitlam's offer, stating that he would \"not have the Federal Government interfering with the sovereign rights of Tasmania\".\nReece was quoted as saying:\n\n\"There was a National Park out there, but I can't remember exactly where it was . . . at least, it wasn't of substantial significance in the scheme of things. The thing that was significant was that we had to double the output of power in this state in ten years in order [to] supply the demands of industry and the community. And this was the scheme that looked as though it could do a greater part of [the] job for us.\"\n\n\n== Flooding ==\nA series of photographs in the 1976 Tasmanian Year book illustrated the process of flooding of the Lake Pedder area.\n\n\n== Community response ==\nOpposition to the flooding of Lake Pedder extended well beyond Tasmania and spread throughout Australia and internationally. The focus on the South West Tasmania Wilderness area as an environmental battleground increased interest in the area, and many travelled to Lake Pedder before it was flooded to see what the issues were about.\nThe protests included the United Tasmania Group who were the precursor to the Tasmanian Greens and are now recognised as the world's first green party. The group that preceded the Tasmanian Wilderness Society \u2013 the South West Tasmania Action Committee continued after the flooding, with the knowledge that surveying and appraising other catchments in the south west and west of Tasmania was well underway by the HEC. Although increasingly sophisticated economic, environmental and engineering arguments were raised by the opponents of the dam, it was not until the Franklin scheme that either the Hydro or its defenders were even considering the critiques. In 1972, the Christian activist Brenda Hean perished with pilot Max Price in a tiger moth aircraft they were flying from Tasmania to Canberra to protest the damming of Lake Pedder; it was alleged that pro-dam campaigners had entered the plane's hangar and placed sugar in one of its fuel tanks.\nHesba Fay Brinsmead, an Australian children's author and environmentalist, wrote two books about the damming of Lake Pedder:\nEcho in the Wilderness is a children's novel set on Lake Pedder on the eve of its flooding (published 1972)\nI Will Not Say the Day Is Done (her only non-fiction/adult book) describes the struggle to save Lake Pedder (published 1983)\nConcerns over the construction of the dam revolved around the loss of the distinctive pink quartzite beach of the original lake, and an increased understanding of the unique nature of the wilderness quality to the south west of Tasmania. This developed further with the Franklin Dam issue.\nIn 1994, a campaign group was launched called Pedder 2000. They proposed, unsuccessfully, the draining and restoration of the lake to its original state. There is an ongoing low-key campaign with the same goal by the group known as the Lake Pedder Action Committee which remains active\n\n\n== A controversial and contested name ==\nAs is the case in many land use, land ownership and territorial disputes, the name currently officially assigned to this body of water has considerable significance. It is also important in terms of understanding the technical status of the body of water as a component of a hydro-electric scheme.\nFrom a technical, hydro-electric scheme point of view, the current Lake Pedder can be correctly termed a lake or reservoir as the water from Lake Pedder can flow into Lake Gordon via the McPartlan's Pass canal and is thereby connected to the Gordon power station. However, people opposed to the flooding of the original lake do not accept the legitimacy of the official, gazetted name of Lake Pedder for the body of water that drowned it in 1972. Instead, they prefer to use the name Huon-Serpentine Impoundment. This name denotes the two major rivers dammed to create the current lake (Huon and Serpentine) and describes the technical status of the lake as an element of a hydro-electric scheme (impoundment) more accurately than the terms lake or reservoir. Bushwalkers sometimes informally refer to it as \"Fake Pedder\".\n\n\n== Lake Pedder extinctions ==\nThe Lake Pedder earthworm (Hypolimnus pedderensis) is only known by the type specimen collected from a beach on Lake Pedder, Tasmania in 1971. After the flooding of the lake, this invertebrate was never seen again. A 1996 survey that sought to determine whether the species still existed in the area failed to find any examples. Since 2003 the Lake Pedder Earthworm has been listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nAn extinction claimed to have occurred after the flooding is that of the Lake Pedder planarian (Romankenkius pedderensis), an endemic flatworm. Since 1996 this invertebrate has also been listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In 2012 the continued existence of this species was reported.\nThe Pedder galaxias, an Australian freshwater fish, is considered extinct in its natural habitat of Lake Pedder and its tributaries, although it still exists in captivity and in two translocated populations, one at Lake Oberon in the Western Arthurs mountain range. and one at a modified water supply dam near Strathgordon.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of reservoirs and dams in Tasmania\nFrankland Range\nGordon Power Station\nOlegas Truchanas\nOlegas (opera)\nTasmanian Wilderness Society\nThe South West Book\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBuckman, Greg (2008), Tasmania's Wilderness Battles A History, Allen & Unwin, ISBN 978-1-74176-487-1 \nGee, Helen, (joint ed.); Fenton, Janet, (joint ed.); Australian Conservation Foundation (1978), The south west book : a Tasmanian wilderness, Australian Conservation Foundation, ISBN 978-0-85802-056-6 CS1 maint: Multiple names: authors list (link)\nGreen, Roger; Lea, G; Australian Conservation Foundation (1984), Battle for the Franklin : conversations with the combatants in the struggle for south west Tasmania, Fontana/Australian Conservation Foundation, ISBN 978-0-00-636715-4 \nLines, William J (2006), Patriots : defending Australia's natural heritage, University of Queensland Press, ISBN 978-0-7022-3554-2 \nNeilson, David (1975), South West Tasmania : a land of the wild, Rigby, ISBN 978-0-85179-874-5 \nThompson, Peter; Australian Conservation Foundation (1981), Power in Tasmania, Australian Conservation Foundation, ISBN 978-0-85802-067-2 \n\n\n== External links ==\nGordon River Power Scheme \u2013 Hydro Tasmania\nPosition in World Heritage Area \u2013 Tasmanian National Parks\nPanorama of new Lake Pedder \u2013 Photograph\nNational Archives original documents relating to Lake Pedder",

            "content": "David Michael \"Dave\" Keon (born March 22, 1940) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey centre. He played professionally from 1960 to 1982, including 15 seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1986. Keon was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2010. On October 16, 2016, as part of the Toronto Maple Leafs centennial celebrations, Keon was named the greatest player in the team's history. In 2017 Keon was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in NHL history.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Junior hockey ===\nKeon played junior hockey in Toronto for the St. Michael's Buzzers of the Ontario Hockey Association's Metro Junior B league in 1956\u201357; on December 20, 1956, he scored seven goals in one game. In February 1957, he was named to the league's eastern all-star team and was picked by NHL scouts as the top prospect in the league. Keon was selected as the league's rookie of the year, finishing second in scoring, and his team won the league championship. He played some games that season for the Junior A St. Michael's Majors, and moved to that club full-time for the 1957\u201358 season. Keon played for St. Michael's through the end of the 1960 season, when he turned professional and joined the Sudbury Wolves of the Eastern Professional Hockey League for four playoff games. They would be the only games he would ever play in the minor leagues.\n\n\n=== Toronto Maple Leafs ===\nKeon joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League for the 1960\u201361 season, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's top rookie with 20 goals and 45 points in his first season. It was his first of six consecutive 20-goal seasons. In his second year in the NHL, Keon was named to the Second All-Star Team and won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as most gentlemanly player, taking only one minor penalty through the entire season. He repeated as Lady Byng winner in 1962\u201363, again taking only a single minor penalty all year.\nHe was the Leafs' leading scorer in the 1963\u201364, 1966\u201367 and 1969\u201370 seasons, and the team's top goal scorer in 1970\u201371 and 1972\u201373. Keon was considered one of the fastest skaters in the NHL, and one of the best defensive forwards of his era. He would usually play against the opposing team's top centre, and developed a reputation for neutralizing some of the league's top scorers. In 1970\u201371, he scored eight shorthanded goals, setting an NHL record for most shorthanded goals scored in a single season, which would later be broken by Marcel Dionne in 1974\u201375, with 10 shorthanded goals (Dionne's record would be broken by Wayne Gretzky in 1983\u201384 with 12 shorthanded goals. In turn, Gretzky's record would be broken by Mario Lemieux in 1988\u201389, when Lemieux scored 13 shorthanded goals in a season).\nKeon won four Stanley Cups with the Leafs, playing on the Cup-winning teams of 1961\u201362, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364 and 1966\u201367. In the 1967 Cup Final, he shut down Jean B\u00e9liveau, the star centreman of the Montreal Canadiens, in the last two games of the series and was voted the most valuable player of the playoffs, winning the Conn Smythe Trophy. Keon's eight points is the fewest ever by a non-goalie Conn Smythe winner, and he remains the only Leaf to have won the trophy named for the former owner of the club.\nHe was named team captain on October 31, 1969, succeeding George Armstrong who was said to be retiring from hockey. Armstrong returned to the Leafs two weeks later and played for another two seasons, but Keon remained captain and would wear the C through the rest of his years with the Leafs.\nKeon hoped to make Team Canada for the 1972 Summit Series, but was coming off one of the worst years of his career, finishing the 1971\u201372 season with his lowest points-per-game average since his rookie year. The final pick for Team Canada came down between Keon and Bobby Clarke. It is believed that Clarke was selected because he had more points.\nWhile Keon was not selected for Team Canada, the Ottawa Nationals of the World Hockey Association made a strong effort to sign Keon, whom they had placed on their negotiation list earlier that year. Harold Ballard, who had become the Leafs' majority owner in March 1972, said that Keon did not provide the leadership the team needed during the previous season and was refusing to give Keon a big salary increase after a poor year. Keon signed a letter of intent with the Nationals, and received a $50,000 cheque from the team, but the deal fell apart just before training camp. Keon signed a three-year deal with the Leafs, and rebounded strongly in 1972\u201373, scoring 37 goals. On November 22, 1972, he scored his 297th goal as a Leaf, passing Armstrong and Frank Mahovlich to become the team's all-time leading goal scorer.\nEarly into the 1974\u201375 season, Ballard publicly blasted Keon, saying that the team was not getting good leadership from its captain and vowing never again to agree to a no-trade clause in a contract, as he had with Keon. When Keon's contract expired at the end of the season, Ballard made it clear that there was no place for him on the Leafs. The Leafs believed they had some strong young prospects at centre who needed more ice time, and Keon was again asking for a contract with a no-trade clause. The 35-year-old Keon was told he could make his own deal with another NHL team, but any club signing him would have been required to provide compensation to the Leafs. Ballard set the compensation price so high that other teams shied away from signing him, even though the Leafs had no intention of keeping him. In effect, Ballard had blocked Keon from going to another NHL team.\n\n\n=== WHA ===\nIn August 1975, with the Leafs still controlling his NHL rights, Keon jumped to the World Hockey Association, signing a deal with the Minnesota Fighting Saints reportedly worth $300,000 over two seasons. The head coach of the Saints was Harry Neale, an old friend of Keon's. The team, and Keon, played well, but struggled badly financially. With 21 games left in the season, the team folded. Keon was expected to return to the NHL and was not included in the dispersal sale of Saints players to other WHA teams. The NHL's New York Islanders wanted Keon, but needed to negotiate a deal for his NHL rights with the Leafs. Again, the Leafs' asking price (said to have been a first-round draft pick) was too high, and a disappointed Keon signed with the WHA's Indianapolis Racers in March 1976.\nThe Fighting Saints were revived for the start of the WHA's 1976\u201377 season, and Keon was traded back to Minnesota, but the team folded for good half-way through the season (with Keon as its leading scorer). Keon was briefly the property of the Edmonton Oilers who immediately traded him to the New England Whalers in January 1977.\n\n\n=== Return to NHL ===\nHe would remain with the Whalers through the rest of his career. In the 1977\u201378 season, Keon was joined on the Whalers by Gordie Howe who, at age 50, was the team's leading scorer that season. Keon returned to the NHL in 1979 when the renamed Hartford Whalers became one of four WHA teams to join the NHL. The merger agreement allowed existing NHL teams to reclaim most of the WHA players whose NHL rights they held. Nevertheless, even though Keon was not protected from reclamation by the Whalers in the reclamation draft, the Maple Leafs declined to reclaim their former captain, allowing him to remain in Hartford. Bobby Hull joined the Whalers that season, with Keon, Howe, and Hull sometimes playing as a forward line. Howe and Hull retired at the end of the season, leaving Keon as the oldest player in the NHL. Keon played two more seasons with the Whalers and announced his retirement on June 30, 1982, at age 42.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\nFollowing his retirement from hockey, Keon moved to Florida and worked in real estate for several years.\nBitter over his treatment by Ballard and the Leafs, Keon refused for many years to have any relationship with the Leafs organization, even after Ballard's death and after the club changed ownership several times.[1] Other Leaf players who clashed with Ballard's management did reconcile, most notably Keon's successor as club captain, Darryl Sittler, who accepted an invitation from GM Cliff Fletcher to return as a consultant after the team came under the ownership of Steve Stavro.\nKeon turned down several offers of reconciliation from the team, including an invitation to the closing ceremony for Maple Leaf Gardens in 1999 and a proposed ceremony to honour his number.\nOn March 22, 1991, with the Leafs under new management after Ballard's death, Keon played on a team of Leaf all-stars against their counterparts from the Montreal Canadiens in an old-timers game at Maple Leaf Gardens called Legends' Night in Canada. \"After that, I figured out the new ownership was no different than Ballard, and I had no use for it,\" Keon later said. In 2005, he told the Toronto Sun that the new owners (majority equity owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, chaired by Larry Tanenbaum) \"would like to say they are different, but they are all the same.\"\nIn January 2007, the Toronto Maple Leafs announced that Keon would attend a pre-game ceremony to honour its 1967 Stanley Cup winning team. Keon was one of several members of the 1967 team to appear on-ice at the Air Canada Centre before the Leafs' game on February 17, 2007 \u2014 the 80th anniversary of first game played by the Toronto franchise after being renamed the Maple Leafs in 1927. Keon was introduced to the crowd second last, just prior to 1967 captain George Armstrong, and received a long standing ovation. On February 16, 2013, Keon was a part of a pre-game ceremony honouring the 1963 Stanley Cup-winning Leafs team. He similarly appeared on February 8, 2014, with other members of the 1964 Cup winners.\nHis granddaughter, Kaitlyn Keon played the Brown Bears women's ice hockey program from 2011 to 2015, accumulating 34 points.\nOn January 21, 2016, it was announced that Keon, along with former Maple Leafs Turk Broda and Tim Horton, would be commemorated with a statue on Legends Row in front of the Air Canada Centre, joining former Maple Leafs greats Syl Apps, Teeder Kennedy, Johnny Bower, George Armstrong, Darryl Sittler, Borje Salming, and Mats Sundin.\nOn October 14, 2016, the Toronto Maple Leafs released their list of the top 100 Leafs of all time.

Shear stress arises from the force vector component parallel to the cross section. Normal stress, on the other hand, arises from the force vector component perpendicular to the material cross section on which it acts.\nShear stress arises from shear forces, which are pairs of equal and opposing forces acting on opposite sides of an object.\n\n\n== General shear stress ==\nThe formula to calculate average shear stress is force per unit area.:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        \n          \n            F\n            A\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau ={F \\over A},}\n  \nwhere:\n\u03c4 = the shear stress;\nF = the force applied;\nA = the cross-sectional area of material with area parallel to the applied force vector.\n\n\n== Other forms ==\n\n\n=== Pure ===\nPure shear stress is related to pure shear strain, denoted \u03b3, by the following equation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        \u03b3\n        G\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =\\gamma G\\,}\n  \nwhere G is the shear modulus of the isotropic material, given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        G\n        =\n        \n          \n            E\n            \n              2\n              (\n              1\n              +\n              \u03bd\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G={\\frac {E}{2(1+\\nu )}}.}\n  \nHere E is Young's modulus and \u03bd is Poisson's ratio.\n\n\n=== Beam shear ===\nBeam shear is defined as the internal shear stress of a beam caused by the shear force applied to the beam.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              f\n              Q\n            \n            \n              I\n              b\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau ={fQ \\over Ib},}\n  \nwhere\nf = total shear force at the location in question;\nQ = statical moment of area;\nb = thickness (width) in the material perpendicular to the shear;\nI = Moment of Inertia of the entire cross sectional area.\nThe beam shear formula is also known as Zhuravskii shear stress formula after Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii who derived it in 1855.\n\n\n=== Semi-monocoque shear ===\n\nShear stresses within a semi-monocoque structure may be calculated by idealizing the cross-section of the structure into a set of stringers (carrying only axial loads) and webs (carrying only shear flows). Dividing the shear flow by the thickness of a given portion of the semi-monocoque structure yields the shear stress. Thus, the maximum shear stress will occur either in the web of maximum shear flow or minimum thickness\nAlso constructions in soil can fail due to shear; e.g., the weight of an earth-filled dam or dike may cause the subsoil to collapse, like a small landslide.\n\n\n=== Impact shear ===\nThe maximum shear stress created in a solid round bar subject to impact is given as the equation:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                2\n                U\n                G\n              \n              V\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau ={\\sqrt {2UG \\over V}},}\n  \nwhere\nU = change in kinetic energy;\nG = shear modulus;\nV = volume of rod;\nand\nU = Urotating + Uapplied;\nUrotating = 1/2I\u03c92;\nUapplied = T\u03b8displaced;\nI = mass moment of inertia;\n\u03c9 = angular speed.\n\n\n=== Shear stress in fluids ===\n\nAny real fluids (liquids and gases included) moving along solid boundary will incur a shear stress on that boundary. The no-slip condition dictates that the speed of the fluid at the boundary (relative to the boundary) is zero, but at some height from the boundary the flow speed must equal that of the fluid. The region between these two points is aptly named the boundary layer. For all Newtonian fluids in laminar flow the shear stress is proportional to the strain rate in the fluid where the viscosity is the constant of proportionality. However, for non-Newtonian fluids, this is no longer the case as for these fluids the viscosity is not constant. The shear stress is imparted onto the boundary as a result of this loss of velocity. The shear stress, for a Newtonian fluid, at a surface element parallel to a flat plate, at the point y, is given by:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        (\n        y\n        )\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              u\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              y\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau (y)=\\mu {\\frac {\\partial u}{\\partial y}}}\n  \nwhere\n\u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of the flow;\nu is the flow velocity along the boundary;\ny is the height above the boundary.\nSpecifically, the wall shear stress is defined as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n          \n            \n              w\n            \n          \n        \n        \u2261\n        \u03c4\n        (\n        y\n        =\n        0\n        )\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        \n          \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \u2202\n                  u\n                \n                \n                  \u2202\n                  y\n                \n              \n            \n            |\n          \n          \n            y\n            =\n            0\n          \n        \n         \n         \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau _{\\mathrm {w} }\\equiv \\tau (y=0)=\\mu \\left.{\\frac {\\partial u}{\\partial y}}\\right|_{y=0}~~.}\n  \nThe Newton's constitutive law, for any general geometry (including the flat plate above mentioned), states that shear tensor (a second-order tensor) is proportional to the flow velocity gradient (the velocity is a vector, so its gradient is a second-order tensor):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n        \n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              u\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        \u2207\n        \n          \n            \n              u\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {\\tau } ({\\vec {u}})=\\mu \\nabla {\\vec {u}}}\n  \nand the constant of proportionality is named dynamic viscosity. For an isotropic Newtonian flow it is a scalar, while for anisotropic Newtonian flows it can be a second-order tensor too. The fundamental aspect is that for a Newtonian fluid the dynamic viscosity is independent on flow velocity (i.e., the shear stress constituive law is linear), while non-Newtonian flows this is not true, and one should allow for the modification:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n        \n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              u\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \u03bc\n        (\n        \n          \n            \n              u\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n        \n        )\n        \u2207\n        \n          \n            \n              u\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {\\tau } ({\\vec {u}})=\\mu ({\\vec {u}})\\nabla {\\vec {u}}}\n  \nThe above formula is no longer the Newton's law but a generic tensorial identity: one could always find an expression of the viscosity as function of the flow velocity given any expression of the shear stress as function of the flow velocity. On the other hand, given a shear stress as function of the flow velocity, it represents a Newtonian flow only if it can be expressed as a constant for the gradient of the flow velocity. The constant one finds in this case is the dynamic viscosity of the flow.\n\n\n==== Example ====\nConsidering a 2D space in cartesian coordinates (x,y) (the flow velocity components are respectively

If a sensor could directly measure the gradient of the velocity profile at the wall, then multiplying by the dynamic viscosity would yield the shear stress. Such a sensor was demonstrated by A. A. Naqwi and W. C. Reynolds. The interference pattern generated by sending a beam of light through two parallel slits forms a network of linearly diverging fringes that seem to originate from the plane of the two slits (see double-slit experiment). As a particle in a fluid passes through the fringes, a receiver detects the reflection of the fringe pattern. The signal can be processed, and knowing the fringe angle, the height and velocity of the particle can be extrapolated. The measured value of wall velocity gradient is independent of the fluid properties and as a result does not require calibration. Recent advancements in the micro-optic fabrication technologies have made it possible to use integrated diffractive optical element to fabricate diverging fringe shear stress sensors usable both in air and liquid.\n\n\n=== Micro-pillar shear-stress sensor ===\nA further technique is that of slender wall-mounted micro-pillars made of the flexible polymer PDMS, which bend in reaction to the applying drag forces in the vicinity of the wall. The sensor thereby belongs to the indirect measurement principles relying on the relationship between near-wall velocity gradients and the local wall-shear stress.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCritical resolved shear stress\nDirect shear test\nShear and moment diagrams\nShear rate\nShear strain\nShear strength\nTensile stress\nTriaxial shear test\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The winter of 2010\u20132011 was a weather event that brought heavy snowfalls, record low temperatures, travel chaos and school disruption to the islands of Britain and Ireland. It included the UK's coldest December since Met Office records began in 1910, with a mean temperature of -1 \u00b0C, breaking the previous record of 0.1 \u00b0C in December 1981. Also it was the second-coldest December in the narrower Central England Temperature (CET) record series which began in 1659, falling 0.1 \u00b0C short of the all-time record set in 1890.\nThe winter of 2010 in England saw the earliest widespread winter snowfall since 1993 with snow falling as early as 24 November across Northumberland and North Yorkshire. A maximum snow depth of 30 inches (76 cm) was recorded on 1 December in the Peak District, Sheffield, the Cotswold Hills and the Forest of Dean. In this event Scotland and Northern England were most severely affected. On 9 December temperatures recovered across much of the UK, causing a partial thaw.\nLater, on Thursday 16 December a cold front reintroduced a cold, arctic airstream. This cold spell brought further snow and ice chaos back to the British Isles with Southern England, Wales, the Republic of Ireland (excluding the westerly coastal regions) and Northern Ireland bearing the brunt of the wintry conditions. This led to severe disruption to the road and rail network with several airports being closed including London Heathrow Airport for a time. Several local temperature records were broken including a new record low for Northern Ireland of -18.7 \u00b0C recorded at Castlederg on 23 December 2010.\nBy the new year a thaw had begun, and there was no recurrence of the extreme conditions for the remainder of the winter. There was some snowfall in early January, and there was an anticyclonic spell at the end of the month that brought some cold, frosty days. February was above average in temperature and ended on a mild note, although the snow returned in much of Scotland during March.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the latter part of November, northern blocking established over Greenland which resulted in the Jet Stream moving south, allowing cold air to flow in from the east. Forecasters warned of the potential for severe winter weather from weeks in advance and the Government stated that they were prepared for winter weather after the previous British winter of 2009\u20132010 caused havoc and widespread disruption. The cold weather arrived in Britain and Ireland on 22 November and by 24 November, snow showers brought by a stiff northerly wind fell over the North East of England and Northern and Eastern Scotland which resulted in 10\u201320 cm locally and gridlock in many of the major roads within Aberdeen during the evening rush hour of 24 November.\nIn the following days, the snowfall became far more widespread leading to widespread travel disruption, school closures and cancellation of sporting fixtures. The Met Office confirmed that it was the most widespread snowfall in the United Kingdom for 17 years. By 2 December, most of the United Kingdom and much of Ireland was covered with snow, accumulations in the north and east of Scotland and England were over 50 cm in places, with over one metre of snow lying on much of the Scottish mountains. Snow depths elsewhere were between 5 cm\u201330 cm widely. Temperatures fell widely below \u221210 \u00b0C with some areas staying sub-zero by day. On 2 December there was particularly low temperatures in major towns and cities, particularly in Scotland where it dropped to \u221218 \u00b0C in Aberdeen and on 3 December temperatures in England broke records. However, the lowest temperature of the winter of \u221221.2 \u00b0C was recorded at Altnaharra, Sutherland at 10 am on 2 December and Braemar and Kinbrace both dropped to \u221220 \u00b0C on the night of 2 December. As of 4 December 7 people have been confirmed to have died due to the cold weather.\n\n\n== Reported effects ==\n\n\n=== Deaths ===\n\nOn 30 November in Newport, South Wales a man was found dead in the street\u2014it was assumed that he froze to death after collapsing with a heart attack.\nTwo old-age pensioners were found in the snow in their gardens dead from hypothermia at the beginning of December.\nOn 2 December two teenage girls died in a car crash caused by ice on the A595 in Cumbria.\nOn 6 December a 70-year-old man was found dead in the snow in a caravan park in Cleethorpes, and a man died trying to clear snow outside his home in Darlington, County Durham.\nThere were several deaths on 18 December: a 17-year-old boy from Bilsington, Kent, was killed when his car left the road; two pedestrians died after being hit by a Range Rover in Glasgow; a woman in her 60s from the Inverness area, was killed in a three-vehicle pile-up in Huntly, Aberdeenshire; and a man in his early 30s suffered life-threatening injuries when his Mini was in a crash with a highways vehicle near Eastbourne, East Sussex, and died after an ambulance being driven by a police officer left a country road in poor weather conditions and careered into a bush on Standard Hill, in Ninfield.\nOn 19 December there were several more deaths. A 33-year-old man died after falling through the ice on Doggetts Lake in Rochford, Essex; a road crash killed 16-year-old James Doran and Jordan Kenny when the car they were travelling in lost control on an icy road in Liverpool and ploughed into a garden wall; a 15-year-old girl died in a sledding accident in Douglas, County Cork, Ireland; and a 35-year-old woman and her 9-year-old son were killed in a car crash caused by ice and snow near Castlebellingham in County Louth, Ireland.\nOn 22 December, a 48-year-old man died from hypothermia, after sleeping overnight in the Bible Gardens, behind the cathedral in Bangor, North Wales.\n\n\n=== Economy ===\nThe severe cold spell came in the run up to Christmas and was estimated to cost the British economy up to \u00a31.2 billion a day with a total cost of \u00a313 billion. Retailers were particularly badly hit by lost sales with footfall down nearly 20% compared to the same period the previous year and as much as 30% in the West Midlands and South East. Some experts suggested that it may have a knock on effect in delaying or reversing economic growth. Christmas is usually the most profitable period for the pub and restaurant industry, however, due to disruptions to delivery routes, numerous stock outs and disappointing trading updates were reported.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nSignificant reduction in availability of transport\n\n\n==== Road ====\nOn 1 December the M1 motorway was temporarily closed, and the Forth Road Bridge was closed for over ten hours due to heavy snowfall. This was the first time the bridge had been closed because of snow. The same day, the A57 was closed in the evening between Anston and Worksop and over 100 motorists were stranded overnight. Thousands of motorists across Sheffield became stranded on 1\u20137 December as up to as much as 2 feet of snow fell on the city with severe disruption across the county of South Yorkshire including the suspension of all bus services for 24 hours. On 6 December, vehicles were trapped on the M8 for over 10 hours, and more than 1,000 vehicles became stuck on the M876.\n\n\n==== Rail ====\nEurostar rail services to the continent were cancelled on 20 December causing severe delays with queues at St Pancras station stretching more than half a mile as far back as the British Library. At the same time. services were cancelled on the East Coast main line between London and Peterborough due to damage to overhead power cables caused by accretion of ice.\n\n\n==== Air ====\nAt Newcastle Airport, a plane overshot its target stop position on the runway, but remaining on the hard surface. This caused the airport to be temporarily closed. No passengers were injured.\nGatwick Airport and Edinburgh Airport were closed all day on 1 December due to heavy snow.\n\n\n=== Other effects ===\n7,000 schools were closed on 2 December.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== November 2010 ===\n\n\n==== 22\u201324 November ====\nAs the cold weather arrived in the United Kingdom and Ireland, forecasters warned of cold and snowy conditions arriving later in the week and persisting into much of the next. Each day, the temperature dropped and wintry showers began to arrive in some parts of the Highlands.\nA snow storm had moved on from southern Sweden on the 22nd to dust both Northumberland and the Scottish Borders Region during the 23rd before being absorbed on the 24th into the main weather system that started advancing from Scandinavia on the 23rd. Light snow fell in Aberdeenshire, Northumberland, parts of Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire and Birmingham on those days as the first storms began to clear up on the 23rd.\nSnow began to fall in the early evening on 24 November. Within an hour of the snow beginning to fall around 2 inches was recorded in Newcastle upon Tyne. Snow fell across northern and eastern parts of Scotland and England which caused disruption during the evening, particularly in Aberdeen. The Met Office issued many weather warnings and confirmed that the snowfall was the earliest widespread snowfall since 1993. A minimum temperature of -5.6 \u00b0C was recorded in Benson, Oxfordshire. The Met Office issued warnings for Northern Scotland, the Borders, North East England and Yorkshire and the Humber.\n\n\n==== 25 November ====\nDuring the day, snow showers affected the North and North-East of Scotland and England. A minimum temperature of -7.0 \u00b0C was recorded in Woodford. Snow caused problems to the Grampian district and Borders forcing over 120 schools in Aberdeenshire to close. The Met Office issued further warning of snow to much of the eastern districts of Scotland. Roads closed due to the snow were the B974, the A939 at the Lecht, the A93 at the Cairnwell and the B976 Crathie to Gairnside.\n\n\n==== 26 November ====\nOn the 26th night time temperatures plummeted well below 0 \u00b0C, with the Welsh towns of Sennybridge and Trawscoed being among the coldest places at \u201310.2 \u00b0C. The village of Dalwhinnie in the Scottish Highlands saw the temperatures fall to \u20138.2 \u00b0C and Chesham in Buckinghamshire fell to -7 \u00b0C, and Preston in Lancashire recorded -5.8 \u00b0C. The cold snap heralded the earliest winter snow fall for 17 years.\nA minimum temperature of -9.1 \u00b0C was recorded at Redesdale Camp, Northumberland. Ireland was hit by snowfall. Overnight, a front brought by a north easterly wind brought 5\u201310 cm of fresh snow to many parts of Scotland, with 10\u201315 cm in North East England. The AA dealt with an estimated 15,500 calls regarding breakdowns on the 26th.\nThe night of the 26th/27th saw a thunder storm damage electrical systems and flood roads, causing disruption transport services on the 27th with trains in Dublin worst hit.\n\n\n==== 27 November ====\nThe morning of Saturday 27 November saw Ireland freezing in what could be a rather costly cold snap as it emerged that the extreme weather earlier this year cost a colossal \u20ac297 million in insurance payouts due to the snow causing damage was also caused to homes and other buildings all over the country. The Irish Insurance Federation revealed there were 22,450 claims from the public, the vast majority of which involved snow or ice damage to people's homes. The DART and the northern commuter and Maynooth commuter lines were not running and Belfast and Rosslare train services out of Dublin were also affected. The main runway at Dublin Airport due to snow and ice for most of the day. The extreme weather was reminiscent of the winter storms of 2009\u20132010, which were the worst in recent Irish history.\nThe Met Office severe weather warnings remained in place across much of the UK, with Scotland and North East England predicted to have the heaviest snowfalls, with new warnings are also in place for icy roads in Northern Ireland and Wales as forecasters reckon it could remain cold and snowy for up to 2 weeks. Some FA Cup second round football matches, could be affected with Saturday horse racing at Newcastle upon Tyne the first to be called off. Snow was causing problems on the M6 through Staffordshire so gritters were out in force as temperatures dipped to -3 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F).\nBy the middle of the 27th up to 1.5 inches of snow fell in parts of Staffordshire overnight while residents in the Black Country also woke up to a covering today with warnings of way with blizzards expected in the region with a predicted snow fall of 8 inches over the next few days. Snow was causing problems on the M6 through Staffordshire so gritters were out in force as temperatures dipped to -3 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F). The Met Office warned that most of the snowfall during last night was in Staffordshire, but with showers in the West Midlands and Shropshire at around dawn.\nBy the afternoon the AA had faced a 40% rise on a normal Saturday in November, a spokesman said. The worst affected areas were around Newcastle upon Tyne, Mid Wales, North Wales, Norwich, Leeds and Bradford. Motorists in Wales and Northern Ireland struggled with icy roads while Scotland was facing more heavy snow and drifts thanks to a biting wind.\nThe Met Office warned of icy roads in Greater London and the South East, the South West, the East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber and North East England. North East England, Yorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands and the South West were also braced for heavy snow. About 10 inches of snow was expected over the higher parts of the country, with a light dusting in Greater London and lower lying parts of the English Midlands. They reckoned that the cold snap would continue, with snow blanketing swathes of the country by the middle of this week. A minimum of -10.2 \u00b0C at Trawsgoed, Wales was recorded. Further snow showers gave additional accumulations in the North and East.\nOcado online supermarket had seen a surge in demand for de-icer with sales while the cold weather had also brought a 42% increase in sales of cough medicine. Tesco had also seen a rise in the sales of de-icer and table salt.\n\n\n==== 28 November ====\nThe CET (Central England Temperature) mean of -4.0 \u00b0C was of note on this day, due to it being the lowest November CET mean since -4.6 \u00b0C was recorded on 24 November 1904. The lowest temperature of the month was also recorded today, of -17.5 \u00b0C at Llysdinam, Wales. Heavy wet snow affected Southern and Eastern Scotland widely giving 10\u201320 cm, but 20\u201330 cm in places. Thundersnow was reported around Dundee.\n\n\n==== 29 November ====\nMinimum of -16.1 \u00b0C at Altnaharra, Scottish Highlands. The Met Office at RAF Linton-on-Ouse in North Yorkshire recorded a record low for November of -11.2 \u00b0C; earlier that month on the 4th it had recorded a record maximum for November of 17.6 \u00b0C. The heavy wet snow which had been affecting Scotland the day before gave thundersnow to North East England, and further accumulations of 10\u201315 cm. Accumulations widely exceeded a foot across Southern and Eastern Scotland and North East England by this point.\n\n\n==== 30 November ====\nMinimum of -15.0 \u00b0C at Altnaharra, Scottish Highlands. After a dry night snow showers returned to the North and East. North West England, most notably Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire had their first snowfall of the winter overnight which caused many disruptions.\n\n\n=== December 2010 ===\nAccording to the Manley Central England Temperature record (beginning in 1659), the second-coldest December ever recorded in central England. Also the coldest December in the UK since UK records began in 1890, and the coldest December in Ireland since official records began.\n\n\n==== 1 December ====\n\nA minimum of -21.1 \u00b0C was recorded at Altnaharra, Scottish Highlands. A band of snow moving north affected Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, South and West Yorkshire, giving significant accumulations here, with further frequent heavy snow showers to North East England and Eastern Scotland. Up to 40 cm of snow was recorded in Rotherham and Sheffield, 20 cm of fresh snow in Mansfield (bringing total depths to over 30 cm), 20 to 30 cm in Leeds, 30 cm in Pontefract and up to 40 cm in parts of Lincolnshire.\n\n\n==== 2 December ====\n\nDuring the night of 1\u20132 December an extremely heavy belt of snow affected Southern England. Heavy and persistent snow started falling on the South Coast at around 8pm and on the morning of 2 December there were large snow depths reported widely all across East and West Sussex and parts of Kent, Surrey, Gloucestershire and Hampshire. Snow Depths:\nKent\nMeopham: 45 cm (18 in)\nSussex\nBrighton: 32 cm (13 in)\nSouth Downs: 60 cm (24 in)\nBurgess Hill: 35 cm (14 in)\nCrawley: 30 cm (12 in)\nHorsham: 35 cm (14 in)\nGloucestershire\nDrybrook: 56 cm (22 in)\nSurrey\nRedhill: 25 cm (10 in)*\nEpsom: 33 cm (13 in)*\nKenley: 37 cm (15 in)*\nSelsdon: 36 cm (14 in)*\nHampshire\nSouthampton: 20 cm (8 in)\nPetersfield: 25 cm (10 in)\n* - Total from 30 November to 2 December\nSnow also affected Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, with accumulations locally reaching 30\u201340 cm (12\u201316 in). Level snow depths of up to 70 cm (28 in) were reported in places in Scotland, with 71 cm (28 in) at Bathgate, West Lothian.\n\n\n==== 3 December ====\nAn all-time record low of -17.9 \u00b0C recorded at RAF Leeming (since records began at Leeming in 1945) and -19.0 \u00b0C at RAF Topcliffe in North Yorkshire.\n\n\n==== 6 December ====\nHeavy snowfall in the Central Belt in Scotland led to the closure of the M8 motorway for two days with hundreds of motorists stranded overnight. The resulting political furore led to the resignation of Scottish Minister for Transport, Stewart Stevenson.\n\n\n==== 9 December ====\nMilder north westerly winds initiated a rapid thaw; this was to be a sudden end to a dramatic cold spell for most until cold conditions returned later in the month.\n\n\n==== 15 December ====\nFrom late evening, a cold front reached the Shetland Isles and moved southwards across Scotland overnight. Mild air preceded the front, with cold air straight from the Arctic following it, resulting in some rapid temperature drops throughout Scotland and its Isles overnight. An unofficial temperature of 11.6 \u00b0C, the highest of the month so far, was recorded near Lairg, Scottish Highlands at around 7pm in the milder air.\n\n\n==== 16 December ====\nThe cold front continued to move southwards across the UK passing Northern Ireland and Northern England during the morning and into midday, and reaching central and then southern parts of the UK during the afternoon and into the evening. However, relatively little snow actually settled across most of the UK, due to the short-lived nature of the snow showers associated with the front. Areas of Northern Scotland in particular did receive upwards of 30 cm of snow during the day, resulting in many school closures and disruption to transport.\n\n\n==== 17 December ====\nThe Met Office issued an extreme weather warning for Northern Ireland and North Wales as very heavy snow showers brought by a northerly wind made conditions dangerous and dumped over 30 cm of snow in many places. Heavy snow began to fall in Devon and approximately 8 cm of heavy snow also fell in Manchester.\n\n\n==== 18 December ====\n\nFollowing overnight snow showers, a band of snow organised itself stretching from Anglesey to the West Midlands during the day, resulting in 10\u201315 cm (4\u20136 inches) lying in a wide area from Shropshire to around Coventry, and south into Warwickshire and parts of Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. 20 cm (8 inches) was reported from higher ground south of Birmingham. The M5 was gridlocked, and shops in the Birmingham area closed early on the last Saturday before Christmas. A number of passengers travelling by coach had to spend the night at Birmingham Coach Station due too not only coaches for onwards destinations being unable to depart and arrive Birmingham, but also widespread disruption to train services making onwards alternatives impossible.\nSnow also fell to the southeast, including London and Oxfordshire, with Heathrow Airport closing its runways for a time leading to long delays. On one of the busiest Christmas shopping days of the season, Brent Cross Shopping Centre was closed. Overnight, temperatures plunged to as low as -8 \u00b0C in parts of South East England and Greater London.\n\n\n==== 19 December ====\n\nA minimum temperature of -19.6 \u00b0C was recorded in Shawbury, Shropshire. Heathrow airport continued to be affected with only 20 flights from a scheduled 1300 taking off. Heavy snow affected North East England, with 10\u201315 cm in south Northumberland.\n\n\n==== 20 December ====\nA minimum temperature of -17.6 \u00b0C was recorded at Castlederg, a new record for Northern Ireland and -19.6 \u00b0C was recorded at Chesham, Buckinghamshire. Heavy snow fall was also reported over large parts of Devon causing major travel disruption.\n\n\n==== 21 December ====\n\nDublin Airport and City of Derry Airport were forced to fully close, 15 cm (6 inches) of snow was recorded at Dublin Airport. The band of snow dumped several more centimeters over an area stretching from North Wales, through parts of Cheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and into the West Midlands by the morning of the 22nd.\n\n\n==== 23 December ====\nOnly three days after breaking the record minimum for Northern Ireland, Castlederg broke the record again with a low of -18.7 \u00b0C. Meanwhile, further snow showers affected North East England, but fresh accumulations only reached around 5 cm.\n\n\n==== 24 December ====\nOn the 24th, it was decided to cancel the 27th IRFU's Celtic League meeting with Leinster as Ulster's Ravenhill pitch froze under heavy snow. Both northern and southern Ireland were under heavy snow. Bitterly cold with thick snow fall in many places, and scattered, mainly light snow showers in the North and East. Later in the day, a band of more persistent and heavy snow reached northern and western Scotland, resulting in further accumulations of several cm of snow. 63 cm of lying snow was reported at Braemar, Aberdeenshire.\n\n\n==== 25 December ====\n\nSnow fell in many parts of Scotland giving the country two consecutive White Christmases. Venus well elongated as a morning star provided a bright Christmas star. It was also the coldest Christmas Day, with a CET of -5.9 \u00b0C, since Christmas Day 1830.\nThe Republic of Ireland's lowest-ever December temperature on record was recorded on this date. The mercury plummeted to -17.5 \u00b0C at Straide, County Mayo.\n27 centimetres of lying snow are recorded at Casement Aerodrome weather station in Dublin.\n\n\n==== 28 December ====\nThousands of homes and businesses in Northern Ireland and Wales were without water as melting snow and ice revealed many burst pipes. Northern Ireland Water said it was alternating supplies from reservoirs in order to help alleviate the crisis in which some properties had been without supplies since before Christmas.\n\n\n=== January 2011 ===\nJanuary again was colder than average across the UK, though much milder than December, with a mean temperature across the UK of 3.1 \u00b0C. In contrast to December, it was dry across most of the country (except South East England which was wetter than average). It had more frost than average across most of the UK. However, freezing rain caused disruption in Shropshire, and Greater Manchester experienced heavy overnight snow which affected travel on the morning of the 4th. and snow fell in the West Midlands and parts of Wales, Cheshire and Lancashire on 7 January.\nWelsh flood warnings stay in place in four areas, with roads closed after heavy bursts of rain affecting Conwy and Gwynedd. By 15.55 GMT, there were four flood warnings and six flood alerts 16 January 2011.\n\n\n=== February 2011 ===\nFebruary was a mild month (the 9th mildest in the last 100 years) with very little frost and much of the country having its first snow-free February since 1998. The only significant wintry weather came on the 18th-21st when some overnight dustings of snow fell as far south as the Midlands.\n\n\n=== March 2011 ===\nHeavy snow once again started to cover parts of Scotland, affecting travel from 9 March, with fresh snowfalls bringing more travel disruption on 12 March. Persistent snow affected much of the Highlands of Scotland during the 12th-13th of the month, with reports of 40 cm of lying snow near Fort William and 60 cm of lying snow to the north of Aviemore, with severe drifting.\n\n\n== Weather statistics and records ==\nIn the UK it was the coldest December ever, since Met Office records began in 1910, with a mean temperature of -1 \u00b0C. It broke the previous record of 0.1 \u00b0C in December 1981.\nDecember 2010 has the lowest CET, -0.7 \u00b0C, since a CET of -1.1 \u00b0C was recorded for February 1986. December 2010 can also be confirmed to be the coldest December for 120 years, since a monthly CET of -0.8 \u00b0C was recorded for December 1890 and the second-coldest December since records began in 1659. Probably the most notable record of the winter is the new all-time record low for Northern Ireland, of -18.7 \u00b0C recorded on 23 December at Castlederg, County Tyrone. In addition, all of these sites recorded their all-time record lows since recording began, this winter:\nAndrewsfield at -13.8 \u00b0C on 20 December\nAultbea at -8.5 \u00b0C on 18 December\nBallykelly at -13.3 \u00b0C on 23 December\nBelfast Aldergrove Airport at -14.9 \u00b0C on 21 December\nCapel Curig at -17.5 \u00b0C on 20 December\nCarlisle lowest maximum of -7.9 \u00b0C on 8 December\nChurch Fenton at -17.5 \u00b0C on 3 December\nCranfield at -12 \u00b0C on 20 December\nCrosby at -17.6 \u00b0C on 21 December\nDishforth at -15 \u00b0C on 6 December\nDunkeswell Aerodrome at -9.2 \u00b0C on 19 December\nExeter Airport at -16.5 \u00b0C on 26 December\nFarnborough at -14.2 \u00b0C on 20 December\nGravesend-Broadness at -10.5 \u00b0C on 20 December\nHawarden at -12.6 \u00b0C on 20 December\nHereford Credenhill at -15.8 \u00b0C on 26 December\nHolbeach at -9.8 \u00b0C on 7 December\nHumberside at -14 \u00b0C on 7 December\nRAF Leeming at -17.9 \u00b0C on 3 December\nLinton-on-Ouse at -17.3 \u00b0C on 3 December\nRedesdale Camp at -19.2 \u00b0C on 3 December\nRAF Scampton at -13.6 \u00b0C on 3 December\nStrathallan at -19 \u00b0C on 3 December\nRAF Topcliffe at -19.0 \u00b0C on 3 December\nWarcop at -11.7 \u00b0C on 21 December\n\n\n== See also ==\nJanuary 2013 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall\nCarmen (storm)\nWinter of 2010\u20132011 in Europe\n2010 Albania floods\n2010 West African floods\n2010 Central European floods\n2010 Var floods\n2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat wave\nArctic dipole anomaly\nArctic oscillation\nCyclogenesis\nFlood control in the Netherlands\nGulf Stream\nMuddy flood\nWinter storm\nXynthia (storm)\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Thomas Andrews Drake (born 1957) is a former senior executive of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), a decorated United States Air Force and United States Navy veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010, the government alleged that Drake mishandled documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project. He is the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling and co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award.\nOn June 9, 2011, all 10 original charges against him were dropped. Drake rejected several deals because he refused to \"plea bargain with the truth\". He eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer; Jesselyn Radack of the Government Accountability Project, who helped represent him, called it an act of \"civil disobedience.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nDrake's father was a World War II veteran and his mother a secretary for Pearl S. Buck. He entered the U.S. Air Force in 1979, becoming an Airborne Voice Processing Specialist, with a fluency in German, and went on ELINT (electronic intelligence) missions. It was in that capacity that he encountered the surveillance state of East Germany and the Stasi, which informed his worldview and to which he compares developments in the United States since the September 11 attacks. Drake left the Air Force in 1989. He was also in the U.S. Navy, where he analyzed intelligence for the National Military Joint Intelligence Center. According to the Washington Post, he also at one time worked with the CIA. In 1989, Drake began work as an NSA contractor, evaluating software. As a contractor, he worked on projects like JACKPOT and LIBRARIAN, becoming an expert in the quality-testing of software and working on a system for measuring the quality of computer code at the NSA. Drake also continued his academic studies.\nIn 2000, he was hired as a software systems quality specialist and management and information technology consultant for Columbia, Maryland-based Costal Research & Technology Inc. (CRTI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexandria, Virginia-based Computer Systems Management, Inc. (CSMI). In late 2001, he went to work at the NSA as a full-time employee at the Signals Intelligence Directorate at Fort Meade, Maryland, with his actual first day on the job as an NSA employee being September 11, 2001. In 2002, he became a Technical Director for Software Engineering Implementation within the Cryptologic Systems and Professional Health Office. In 2003, Drake became a Process Portfolio Manager within NSA's newly formed Directorate of Engineering. He held a Top Secret security clearance. During the congressional investigations into 9/11, he testified about NSA failures. In 2006 he was reassigned to the National Defense University, where he became the NSA Chair and an Assistant Professor of Behavioral Sciences within the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF). Drake was forced to leave the NDU in 2007 when his security clearance was suspended, and he resigned from the NSA the next year. Drake then went to work at Strayer University but was forced from that job after his indictment of April 2010. He found work at an Apple Store. He then founded Knowpari Systems, a consulting firm.\nIn 2011, Drake was awarded the Ridenhour Prize for Truth Telling and was co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award. Accepting the SAAII award he said, with references to an 1857 speech of Frederick Douglass:\n\n\n== Whistleblowing on Trailblazer, and government response ==\n\n\n=== Drake action within the NSA ===\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the NSA desired new tools to collect intelligence from the growing flood of information pouring out of the new digital networks like the internet. Drake became involved in the internal NSA debate between two of these tools, the Trailblazer Project and the ThinThread project. He became part of the \"minority\" that favored ThinThread for several reasons, including its theoretical ability to protect the privacy of US individuals while gathering intelligence. Trailblazer required billions of dollars, dwarfing the cost of ThinThread. Drake eventually became \"disillusioned, then indignant\" regarding the problems he saw at the agency. Around 2000, NSA head Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer over ThinThread; ThinThread was cancelled and Trailblazer ramped up, eventually employing IBM, SAIC, Boeing, CSC, and others.\nDrake worked his way through the legal processes that are prescribed for government employees who believe that questionable activities are taking place in their departments. In accordance with whistleblower protection laws such as the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, Drake complained internally to the designated authorities: to his bosses, the NSA Inspector General, the Defense Department Inspector General, and both the House and Senate Congressional intelligence committees.\nHe also kept in contact with Diane Roark, a staffer for the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Congress (the House committee responsible for oversight of the executive branch's intelligence activities). Roark was the \"staff expert\" on the NSA's budget, and the two of them had met in 2000.\nIn September 2002, Roark and three former NSA officials, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Ed Loomis, filed a DoD Inspector General report regarding problems at NSA, including Trailblazer. Drake was a major source for the report, and gave information to DoD during its investigation of the matter. Roark tried to notify her superior, then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Porter Goss. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time. In addition, Roark made an effort to inform Vice President Dick Cheney's legal counsel David Addington, who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s. Addington was later revealed by a Washington Post report to be the author of the controlling legal and technical documents for the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program, typing the documents on a Tempest-shielded computer across from his desk in room 268 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and storing them in a vault in his office. Roark got no response from all three men.\n\n\n=== NSA own inquiry and acknowledgement ===\nBy 2003, the NSA Inspector General (IG) had declared Trailblazer an expensive failure. It cost more than 1 billion dollars.\nIn 2004, the DoD IG produced a final report of its investigation that had been prompted by Roark & the others in 2002. The report basically agreed with their assertions and found very serious flaws at NSA. For a time, the NSA was even banned from starting projects over a certain size, for fear it would waste the money. However, there were no plans to release this DoD IG report to the public at the time.\n\n\n=== Eventual whistleblowing ===\nIn a 2011 New Yorker article, journalist Jane Mayer wrote that Drake felt the NSA was committing serious crimes against the American people, on a level worse than what President Nixon had done in the 1970s. Drake reviewed the laws regarding disclosure of information, and decided that if he revealed unclassified information to a reporter, then the worst thing that would happen to him was probably that he would be fired.\nIn November 2005, Drake contacted Siobhan Gorman of The Baltimore Sun newspaper, sending her emails through Hushmail and discussing various topics. He claims that he was very careful not to give her sensitive or classified information; it was one of the basic ground rules he set out at the beginning of their communication. This communication occurred around 2006. Gorman wrote several articles about waste, fraud, and abuse at the NSA, including articles on Trailblazer. She received an award from the Society of Professional Journalists for her series exposing government wrongdoing. Judge Richard Bennett later ruled that \"there is no evidence that Reporter A relied upon any allegedly classified information found in Mr. Drake's house in her articles\".\n\n\n=== 2007 FBI raids ===\nIn July 2007, armed FBI agents raided the homes of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe, the same people who had filed the complaint with the DoD Inspector General in 2002. Binney claims they pointed guns at his wife and himself. Wiebe said it reminded him of the Soviet Union. None of these people were charged with any crimes. In November 2007, there was a raid on Drake's residence. His computers, documents, and books were confiscated. He was never charged with giving any sensitive information to anyone; the charge actually brought against him is for 'retaining' information (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(e)). The FBI tried to get Roark to testify against Drake; she refused. Reporter Gorman was not contacted by the FBI.\nDrake initially cooperated with the investigation, telling the FBI about the alleged illegality of the NSA's activities. The government created a 'draft indictment' of Drake, prepared by prosecutor Steven Tyrrell. It listed charges as \"disclosing classified information to a newspaper reporter and for conspiracy\". Diane Roark, Binney, Wiebe, and Loomis (the complainants to the DoD IG in 2002) were also allegedly listed as \"unindicted co-conspirators\". In 2009 a new prosecutor came on the case, William Welch II, and changed the indictment. Some charges were removed, as was any naming of 'co-conspirators'. The new case only contained charges against Drake.\nProsecutors wanted Drake to plead guilty, but he refused. He believed that he was innocent of the charges against him. The government wanted him to help prosecute the other whistleblowers. He refused this as well. He later explained his motivations to the Ridenhour Prizes organization:\n\nI did what I did because I am rooted in the faith that my duty was to the American people ... I knew that you did not spy on Americans and that we were accountable for spending American taxpayer monies wisely.\n\n\n=== Indictment ===\nIn April 2010, Drake was indicted by a Baltimore, Maryland grand jury on the following charges:\nWillful Retention of National Defense Information 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(e) (5 counts)\n(793(e) is a modification of the Espionage Act of 1917 made under the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950)\n\nObstructing justice 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519 (1 count)\nMaking a False Statement 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a) (4 counts)\nThe indictment contained many other allegations; most of them did not relate to the actual charges against him. He was not specifically charged with unauthorized disclosure of classified information, nor was he charged at all under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 798, the \"SIGINT\" statute. The indictment gave details about his communications with Roark and with Gorman, but he was not charged with any crime directly relating to those communications. The indictment also did not list the names of Gorman or Roark, but they were confirmed by reporters (e.g. Mark Hosenball of Newsweek). Roark's lawyer claimed that the indictment contains a \"mischaracterization of the facts\" about the relationship between her client and Drake. Roark herself later spoke out in support of Drake and the other whistleblowers of the Trailblazer project.\nThe \"willful retention\" charges regarded five documents allegedly \"related to the national defense\" that were found at Drake's residence. The five documents in question were referred to as \"What a Success,\" \"the Regular Meetings,\" \"Volume is our Friend,\" \"Trial and Testing,\" and \"Collections Sites.\" \"What a Success\" was declassified a few months after Drake was indicted, and should never have been classified in the first place, according to an official complaint filed by J. William Leonard, a former director of the Information Security Oversight Office. \"Regular Meetings\" was marked \"UNCLASSIFIED\" and posted on NSANet but prosecution argues the defendant should have known it was really classified. Drake's team also argued that the latter three of the five named documents were part of a collection of thousands of unclassified papers related to the DoD Inspector General Report (mentioned above). Drake's defense attorneys argued this meant that the defendant brought home the material accidentally, not \"willfully.\"\nThe obstruction charge was related to Drake allegedly deleting documents while he was purportedly aware that the FBI was investigating leaks to the media, and that the FBI was contemplating investigating leaks to Siobhan Gorman of The Baltimore Sun. The false statements charge was filed in relation to the FBI's questioning of Drake without a lawyer present in the initial stages of the investigation when he was cooperating with them. One count is for alleged statements made by him regarding whether he had willfully taken certain documents home. Another count is for allegedly lying about the purported transmission of classified information to Gorman. Drake's defenders point out that the government's own expert found that he had not destroyed any evidence. They also point out that Drake was careful not to give any classified information to Gorman, and that many of the documents in question were 'retroactively classified' after they were seized from his home by the FBI.\nThe federal offices involved in filing the indictment included the DOJ Public Integrity Section, DOJ Criminal Division, DOJ National Security Division, the FBI, and the NSA Office of Security & Counterintelligence. Drake was represented by James Wyda and Deborah Boardman, federal public defenders.\nDrake was also a client of the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower non-profit. Jesselyn Radack, director of Homeland Security and Human Rights for GAP, worked with Drake. Author and NSA authority James Bamford was a consultant for Drake's defense as well.\nGovernment prosecutor William M. Welch II, who had previously been charged with contempt and removed from the Ted Stevens case, served as the government's initial Senior Litigation Counsel, John P. Pearson of the DOJ Public Integrity Section was the government's Trial Attorney, and Lanny A. Breuer was in charge of overseeing the prosecution.\nFederal Judge Richard D. Bennett was responsible for hearing handling the case, and initially set trial for June 2011.\nThe Drake case has been written about in the Washington Post, the New York Times, Agence France-Press, Newsweek, Wired, the Washingtonian.com, the Federation of American Scientists' Secrecy News, Politico, and elsewhere. Jesselyn Radack, of the Government Accountability Project, has also discussed the case.\nThe U.S. government publicly stated that the prosecution of Thomas Drake was not intended to deter government employees from reporting problems. \"Whistle-blowers are the key to many, many department investigations\u2014we don't retaliate against them, we encourage them,\" Matthew A. Miller, a spokesman for the Justice Department, said. \"This indictment was brought on the merits, and nothing else.\"\n\n\n==== Court proceedings ====\nIn the spring of 2011, the prosecution made several moves to restrict the normally open proceedings of a jury trial in a United States courtroom, as reported by Gerstein at Politico and others. This was done under the legal auspices of the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), which attempts in theory to prevent the release of classified information during open trials. The prosecution also moved to use the controversial \"silent witness rule,\" in which exhibits are hidden from the public by the use of \"code words\" in court. The government had only attempted to use the rule a handful of times previously; its legality has been challenged under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The government also moved to restrict cross-examination of witnesses, to restrict jurors from reading the Siobhan Gorman Baltimore Sun articles about problems with NSA and Trailblazer, and to prevent the defense from making arguments or introducing evidence to the courtroom about whistleblowing or overclassification.\nIn addition, the prosecution also had the court seal two exhibits the defense had already published in one of its public court filings, which listed various documents the prosecution would try to use at trial.\nThe prosecution argued that the CIPA also applied to non-classified information and attempted to have unclassified information presented at trial in redacted form only.\n\n\n===== Government arguments =====\nReferring to Siobhan Gorman's Baltimore Sun news stories, the government legally pleaded that the \"newspaper articles are unduly prejudicial. The only purpose for the admission of these newspaper articles is to put NSA on trial.\" The prosecution also contended that it had no legal obligation to prove Drake's intent to harm national security, saying that it \"does not have to prove that defendant intended to harm the country\" under the specific part of the Espionage Act that Drake was charged with; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(e). As for the 'overclassification' defense, the government argued that such a defense claim would be 'confusing to the jury' and thus irrelevant to the charges. The government also argued that any discussion at trial of the legal concept of whistle-blowing would likewise be irrelevant to the charges.\n\n\n===== Final disposition =====\nIn early June, shortly after the May 22, 2011, broadcast of a 60 Minutes episode on the Drake case, the government dropped all of the charges against Drake and agreed not to seek any jail time in return for Drake's agreement to plead guilty to a single misdemeanor of misusing the agency's computer system.\nAt the July sentencing hearing the presiding judge, Richard D. Bennett of Maryland's Federal District Court, issued harsh words for the government, saying that it was \"unconscionable\" to charge a defendant, two years after his home was searched, with a list of serious crimes that could have resulted in 35 years in prison, only to drop the 10 counts of the indictment on the eve of trial. Expressing his \"irritation\" with the prosecution, Bennett also completely rejected the government's request for a $50,000 fine, despite the sentencing guidelines recommending a fine of $500-$5,000. He noted that Drake had been financially devastated, spending $82,000 on his defense, losing his $154,600 job at the NSA and his pension, and being fired from his university teaching position. He sentenced Drake to one year of probation and 240 hours of community service.\n\n\n=== Since 2012 ===\nDrake appeared on The Daily Show on August 6, 2012, to talk about the history of his case, and in September sent an audio message of support to CryptoParty.\nOn March 15, 2013, Drake spoke at a National Press Club Luncheon about the national intelligence community and its attitude towards whistle-blowing.\nDrake inspired Edward Snowden to leak information on the NSA spying program PRISM in June 2013. Snowden went public rather than reporting within the system due to the reprisals against Drake (and other whistleblowers), which led the Assistant Defense Dept Inspector General (DoD IG) in charge of the whistleblower unit, John Crane, to himself become a whistleblower when it became apparent that Drake's identity had been leaked by DoD IG to the Justice Dept.\nDrake has become an activist against the surveillance state, frequently giving interviews and speaking at events such as Restore the Fourth. One of the themes of his speeches and interviews is a \"privacy exercise\" as follows \"Put your entire life in a box, your documents, bank accounts, your passwords, everything\u2014and give it to a complete stranger\u2014a fellow American for safekeeping. Would you do it?\" he states that he has yet to encounter a \"yes.\"\nIn a September 2013 interview, Drake re-affirmed his belief that the problems of the NSA are so chronic and systemic that the only solution would be to completely dismantle and subsequently rebuild the entire organization.\nOn July 3, 2014, Drake along with former Technical Director of the NSA, William Binney gave testimony to the German Parliamentary Committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. He described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German secret service BND.\nOn November 10, 2015, Drake appeared on a PEN American Center panel at the Newseum about \"Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression.\"\n\n\n== Espionage Act and whistleblowing ==\nDrake is one of four individuals in the history of the United States who has been charged specifically with \"willful retention\" of \"national defense\" information under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793(e). Most prosecutions are for \"delivery\" of classified information to a third party\u2014something that Drake was not charged with. This particular portion of the Espionage Act was created in 1950 during the Second Red Scare, as part of the McCarran Internal Security Act. Anthony Russo and Daniel Ellsberg were the first to be prosecuted for the \"retention\" of what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers, which Ellsberg gave to the New York Times, eventually resulting in another landmark Espionage Act case in 1971, New York Times Co. v. United States. The prosecution of Russo and Ellsberg was dismissed in 1972 because of government misconduct. The second prosecution was of Samuel Loring Morison in 1985, a Navy analyst who sold satellite photographs to Jane's Defense Weekly; he was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton. The third was the American Israel Public Affairs Committee case in 2005, United States v. Franklin, Rosen, and Weissman.\n\n\n== Founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity ==\nDrake is a founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity. In September 2015, Drake and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency's use of torture.\n\n\n== Related media works ==\nIn 2014, a documentary called Silenced, in which Drake was featured, was released. It was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2016. Having an analogous theme as the Oscar-winning documentary Citizenfour, which portrays similar treatment of Edward Snowden, Silenced has been the official selection and recipient of several awards from multiple film festivals even before its release to major cable networks in March 2015.\nAlso in 2014, Drake's involvement with Thinthread, his subsequent indictment, etc., along with others associated with his activities (Roark, Binney, Wiebe, Loomis), and Snowden were featured in a PBS documentary, \"United States of Secrets\".\nDrake is featured throughout the 2016 documentary Nothing to Hide, regarding government surveillance and internet privacy.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEdward Snowden\nMark Klein\nThomas Tamm\nRuss Tice\nPerry Fellwock\nStephen Jin-Woo Kim\nJeffrey Alexander Sterling\nChelsea Manning\nWen Ho Lee\nPRISM (surveillance program)\nWhistleblower Protection Act\nThomas Andrews Drake Whitehouse Petition\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThomas A.

            "content": "La ricotta (\"Curd Cheese\") is a short film written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini in 1962 and is part of the omnibus film Ro.Go.Pa.G. It is often considered the most memorable portion of Ro.Go.Pa.G and the height of Pasolini's creative powers and social criticism.\n\n\n== Plot and issues ==\nIn summary, the film deals with the film production of the Passion of Jesus with a director acting like Pasolini yet played by Orson Welles. The most biting social critique is shown through the main character of Stracci (meaning \"rags\"). Stracci is a poor and starving man who works as an extra (ironically, the \"good thief\") who is not given pity or mercy. Stracci tries everything to get something to eat and he finally does. Unfortunately the ricotta cheese he avidly gorges on, combined with the awkward position he's forced to assume while being \"crucified\" in front of the camera prove a fatal combination and he dies from indigestion. Stracci represents the poor and the marginalized people, \"the ones who hunger for bread\" who, according to Pasolini, are neglected by a society, which prides itself on being Christian. Thus, in this view, the Roman Catholicism of Italy is more concerned with status and prominence than helping the poor, a teaching of Christ that Pasolini admired greatly.\nThe production of the Passion, done outside of Rome, represents a corrupted society who is interested in superficial beauty and yet possesses a corrupted core. This is demonstrated with the extras' lack of interest with the film itself, preferring instead to dance to ya-ya twist music, lying around during break time and tormenting Stracci. This is also demonstrated in the elaborate poses the director has set up, evoking the great Italian Renaissance, particularly of Pontormo and Fiorentino and yet are far from respected.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nPasolini, in a disclaimer tacked in the beginning of \"La ricotta,\" affirms that the event narrated, the Passion, is the greatest event ever occurred, and as in The Gospel According to St. Matthew, stressed that he held in great respect the Christian heritage. Despite this assertion, Pasolini was accused of holding contempt for the state religion and was sentenced four months of conviction, which he avoided by paying a fine . The sentence was later declared void by an appeals court.\n\n\n== Resources ==\nThe film is more easily available as a supplement on the Mamma Roma DVD available through the Criterion Collection\n\"Pasolini, Mamma Roma and 'La ricotta'\" by Gary Indiana\nPasolini by Enzo Siciliano\nPasolini on Pasolini, interviews by Oswald Stacks\n\"Pasolini, La ricotta.

            "content": "A world championship is generally an international sports competition open to elite competitors from around the world, representing their nations, and winning such an event will be considered the highest or near highest achievement in the sport or contest.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe title is usually awarded through a combination of specific contests or, less commonly, ranking systems (e.g. the ICC Test Championship), or a combination of the two (e.g. World Triathlon Championships in Triathlon). This determines a 'world champion', who or which is commonly considered the best nation, team, individual (or other entity) in the world in a particular field, although the vagaries of sport ensure that the competitor recognised at the best in an event is not always the 'world champion' (see Underdog).\nCertain sports do not have a world championship. Instead, they may organise a world cup competition, or they may organize both, for example cycling (UCI World Championships and UCI World Cups)). Often, the use of the term cup or championship in this sense is just a choice of words. Some sports have multiple champions because of multiple organizations, such as boxing, mixed martial arts and wrestling.\nCertain sports do not have a world championship or a world cup as such, but may have one or several world champions. Professional boxing, for example, has several world champions at different weights, but each one of them is decided by a \"title fight\", not a tournament.\nA certain number of sports hold world championships or world cups which are overshadowed, in terms of prestige, by the same events in the Olympic Games, the most prestigious multi-sports event.\nStill other sports may or may not have a true world championship but may designate the winners of a domestic competition to be \"world champions.\" This is especially true of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada; world cups and championships exist in all of the major sports, but the domestic U.S. and Canadian leagues are generally nicknamed as the world professional championships or the equivalent of a world club championship. (In American football, although an IFAF World Championship exists, the United States is so far above and beyond the other nations it faces that the winner of the U.S.-based Super Bowl, a competition limited to the 32 teams in the National Football League, is commonly nicknamed as the world champion by the players, the press and fans alike; the NFL itself explicitly marketed the contest as a world championship in its first iterations.)\nFinally, certain professional sports do not have a world championship or world cup, but rather hold a series of events recognised as the elite level in their field (e.g. tennis has a series of four Grand Slam events recognised as the pinnacle of the game, in addition to key team events, world tour finals and the Olympic Games, though each year ITF designates a World Champion based on performances throughout the year).\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n== Best sportsperson by sport ==\nThis table includes medals for both individual and team events.

It lies along local roads near the North Platte River, northeast of the city of Ogallala, the county seat of Keith County. Its elevation is 3,100 feet (945 m). Although Keystone is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 69144.\n\n\n== History ==\nKeystone had its start by the building of the Union Pacific Railroad through that territory.\n\n\n=== Historical site ===\nKeystone is home to the Little Church at Keystone, designed by Thomas R. Kimball and built in 1908. The town was too small to hold two churches, so several community members funded the construction through bake sales. The church has a Catholic altar on one end, a Protestant lectern at the other, and hinged pews to make the seats reversible.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Manchester is one of the principal cities of the United Kingdom, gaining city status in 1853, thus becoming the first new city in over 300 years since Bristol in 1542. Often regarded as the first industrialised city, Manchester was a city built by the Industrial Revolution and had little pre-medieval history to speak of. Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.\nAs its population and influence burgeoned, Manchester became a centre for new discoveries, scientific breakthroughs and technological developments in engineering. A famous but unattributed quote linked to Manchester is: \"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow\". Pioneering breakthroughs such as the first 'true' canal which spawned 'Canal Mania', the first intercity railway station which led to 'railway mania' and the first stored-program computer. The city has achieved great success in the field of physics, with the electron (J. J. Thomson, 1897), proton (Rutherford, 1917), neutron (James Chadwick, 1934) all being discovered by scientists educated (Chadwick and Rutherford) or born (Thomson) in Manchester.\nFamous scientists to have studied in Manchester include John Dalton, James Prescott Joule, J. J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick and Alan Turing. A creative and often seen as a bohemian city, Manchester also had the highest number of patent applications per head of population in the United Kingdom in 2003. The city is served by the University of Manchester, previously UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester pre-2004. The university has a total of 25 Nobel Laureates; only the Oxbridge universities have more Nobel laureates. The city is also served by the Museum of Science and Industry celebrating Mancunian, as well as national achievements in both fields.\n\n\n== 17th century ==\n\nIn 1630, astronomer William Crabtree observed the transit of Venus. Crabtree was born in the hamlet of \"Broughton Spout\" which was on the east bank of the River Irwell, near the area now known as \"The Priory\" in Broughton and was educated at The Manchester Grammar School. He married into a wealthy family and worked as a merchant in Manchester. However, in his spare time, his great interest was astronomy. He carefully measured the movements of the planets and undertook precise astronomical calculations. With improved accuracy, he rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables of Planetary Positions.\nCrabtree corresponded with Jeremiah Horrocks (who sometimes spelt his name in the Latised form as Horrox), another enthusiastic amateur astronomer, from 1636. A group of astronomers from the north of England, which included William Gascoigne, formed around them and were Britain's first followers of the astronomy of Johannes Kepler. \"Nos Keplari\" as the group called themselves, were distinguished as being the first people to gain a realistic notion of the solar system's size. Crabtree and Horrocks were the only astronomers to observe, plot, and record the transit of the planet Venus across the Sun, as predicted by Horrocks, on 24 November 1639 (Julian calendar, or 4 December in the Gregorian calendar). They also predicted the next occurrence on 8 June 2004. The two correspondents both recorded the event in their own homes and it is not known whether they ever met in person, but Crabtree's calculations were crucial in allowing Horrocks to estimate the size of Venus and the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Unfortunately Horrocks died early in 1641 the day before he was due to meet Crabtree. Crabtree made his will on 19 July 1644, and was buried within the precincts of the Manchester Collegiate Church on 1 August 1644, close to where he had received his education.\n\n\n== 18th century ==\n\n\n=== The creation of the first economically successful canal ===\n\nThe Bridgewater Canal, opening in 1761 is generally regarded as the earliest successful canals. The Bridgewater Canal connects Runcorn, Manchester and Leigh, in North West England. It was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to transport coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester, and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh.\nThe Duke invested a large sum of money in the scheme. From Worsley to Manchester its construction cost \u00a3168,000 (equivalent to \u00a323,759,280 in 2016), but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half. This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as Canal Mania. Along with its stone aqueduct at Barton-upon-Irwell, the Bridgewater Canal was considered a major engineering achievement. One commentator wrote that when finished, \"[the canal] will be the most extraordinary thing in the Kingdom, if not in Europe. The boats in some places are to go underground, and in other places over a navigable river, without communicating with its waters ...\".\n\n\n== 19th century ==\n\nJohn Dalton, was born in Cumberland in 1766, a promising young scientist he moved to Manchester in 1793. He hypothesised the idea of \"colour blindness\", a theory which was alien to all as it had not been formally talked about before. Dalton hypothesised the idea from his own experience, as he suffered from discoloured eyesight himself. Dalton would go on to propose the Dalton atomic theory in which he hypothesised that elements were made of small particles called atoms.\n\nManchester Liverpool Road is a former railway station on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in Manchester, which opened on 15 September 1830. The L&MR station was the terminus of the world's first inter-city passenger railway in which all services were hauled by timetabled steam locomotives. It is now the world's oldest surviving terminal railway station. The station closed to passenger services on 4 May 1844  when the line was extended to join the Manchester and Leeds Railway at Hunt's Bank. Liverpool Road was superseded by Manchester Victoria railway station. Since Liverpool Road ceased operation, the oldest railway station still in use is Earlestown railway station which also opened on 15 September 1830. However the station is still preserved by the Museum of Science and Industry.\nRobert Angus Smith, a Scottish chemist visited Manchester in the 1840s. In his research in Manchester, Smith discovered the existence of acid rain, a by product of the industrial revolution. Smith consequently pushed for greater environmental awareness and helped to found the Noxious Vapours Abatement Society in Manchester, which raised awareness of the consequences of poor air.\n\n\n=== Joseph Whitworth ===\n\nJoseph Whitworth was an engineer and inventor who hailed from Stockport, Cheshire (now Greater Manchester). A talented mechanic amongst various other engineering roles, for long periods of his life, he worked in factories in Manchester. Whitworth would ultimately devise a standard screw thread system, the first of its kind in the world. The system he created in 1841 would become known as the British Standard Whitworth.\nWhitworth also invented the Whitworth rifle, which was a giant leap in the development of the rifle, delivering a shooting range which far exceeded any firearm available at the time. In the American Civil War Confederate troops equipped with barrel-length three power scopes mounted on the exceptionally accurate Whitworth rifle had been known to kill Union officers at ranges of about 800 yards (731.5m), an unheard-of distance at that time. Consequently, the Whitworth rifle is considered one of the earliest examples of a sniper rifle, if not the first. In recognition of his achievements, a number of buildings in Manchester are named after him as is Whitworth Street. As part of his bequest, the Whitworth Art Gallery was created in his honour.\n\n\n=== John Frederick Bateman and water supply ===\n\nBy the 1850s, Manchester had grown into an industrial city, but the alacrity of such development had placed great strain on the city's infrastructure. Engineering developments such as water supplies, sewers and transport links (typically via canals) would provide Manchester with the necessary supplies to move forward.\nIn the 1840s, the Manchester Corporation Water Works recommended that to the city corporation that an infrastructure to increase water supplies to cope with demand must be built. The obvious choice for this supply would come from areas of high rainfall and there were three choices which were close enough to Manchester. The Lake District, Peak District and Snowdonia are traditionally rainy areas with its numerous valleys, ideal for a large reservoir. This was rejected in favour of John Frederick Bateman's proposal to build a supply chain of six reservoirs in the Longdendale Valley to the east of Manchester.\nFurther feats of engineering were required to cope with Manchester's increasing demand for water. From 1890 to 1925, the Thirlmere Aqueduct was constructed from Thirlmere to Heaton Park Reservoir. At 96 miles long, it remains the longest tunnel in the world.\n\n\n=== Manchester Ship Canal ===\nIn the 1880s, plans for a new Manchester Ship Canal were proposed. The idea was championed by Manchester manufacturer Daniel Adamson, who arranged a meeting at his home, The Towers in Didsbury, on 27 June 1882. He invited the representatives of several Lancashire towns, local businessmen and politicians, and two civil engineers: Hamilton Fulton and Edward Leader Williams. Fulton's design was for a tidal canal, with no locks and a deepened channel into Manchester. With the city about 60 feet (18 m) above sea level, the docks and quays would have been well below the surrounding surface. Williams' plan was to dredge a channel between a set of retaining walls, and build a series of locks and sluices to lift incoming vessels up to Manchester. Both engineers were invited to submit their proposals, and Williams' plans were selected to form the basis of a bill to be submitted to Parliament later that year. The Manchester Ship Canal briefly became the longest ship canal in the world upon opening and at its peak in the 1960s, it was the third busiest port in Britain.\n\n\n=== Trafford Park ===\n\nAs the ship canal was opened in 1894, plans were afoot for a new industrial estate, the first of its kind in the world. Two years after the opening of the ship canal, financier Ernest Terah Hooley bought the 1,183-acre (4,790,000 m2) country estate belonging to Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford for \u00a3360,000 (equivalent to \u00a338.2 million in 2016). Hooley intended to develop the site, which was close to Manchester and at the end of the canal, as an exclusive housing estate, screened by woods from industrial units constructed along the 1.5-mile (2.4 km) frontage onto the canal.\nWith the predicted traffic for the canal slow to materialise, Hooley and Marshall Stevens (the general manager of the Ship Canal Company) came to see the benefits that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to both the ship canal and the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates, where he remained until 1930, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director.\nWithin five years Trafford Park, Europe's largest industrial estate, was home to forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were grain silos; the grain was used for flour and as ballast for ships carrying raw cotton. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the Manchester Blitz in 1940) was Europe's largest grain elevator. The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 it bought the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK's largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos.\nInland from the canal the British Westinghouse Electric Company bought 11 per cent of the estate. Westinghouse's American architect Charles Heathcote was responsible for much of the planning and design of their factory, which built steam turbines and turbo generators. By 1899 Heathcote had also designed fifteen warehouses for the Manchester Ship Canal Company. Engineering companies such as Ford and Metropolitan-Vickers had a large presence at Trafford Park alongside non-engineering companies such Kellogg's who remain to this day. Trafford Park was also home to the first Ford production plant for their revolutionary Model T car outside of the United States.\n\nDuring World War II, Trafford Park became an important centre for the manufacture and development in engineering in the aim of giving Britain a technological advantage over its enemies. Having an abandoned factory in Trafford Park, Ford of Britain was approached about the possibility of converting it into an aircraft engine production unit by Herbert Austin, who was in charge of the shadow factory plan. Building work on a new factory was started in May 1940 on a 118-acre (48 ha) site, while Ford engineers went on a fact finding mission to Derby. Their chief engineer commented to Sir Stanley Hooker that the tolerances used were far too wide for them, and so the 20,000 drawings would need to be redrawn to Ford tolerance levels, which took over a year. Ford's factory was built with two distinct sections to minimise potential bomb damage, it was completed in May 1941 and bombed in the same month. At first, the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour, and large numbers of women, youths and untrained men had to be taken on. Despite this, the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month later and it was building the engine at a rate of 200 per week by 1943, at which point the joint factories were producing 18,000 Merlins per year. Ford\u2019s investment in machinery and the redesign resulted in the 10,000 man-hours needed to produce a Merlin dropping to 2,727 in three years, while unit cost fell from \u00a36,540 in June 1941 to \u00a31,180 by the war\u2019s end. In his autobiography Not much of an Engineer, Sir Stanley Hooker states: \"... once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production, Merlins came out like shelling peas. The percentage of engines rejected by the Air Ministry was zero. Not one engine of the 30,400 produced was rejected ...\". Some 17,316 people worked at the Trafford Park plant, including 7,260 women and two resident doctors and nurses. Merlin production started to run down in August 1945, and finally ceased on 23 March 1946.\nThe Ship Canal is now past its heyday, but still sits at Europe's largest industrial estate, Trafford Park and there are plans to increase shipping. Its importance highlighted by the engineering achievement that was the Manchester Ship Canal, the only ship canal in Britain and growth of the first industrial estate in the world in Trafford Park.\n\n\n== 20th century ==\n\n\n=== The 'Nuclear Family' ===\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Manchester gained a pioneering reputation for a city at the centre of physics, namely in the field of nuclear physics. The 'Nuclear Family' was the alias given to a group of scientists who studied nuclear physics in Manchester. 'Family' highlights the consistent development through the generations in nuclear physics, beginning with Thomson in the late 18th century and ending with James Chadwick in the 1930s who discovered the neutron. Ernest Rutherford is often described as the 'father of nuclear physics', equally the same could be said of J. J. Thomson who discovered the electron and isotopes, and ultimately taught Rutherford who later go on to split the atom. Scientists who were part of the 'nuclear family' in Manchester included J. J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden, John Cockcroft and James Chadwick.\nJ. J. Thomson, a Manchester-born physicist hailing from Cheetham Hill, who enrolled to Owens College as a 14-year-old. Thomson would go on to discover the electron in 1897 and isotope, as well as inventing the mass spectrometer. All of which, contributed to his award of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. Thomson also proposed the plum pudding model, which was later confirmed as scientifically incorrect by Rutherford.\nIn 1907, Ernest Rutherford, a scientist who had been taught by Thomson at the University of Cambridge, moved to Manchester to become chair of physics at the Victoria University of Manchester. Rutherford hypothesised the Rutherford model, which was later improved on by Niels Bohr who proposed the Bohr model. Rutherford would later have a great influence on students such as Niels Bohr, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and James Chadwick. Rutherford's main work would come in 1917 when he would 'split the atom'.\n\n\n=== Aviation ===\n\nFrom the advent of aviation at the beginning of the 20th century, Manchester has been home to a number of famous aviation companies, most notably Avro.\nIn 1910, French aviator Louis Paulhan flew from London to Manchester in approximately 12 hours. Paulhan won the first Daily Mail aviation prizes who offered the prize in 1906.\nJack Alcock was born on 5 November 1892 at Seymour Grove, Old Trafford, Stretford, England. He attended St Thomas's primary school in Heaton Chapel, Stockport. He first became interested in flying at the age of seventeen. In 1910 he became an assistant to Works Manager Charles Fletcher, an early Manchester aviator and Norman Crossland, a motor engineer and founder of Manchester Aero Club. It was during this period that Alcock met the Frenchman Maurice Ducrocq who was both a demonstration pilot and UK sales representative for aero engines made by Spirito Mario Viale in Italy.\nDucrocq took Alcock on as a mechanic at the Brooklands aerodrome, Surrey, where he learned to fly at Ducrocq's flying school, gaining his pilot's licence there in November 1912. By summer 1914 he was proficient enough to compete in a Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and return air race, flying a Farman biplane. He landed at Trafford Park Aerodrome and flew back to Hendon the same day. Alcock became an experienced military pilot and instructor during World War I with the Royal Naval Air Service, although he was shot down during a bombing raid and taken prisoner in Turkey.\nAfter the war, Alcock wanted to continue his flying career and took up the challenge of attempting to be the first to fly directly across the Atlantic. Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown took off from St John's, Newfoundland, at 1:45 pm local time on 14 June 1919, and landed in Derrygimla bog near Clifden, Ireland, 16 hours and 12 minutes later on 15 June 1919 after flying 1,980 miles (3,186 km). The flight had been much affected by bad weather, making accurate navigation difficult; the intrepid duo also had to cope with turbulence, instrument failure and ice on the wings. The flight was made in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber, and won a \u00a310,000 prize offered by London's Daily Mail newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. His grave in Southern Cemetery, Manchester is marked by a large stone memorial alongside other famous Mancunian figures. He is buried in grave space \"Church of England, Section G, Grave Number 966\", alongside 4 other individuals: John Alcock, Mary Alcock, Edward Samson Alcock and Elsie Moseley.\nIn 1910, Eccles-born Alliott Verdon Roe founded Avro on at Brownsfield Mill on Great Ancoats Street in Manchester city centre. Alongside, Farnworth-born aircraft designer Roy Chadwick, Avro would go on to design some recognisable British aircraft of the 20th century. The Avro Lancaster bomber, devised for World War II was a redeveloped version of the Avro Manchester and subsequently became the most important British aircraft of the war alongside the Supermarine Spitfire.\n\n\n=== Astronomy ===\n\nIn the 1930s, Bernard Lovell, an astronomer moved to Manchester to become a research fellow on the cosmic ray research team at the Victoria University of Manchester. He spent war time years working on developing radar systems and the like to assist in the war effort. After the war, he continued his studies in cosmic rays, but background radiation and light in the large Manchester impeded his work. He decided to push for funding for a large radio telescope which would be based away from the city on the Cheshire Plain south of Manchester at the Jodrell Bank Observatory.\nFunding was granted from the Nuffield Foundation with some contribution from the government, and soon an 89-metre height structure, which was the largest telescope in the world at the time of construction, was operational in 1957.\nThe telescope became operational in October 1957, which was just before the launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. Only the Soviet hierarchy were aware of Sputnik and it was the Lovell Telescope which tracked the satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik's booster rocket by radar; it first located it just before midnight on 12 October 1957. It also located Sputnik 2's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957. Jodrell Bank continued tracking new artificial satellites in the following years, and also doubled up as a long range ballistic missile radar system, a beneficial trait which helped the telescope gain funding from the British government. The Jodrell Bank Observatory is currently operated by the University of Manchester and was nominated for UNESCO World Heritage Status in 2011.\n\n\n=== Computing ===\n\nIn December 1946, Stockport-born Frederic Calland Williams returned to Manchester to head the Electrical Engineering department at the Victoria University of Manchester. Williams also recruited Tom Kilburn, with whom he worked with at the Telecommunications Research Establishment during World War II. Both worked on perfecting the cathode ray tube which Kilburn worked on. They eventually came up with the Williams tube, which allowed the storage of binary data. Consequently both worked on the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed the 'Manchester Baby' and on the 21 June 1948, the Machine was switched on. Despite its low performance by modern standards - the 'baby' only had a 32-bit word length and a memory of 32 words - it was the first computer capable of storing data in the world and was breakthrough in the computer science world.\nThe 'Baby' had provided a feasible design and development began on a more, usable and practical computer in the Manchester Mark 1. Joined by Alan Turing, the university continued development and by October 1949, the Mark 1 was finished. The computer ran successfully, error-free, on the 16 and 17 June 1949. Thirty-five patents resulted from the computer and the successful implementation of an index register.\n\n\n=== First test-tube baby ===\n\nIn 1978, after a decade of research by Manchester-born Robert G. Edwards and his colleague, Patrick Steptoe, Louise Brown, the world's first baby conceived by in vitro fertilisation. Louise Brown, was born at 11:47 pm on 25 July 1978 at the Oldham General Hospital and made medical history: in vitro fertilization meant a new way to help infertile couples who formerly had no possibility of having a baby.\nRefinements in technology have increased pregnancy rates and it is estimated that in 2010 about 4 million children have been born by IVF with approximately 170,000 coming from donated oocyte and embryos  In 2010, Robert G. Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for the development of in vitro fertilization\".\n\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n\n=== Graphene ===\nIn 2010, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, physicists at the University of Manchester won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on graphene. Successfully isolated in 2004, research and development continues on the 'miracle material' today to find practical, everyday uses for the material. The following year in 2011, the British government announced \u00a350 million of funding to allow further development of graphene in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMuseum of Science and Industry, Manchester\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\nHylton, Stuart (2003).

A 6'8\" power forward, Hod\u017ei\u0107 played college basketball for Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee. Hod\u017ei\u0107 is notable both for winning the Atlantic Sun Conference Player of the Year and for leading the NCAA in field goal percentage as a junior in the 2009\u201310 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.\n\n\n== High school ==\nHod\u017ei\u0107 and his family emigrated from war-torn Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994 after Adnan needed treatment for an eye injury sustained while playing with a friend. Ultimately settling in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., Hod\u017ei\u0107 attended North Central High School with future NBA player Eric Gordon. Back injuries kept him from competing on the AAU circuit, keeping him off the radar of major conference programs. Hod\u017ei\u0107 chose to attend Lipscomb University and play for coach Scott Sanderson.\n\n\n== College ==\nAfter making the Atlantic Sun all-freshman team in his first year at Lipscomb, Hod\u017ei\u0107 became one of the top post players in the conference as a sophomore. He averaged 16.5 points and 6.8 rebounds per game and made the all-conference first team. In his junior year, Hod\u017ei\u0107 really broke out, leading the Bisons to a share of the Atlantic Sun regular season championship.

            "content": "Show and Tell (also known as Show & Tell) is the American band Silvertide's full-length debut album. Produced by Oliver Leiber and mixed by Kevin \"Caveman\" Shirley, the band released it on September 28, 2004. Show and Tell features a melodic hard rock style deliberately reminiscent of the aggressive work done by groups achieving prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, examples being AC/DC, Aerosmith, and Led Zeppelin.\nIt was distributed by the label J Records. A commercial success, the album spawned multiple top 20 singles, and it's noted for including the band's 'signature song': the strident arena rock track \"Ain't Comin' Home\". The group created a music video featuring a straight performance of the song, emphasizing frontman Walt Lafty's aggressive style.\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\nMembers of the band experienced a surprisingly rapid rise to prominence, being signed a major record label when the musicians were still in their teens. They honed their particular sound by touring various nightclubs and other establishments in working-class areas of their native Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In terms of guitar work, Silvertide member Nick Perri took influence from the strident playing of Angus Young from the group AC/DC. That band also provided direct inspiration for other parts of the sound of Show and Tell. Some tracks call back to the glam metal movement, with the song \"California Rain\" explicitly mentioning in its lyrics the Sunset Strip area of Los Angeles.\nRecord producer Oliver Leiber shares multiple songwriting credits on the release. He had previously produced work by pop and rock n roll artists such as BBMak, Boomkat, The Corrs, The Knack, The Troys, and Youngstown in the 2000s. He started out as a member of the funk and soul group Ta Mara & the Seen in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Reviews and responses ==\nThe album was a commercial success, with three singles becoming top 20 rock hits on the charts done by Billboard magazine. Lead single \"Ain't Comin' Home\", which is also the first track on the album, has become known as Silvertide's 'signature song'. The group additionally created a music video featuring a straight performance of the track.\nMixed to positive reviews have come in from various publications such as Allmusic and PopMatters. Writing for the latter, music critic Michael Franco particularly praised the work of frontman Walt Lafty, remarking that the singer's \"voice is full of nasty blue-eyed soul, strutting and tearing and shuffling at will.\" He also stated that Lafty's \"phrasing also displays a cocksure aplomb mastered by only a few legends\" as the vocalist \"knows that delivering a lyric is as important as the actual words.\"\nRichie Unterberger, writing for Allmusic, argued that the release \"doesn't boast hooks on the order\" of the band's influences, labeling the album as \"unexceptional\". However, he stated as well that the group provided some positive variety, with several songs being on the slower side, and stated that Silvertide had the \"aggressive\" vibe of previous bands \"down cold\". While giving a mixed review, Unterberger additionally compared the vocals to that of Robert Plant, the frontman of band Led Zeppelin.\nSome retrospective commentary stated that the band seemed to have peaked too early, particularly given the teenage status of multiple band members. After the group's later break-up and reconciliation years later, Lafty and other members stated that they mostly agreed. However, they still felt as if the album captured their aggressive sound.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Ain't Comin' Home\" \u2013 4:04\n\"Devil's Daughter\" \u2013 3:51\n\"S.F.C.\" \u2013 4:04\n\"California Rain\" \u2013 3:52\n\"Blue Jeans\" \u2013 3:09\n\"Mary Jayne\" \u2013 3:53\n\"Heartstrong\" \u2013 4:17\n\"To See Where I Hide\" \u2013 3:54\n\"You Want It All\" \u2013 3:26\n\"Nothing Stays\" \u2013 5:00\n\"Foxhole J.C.\" \u2013 5:23\nB-sides\n\"Adult Child\",\n\"Beware\",\n\"Dragonfly\",\n\"Things are Gonna Change\"\n\"She Looked Away\"\n\n\n== Singles ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2004 in music\nKevin Shirley production discography\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Ain't Comin' Home\" - Official Music Video",

            "content": "The California Western Railroad (reporting mark CWR), popularly called the Skunk Train, is a heritage railroad in Mendocino County, California, running from the railroad's headquarters in the coastal town of Fort Bragg to the interchange with the Northwestern Pacific Railroad at Willits.\nThe CWR runs steam and diesel-powered trains and rail motor cars 40 miles (64 km) through Redwood forests along Pudding Creek and the Noyo River. Along the way, the tracks cross some 30 bridges and trestles and pass through two deep mountain tunnels. The halfway point of Northspur is a popular meals and beverage spot for the railroad's passengers when locomotives turn around before returning trains to their respective terminals.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe railroad was originally built by the Fort Bragg Redwood Company as the Fort Bragg Railroad in 1885 to carry coast redwood logs from the dense forests at Glenela (Glen Blair) to a newly built lumber mill located 6.6 miles (10.6 km) to the west at coastal Fort Bragg, California. Fort Bragg Redwood Company was incorporated into the new Union Lumber Company in 1904; the railroad ownership always rested with the parent lumber company until 1969. On July 1, 1905 the railroad was renamed the California Western Railroad & Navigation Company. In 1904 passenger service was added, and on December 11, 1911 the route was completed to its present length of 40 miles roughly following the Noyo River, to interchange connection with the Northwestern Pacific Railroad in the inland town of Willits, California. Construction up the Noyo River headwall required five horseshoe curves with a railway distance of 6.5 miles (10.5 km) to climb 932 feet (284 m) over the 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from Soda Springs to the summit. These curves were the site of a January, 1970, derailment which destroyed diesel locomotives 51, 52 and 54.\nThe rail connection to Fort Bragg was very popular for passengers traveling to and from San Francisco. Union Lumber Company selected premium grade clear redwood lumber (without knots) to build a Tyrolean Alps-style depot in 1916 where passengers changed trains at Willits. A Pullman car began operating between Fort Bragg and San Francisco in May, 1921; and this steam passenger train continued operating in addition to the Skunk railbus schedule until November, 1929.\n\nOn December 19, 1947 the railroad name was shortened to the California Western Railroad. Union Lumber and its California Western Railroad came under the ownership of the various lumber producers, including Boise Cascade (1969), and later Georgia-Pacific Corporation; G-P initially leased the CWR's operations to Kyle Railways, but in June 1987 the CWR was sold to the Kyle Railways subsidiary Mendocino Coast Railway. Mendocino Coast Railway continued to operate the CWR under the California Western name. No longer able to make a profit when the G-P mill began to reduce operations and finally closed altogether, Kyle Railways opted to sell the financially starved CWR. On December 17, 2003 the California Western Railroad was rescued when it was bought by the Sierra Railroad. Today the Skunk Train is owned and operated by Mendocino Railway.\n\n\n== Route ==\n\n\n== Freight traffic ==\nThe railroad owned 199 freight cars in 1912, including 156 flatcars for logs and lumber, six tank cars for locomotive fuel oil, three boxcars, a stock car, and some ballast cars. California Western leased steel freight cars from other railroads when these wooden cars became unsuitable for interchange service. The California Western Railroad was extended ten miles north from Fort Bragg along the Pacific coast to the Ten Mile River in 1916 and 1917; and logging branch lines operated up the Ten Mile River until the extension was dismantled in 1949. Most of the old wooden cars were scrapped when the extension was dismantled, but a few remained in use for maintenance of way service and to move lumber around the Fort Bragg sawmill yard. Much of the former railroad grade between Fort Bragg and the Ten Mile River is presently used as a MacKerricher State Park coastal trail; and an unused trestle is visible from California State Route 1 on the beach at the mouth of Pudding Creek.\nIn the late 1980s the railroad's freight redwood lumber traffic rapidly declined. Georgia-Pacific gradually shifted lumber shipments to more flexible highway trucks until the Northwestern Pacific Railroad [North Coast Railroad Authority] was embargoed and shut-down from Willits to the California Northern Railroad and Union Pacific mainline connection near the SF Bay Area. By 1996, before the NWP embargo, CWR lumber shipments were less than 500 cars per year and passenger service became the line's main source of revenue. All freight service was discontinued in 2001, and the Federal Railroad Administration's emergency order effectively cut the CWR off from the national rail network. Today the passenger excursion trains are the railroad's sole source of revenue. Freight traffic may restart in 2020, which is when the NWP is expected to be reopened to Willits. Occasionally, the CWR stores equipment on NWP trackage.\n\n\n== Skunk Train ==\n\nGas-powered, self-propelled, passenger railcars were added in 1925; and, after Pullman service was discontinued, CWR steam passenger trains ran only when the motorcars were out of service for maintenance. The passenger coaches were scrapped in 1949. The motorcars were nicknamed \"Skunks\" because people said \"You can smell 'em before you can see 'em.\" In 1965 the line reintroduced summer steam passenger service between Fort Bragg and Willits with \"Super Skunk\" Baldwin-built steam locomotive No.45 pulling four former Erie Lackawanna Railway 72-foot (22 m) Stillwell coaches built in 1926. That train was discontinued in 2001, then revived in September 2006. No.45 continues to power excursion trains from Fort Bragg, California as far as Northspur, California, the CWR's midpoint, on selected weekends summer to early autumn.\nWithout the considerable revenue lumber and general merchandise freight once contributed to the bottom line, maintaining the railway through such rugged terrain is a major undertaking, both logistically and financially, and service is not always available for the full trip from Fort Bragg to Willits, California. However, shorter trips to intermediate points usually run year-round.\nBetween April 11 and June 19, 2013, the railroad was in a crisis following the collapse of Tunnel #1 on April 11. The financially strapped railroad sought donations for $300,000 to hire an outside company to remove the blockage. Had the funding not been raised, the cash-starved railroad would have shut down. On June 19, a Redwood tree conservation group announced they would buy all of the Redwood trees along the 40-mile right-of-way, and would pay the railroad well more than their goal for the trees. The railroad resumed full service in August. Tunnel #1 was once again closed in 2016 after sustaining damage from the 2015-16 El Nino, but the railway was in a better position, having equipment at the Willits end of the line (which was not the case during the 2013 crisis) to allow the running of trains to Northspur; trains from the Fort Bragg end are limited to running on a seven-mile trip officially called the \"Pudding Creek Express\"; no announcements regarding the status of Tunnel #1 have been made recently, though they are fully committed to its reopening.\nThe railroad has also been featured in several movies, including The Signal Tower (1924), Racing with the Moon (1984), and The Majestic (2001).\n\n\n=== Curiosities ===\nPop Singer Michelle Lambert performed weekly shows on the Skunk Train during her teenage years.\n\n\n== Steam locomotives ==\n\n\n== Diesel locomotives ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of heritage railroads in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\nCWR & Union Lumber corporate records and ULCo/CWR history book manuscript being prepared by K.V.

            "content": "Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport (IATA: FLL, ICAO: KFLL, FAA LID: FLL) is in Broward County, Florida, United States, The airport is off Interstate 595, U.S. Route 1, Florida State Road A1A, and Florida State Road 5 bounded by the cities Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood and Dania Beach, three miles (5 km) southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale and 21 miles (34 km) north of Miami. The airport is near cruise line terminals at Port Everglades and is popular among tourists bound for the Caribbean. Since the late 1990s, FLL has become an intercontinental gateway, although Miami International Airport still handles most long-haul flights.\nIt is the largest base for Spirit Airlines, catering mainly to the airline's international to domestic network, and it is a focus city for JetBlue and Norwegian Long Haul. It is also a focus city for Allegiant Air and Southwest Airlines. In 2016, the top five air carriers by market share were JetBlue Airways at 25%, Southwest Airlines at 19.7%, Spirit Airlines at 19.4%, Delta Air Lines at 10.2%, and American Airlines at 6.9%. FLL is ranked as the 19th busiest airport (in terms of passenger traffic) in the United States, as well as the nation's 14th busiest international air gateway and one of the world's 50 busiest airports. FLL is classified by the US Federal Aviation Administration as a \"major hub\" facility serving commercial air traffic. In 2017 the airport processed 32,511,053 passengers (11.3% more than 2016) including 7,183,275 international passengers (18.6% more than 2016).\n\n\n== History ==\nMerle Fogg Airport opened on an abandoned 9-hole golf course on May 1, 1929. At the start of World War II, it was commissioned by the United States Navy and renamed Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale. The base was initially used for refitting civil airliners for military service before they were ferried across the Atlantic to Europe and North Africa. NAS Fort Lauderdale later became a main training base for Naval Aviators and enlisted naval air crewmen flying the Grumman TBF and TBM Avenger for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps aboard aircraft carriers and from expeditionary airfields ashore. NAS Fort Lauderdale was the home base for Flight 19, the five TBM Avengers that disappeared in December 1945, leading in part to the notoriety of the Bermuda Triangle.\nNAS Fort Lauderdale closed on October 1, 1946 and was transferred to county control, becoming Broward County International Airport.\nCommercial flights to Nassau began on June 2, 1953, and domestic flights began in 1958\u20131959: Northeast Airlines and National Airlines DC-6Bs flew nonstop to Idlewild, and Northeast flew nonstop to Washington National. In 1959 the airport opened its first permanent terminal building and assumed its current name.\nIn 1966, the airport averaged 48 airline operations a day; in 1972, it averaged 173 a day.\nThe Feb 1966 Official Airline Guide shows three nonstop departures to New York\u2013Kennedy and no other nonstop flights beyond Tampa and Orlando. Five years later. FLL had added nonstop flights to Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Minneapolis, New York\u2013La Guardia, Newark, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. (Northeast's nonstop to Los Angeles had already been dropped.)\nBy 1974, the airport was served by Braniff International Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, National Airlines, Northwest Orient Airlines, Shawnee Airlines and United Airlines. By 1979, following deregulation, Air Florida, Bahamasair, Florida Airlines, Mackey International Airlines, Republic Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Western Airlines also served the airport.\nLow-cost airline traffic grew in the 1990s, with Southwest opening its base in 1996, Spirit in 1999, and JetBlue in 2000. Spirit Airlines made FLL a hub in 2002. In 2003, JetBlue made FLL a focus city. US Airways also planned a hub at Fort Lauderdale in the mid-2000s as part of its reorganization strategy before its merger with America West.\nLow-cost competition forced several major legacy airlines to cut back service to FLL, with United pulling out of the airport entirely in 2008 and American Airlines moving its New York and Los Angeles services to West Palm Beach in 2013.\nDuring the 2005 hurricane season FLL was affected by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma. Katrina struck land in late August as a Category 1 and made landfall on Keating Beach just two miles from the airport (near the border of Broward and Miami\u2013Dade counties) with 80 mph (130 km/h) winds but caused only minor damage; however, the airport was closed for about a 48-hour period. However, when Hurricane Wilma made landfall in October roof damage was reported along with broken windows, damaged jetways, and destroyed canopies. The airport was closed for a period of 5 days. Hurricane Wilma was a Category 2 when its center passed to the west of FLL.\nIn February 2007, the airport started fees to all users, including private aircraft. FLL is one of the few airports to administer fees to private pilots. A minimum charge of $10 is assessed on landing private aircraft.\nOn October 11, 2016, Emirates announced that they would operate a flight from Dubai to Ft. Lauderdale daily using a Boeing 777-200LR. The airline decided on Fort Lauderdale instead of Miami, which has considerably longer runways and better facilities for long haul flights, because of its codeshare agreement with JetBlue. The airline started flying on December 2016. On October 27, 2016, British Airways announced a flight from London Gatwick to Ft. Lauderdale three times a week, which began on July 6, 2017.\nA shooting took place at the airport on January 6, 2017 in Terminal 2, claiming five lives and injuring six.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nFort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport covers 1,380 acres (558 ha) and has two runways:\n10L/28R: 9,000 x 150 ft (2,743 x 46 m) Asphalt\n10R/28L: 8,000 x 150 ft (2,438 x 46 m) Concrete (Opened September 18, 2014.)\nIn August 2017, there were 102 aircraft based at this airport: 6 single-engine, 17 multi-engine, 68 jet and 11 helicopter.\nSilver Airways has its headquarters in Suite 201 of the 1100 Lee Wagener Blvd building. When Chalk's International Airlines existed, its headquarters was on the grounds of the airport in an unincorporated area.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nExpansion of 10R/28L Runway\nIn 2003 plans to expand the facility started. Proposed improvements include an extension of runway 10R/28L, construction and modifications to the airport's taxiway system to provide for increased speed, improved inter-terminal passenger movement and extensive terminal upgrades. The plan was updated a second time in April 25, 2006. Complaints by nearby communities about noise, along with concerns about buyout requirements, delayed construction that is expected to keep Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport viable through 2020.\nOn June 5, 2007 Broward County commissioners voted six to three in favor of extending the southern 10R/28L runway. The proposal looks to extend the runway to 8,000 ft in order to accommodate larger aircraft and to allow airplanes to land side by side at the same time. The proposal was approved by the FAA and expansion of the south runway is now complete, with the opening of the runway in September 2014. The crosswind runway (13/31) was decommissioned on May 6, 2013. All four terminals, now having 57 gates, will have 97 with the completion of a new long-haul international Terminal Four and Concourse A at Terminal One. By 2020, Ft. Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood is projected to handle 36 million passengers annually.\nDemolition and Reconstruction of Terminal Four\nDuring and after the expansion of runway 10R/28L, reconstruction of Terminal Four will begin at the cost of $450 million. The H concourse will be demolished to build the new \"G\" concourse. In this process four new gates will be added. Concession space will be increased from 2,128 ft\u00b2 to 28,000 ft\u00b2 and a secure walkway will be added to connect terminals three and four.\n\n\n== Terminals ==\nFort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport has four terminals. Terminal 1, commonly referred to as \"The New Terminal,\" opened in stages between 2001 and 2003 and was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum and Cartaya Associates. The other three terminals were constructed in 1986 and designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills as part of a $263 million construction project. Terminal 4, commonly referred to as the International Terminal, was inaugurated by a Concorde visit in 1983. Since 2005, T4 has been undergoing renovations and a major expansion designed by PGAL/Zyscovich joint venture. The airport announced that Terminal 1, common known as \"The New Terminal\", will undergo $300 million makeover. Construction began in late 2015 and was completed in June 2017.\n\n\n=== Terminal 1 \"New Terminal\"\u2013 (yellow) ===\n\nTerminal 1 has three concourses (A, B, & C) and 24 gates. Concourse A opened on July 5, 2017 and has 7 gates (A1-A7), Concourse B has 7 gates (B2, B4-B9, B3 is now A1), and Concourse C has 9 gates (C1-C9). Concourse A mainly serves international travelers.\nUnited Airlines operates a United Club in Concourse C, which opened with the new Terminal in May 2001 as a Continental Airlines Presidents Club.\nThis Terminal is used by Southwest, Alaska, Allegiant, Silver, Bahamasair, Sun Country (Charter), United, JetBlue (Cancun and Cuba Arrivals), Virgin America, and WestJet.\n\n\n=== Terminal 2 \u2013 \"Delta\" Terminal (red) ===\n\nTerminal 2 has one concourse (D) and 9 gates.\nDelta Air Lines operates a Sky Club here \u2013 one of six clubrooms in the state of Florida.\nThis Terminal is used by Delta, Delta Connection, Air Canada, and Air Canada Rouge.\n\n\n=== Terminal 3 \u2013 Main Terminal (purple) ===\n\nTerminal 3 has two concourses (E & F) and 20 gates.\nIn May 2013 a food court opened in Concourse F. It currently consists a Pei Wei, Einstein Bros. Bagels, and a Steak 'n Shake.\nThis Terminal is used by Azul (Departures), American, American Eagle, Norwegian, JetBlue, Spirit, Air Transat and Sunwing.\n\n\n=== Terminal 4 \u2013 International Terminal (green) ===\nTerminal 4 has one concourse (G) and 11 gates (G1-G6, G10-G14). Concourse H was closed in December 2017 and will be demolished in early 2018.\n\nNote: Terminal 4 handles all non-precleared international arrivals, in addition to the departures listed in the table.\nConcourse H is currently being reconfigured and designed by the architectural firms of PGAL/Zyscovich joint venture. The new three-story facility renamed Concourse G will have 14 new gates, 11 of which are international/domestic capable and one arrivals area for bussing operations. New concessions and approximately 50,000 s.f. of administrative offices for the Aviation Department are being designed on the upper levels of the facility. Western Expansion began construction in 2013. Currently, gates G1-G6 on the east end and G10-G14 on the west end are operational and in use. Eastern expansion opened its first phase in December 2017. An expanded Federal Inspection Services facility will also included in the new Eastern Expansion construction.\nThis Terminal is used by Air Transat, Avianca, British Airways, Caribbean, Copa, Emirates, Spirit, Sunwing, TAME, American (International Arrivals), Azul (Arrivals), Norwegian, JetBlue (International Arrivals), Silver (International Arrivals), IBC Airways, and SkyBahamas.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Top destinations ===\n\n\n=== Annual traffic ===\n\n\n=== Airline Market Share ===\n\n\n=== GA overcrowding reliever facility ===\nSee Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport\n\n\n== Art Exhibit ==\nInternationally known artist and sculptor Duane Hanson created an installation for his work \"Vendor with walkman\" at the Departure Level of Terminal 3 at the airport. Hamson who retired and died in nearby Boca Raton created a seated middled age man wearing a red T-shirt, blue pants, baseball cap and listening to a walkman during a break. The installation accessories give additional clues to the narrative of the artwork: toy airplane, various signs and announcement for the shop, janitorial supplies.\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\nFLL is served by Broward County Transit bus Route 1 which offers connecting service through the Central Terminal in Downtown Fort Lauderdale, and also service to Aventura, in Miami-Dade County.\nRail service between Miami and West Palm Beach is provided by Tri-Rail commuter rail service at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport station, accessible via a free Tri-Rail shuttle from the main terminals. The shuttle stops at 3 locations at the airport, all on the lower level: west end of terminal 1, between terminals 2 and 3, and between terminals 3 and 4. The shuttle operates 7 days a week.\nThe airport also offers airport parking and operates a consolidated rental car facility which can be accessed from Terminal 1 by a short walk and from the other terminals by a free shuttle bus service.\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn May 18, 1972, an Eastern Air Lines McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31 had its landing gear collapse and tail section separate during landing. The aircraft then caught fire but all passengers and crew were able to safely evacuate.\nOn July 7, 1983, Air Florida Flight 8 with 47 people on board was flying from Fort Lauderdale International Airport to Tampa International Airport. One of the passengers handed a note to one of the flight attendants, saying that he had a bomb, and telling them to fly the plane to Havana, Cuba. He revealed a small athletic bag, which he opened, and inside was an apparent explosive device. The airplane was diverted to Havana-Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed International Airport, and the hijacker was taken into custody by Cuban authorities.\nOn November 19, 2013, an Air Evac International Learjet 35 crashed shortly after take-off from the airport, on its way to Cozumel, Mexico, after calling mayday and during an attempt to return to the airport, possibly due to engine failure, leaving 4 persons dead.\nOn October 29, 2015, Dynamic Airways Flight 405, a Boeing 767-246ER (N251MY) was taxiing to a runway to take off for a flight to Caracas, Venezuela. when its left engine caught fire due to a fuel leak. The crew immediately stopped the airplane and fire crews arrived on the scene. All 101 passengers and crew were evacuated the aircraft, and 17 passengers were transported to a hospital. All runways were shut down and air operations ceased at the airport for three hours.\nOn October 28, 2016, Fedex Express Flight 910, a McDonnell Douglas MD-10-10F cargo aircraft (N370FE) arriving from Memphis, Tennessee, caught fire after its left landing gear collapsed upon landing. The fire destroyed its left engine and wing. The three-person crew evacuated the aircraft safely.\nOn January 6, 2017, a mass shooting occurred in the baggage claim area of Terminal 2 of the airport. Five people were killed, six others were injured. The shooter was taken into custody without incident and was identified by authorities as Esteban Santiago-Ruiz. Santiago acted alone.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Fort Lauderdale \u2013 Hollywood International Airport at Wikimedia Commons\nFort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport (official site)\n\"Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport\".  brochure from CFASPP\nNaval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Museum (History of Ft.

These compounds are polyene dicarboxylic acids that include both lipophilic and polar amino acids. They were extracted from the brightly colored mushrooms Boletus laetissimus and B. rufoaureus. The boletocrocins' conjugated systems account for the intense color.\nRelated biological pigments are present in other fungi, such as calostomal (from Calostoma cinnabarinum), melanocrocin (from Melanogaster broomeianus), and mycenaaruin A (from Mycena aurantiomarginata).\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "\"Baby It's You\" is a song written by Burt Bacharach (music), Luther Dixon (credited as Barney Williams) and Mack David (lyrics). It was recorded by the Shirelles and the Beatles, and became hits for both. The highest-charting version of \"Baby It's You\" was by the band Smith, who took the song to number five on the US charts in 1969.\n\n\n== The Shirelles' original version ==\nThe song was produced by Luther Dixon. When released as a single in 1961, the song became very popular, becoming a Top 10 smash on the Pop and R&B Charts, reaching number three on the R&B chart and peaking at number eight on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. It later appeared on the album Baby It's You, named to capitalize upon the success of the single. The vocal arrangements on this version proved influential in subsequent versions, including that by the Beatles, who used the same one. One notable feature of the song is its minor-to-major key chord changes on the verses.\n\n\n== The Beatles version ==\nEnglish rock group the Beatles performed \"Baby It's You\" as part of their stage act from 1961 until 1963, and recorded it on February 11, 1963 for their first album, Please Please Me, along with \"Boys\", another song by the Shirelles. American label Vee-Jay Records included it on Introducing... The Beatles and Songs, Pictures and Stories of the Fabulous Beatles. Capitol included it on The Early Beatles. The Beatles' version differs to the Shirelles' by repeating the second verse instead of the first. So, where the Shirelles conclude with a line about sitting home and crying, the Beatles's conclusion is more upbeat, John Lennon singing that he will carry on loving, no matter what.\nA live version was released on Live at the BBC in 1994. On this version, Lennon does not repeat part of the second verse after the solo (as he did on the studio version), but repeats part of the first verse, which is the way the Shirelles sang the song. The song was issued as a CD single and a vinyl single in 1995 in both the UK and the US, the Beatles' first in nearly a decade. Both versions have four tracks, making it an EP instead of a regular issue single. The three additional tracks, while from BBC recordings, did not appear on Live at the BBC. Tracks 2 and 4 were later included on On Air \u2013 Live at the BBC Volume 2, but this recording of track 3 remains unique to this release. The single reached number seven in the UK and number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n1995 release track listing\n\"Baby It's You\" (Bacharach/David/Williams) \u2013 2:45\n\"I'll Follow the Sun\" (Lennon\u2013McCartney) \u2013 1:51\n\"Devil in Her Heart\" (Drapkin) \u2013 2:23\n\"Boys\" (Dixon/Farrell) \u2013 2:29\nThe version of Baby It's You on this release is notable for having a definite ending as opposed to a fade out on the original album version.\n\n\n=== Music video ===\nA live music video was released in 1994 to promote the single. It consisted of a combination of the Beatles dancing and still photographs, and was later included on a DVD or Blu-ray that comes with the 2015 release 1+.\n\n\n=== Personnel ===\nJohn Lennon \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar\nPaul McCartney \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals\nRingo Starr \u2013 drums\nGeorge Martin \u2013 celesta\nNorman Smith \u2013 engineer\n\n\n=== Charts ===\n\n\n== Smith version ==\nSmith's version appeared on their debut album, A Group Called Smith. The single was released on Dunhill 4206 in 1969. It was their first and most successful release. This version alters the traditional vocal arrangement as performed by the Shirelles and the Beatles in favor of a more belted, soulful vocal. The single hit #5 on the Billboard Hot 100. The Smith version was used in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof.\n\n\n== The Carpenters version ==\nThe Carpenters recorded a version of \"Baby It's You\" in 1970 for their album Close to You. Although it wasn't released as a single, it was performed on their TV series, Make Your Own Kind of Music in 1971. It was also featured on the UK compilation, Reflections in 1998 with a special remix done by Richard Carpenter in 1991.\n\n\n== Silk version ==\n\"Baby It's You\" is an R&B song by Atlanta-based vocal quintet Silk. It charted at #44 on the UK Singles Chart in 1993.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\nA number of other well-known artists have recorded covers of the song, among them:\nBruce Channel, 1962\nSylvie Vartan (in French), 1962\nDave Berry, 1964\nCilla Black, 1965\nCliff Richard, 1967 & 2002\nSmith (band), 1969\nThe Masqueraders, 1975\nThe Sunset Bombers, 1978\nLoleatta Holloway, 1979\nDolly Mixture, 1980\nEmily Bindiger, 1981\nSonny Vincent and the Extreme, 1982\nPia Zadora, 1982\nGrey-Star, 1983\nElvis Costello & Nick Lowe, 1984\nStacy Lattisaw & Johnny Gill, 1984\nMai Yamane, 1985\nAce Frehley, 1988\nJohnny Thunders & Patti Palladin, 1988\nCherrelle, 1992\nPetty Booka, 1995\nChrissie Hynde, 1998\nLeigh Stephens, 2004\nAlyson Stoner, 2005\nThe Bonedrivers, 2006\nShakin' Stevens, 2007\nAdele Adkins, 2008\nFriendly Fires, 2009\nShakespears Sister, 2010\nHaley Reinhart, 2011 & 2017\nAnna Calvi, 2011\nKramer, 2012\nBette Midler, 2014\nMapei, 2014\nThe Last Internationale, 2014\nAmber Riley, 2014.

            "content": "106 BOB fm is a radio station broadcasting to 106.7 MHz and 106.9 MHz on FM in Knebworth, Hertford, Ware, Hatfield, Stevenage, Hitchin, Letchworth Garden City, Welwyn Garden City, Watton-at-Stone in the United Kingdom and to the Home Counties on DAB digital radio broadcasting on Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire multiplex and streaming at www.bobfm.co.uk. Programming originates from studios at the Old Pump House in Knebworth Park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early Years : Radio Hertford and HertBeat ===\nIn October 1998, following seven years of lobbying of the Radio Authority Radio Hertford was granted a Restricted Service Licence to broadcast for a two-week period to Hertford and surrounding areas.\nIn 1999 the Radio Authority invited applications to apply for a long-term Hertford licence. The Radio Hertford consortium submitted a bid to broadcast as Hertbeat FM  competing with a rival entrant, Stag FM, backed by The Daily Mail Radio Group. Citing Radio Hertford's lobbying of the Radio Authority, trial broadcast and emphasis on local content, the HertBeat FM bid was awarded licence in February 2000: \"an imaginative, music-led service, targeted at discerning 25 to 54 year olds, with intelligent speech that emphasises local news and information.\" \n\nFollowing the award, the Old Pump House at Knebworth Park was converted into a radio studio. Broadcasting commenced on 3 March 2001 with the inaugural show presented by Robbie Owen, a director of the company. Amongst the original team was Steve Folland, who continued presenting at the station until November 2013.\nJuly 2005 saw HertBeat FM acquired by Shadow Radio Holdings Ltd., led by Brett Harley, resulting in a change of directors.\nThe station continued its offering of locally oriented content, music and request shows using a roster of presenters through the day and night.\n\n\n== Jack FM ==\nOn 10 May 2010, accompanied by a cull of presenters, the station abruptly rebranded as Jack FM - the third such licensee operating in the UK. Amongst the reasons for terminating HertBeat was confusion with encroaching rival Heart.\nThe Jack format was mostly automated, initially only \"Jack's Breakfast\" with Steve Folland surviving as a presenter-led show but quickly complimented with a Saturday \"Interactive Brunch\" topical news show presented by Chris Hubbard and a Sunday \"All Eighties\" music show with Brett Harley. The rest of the schedule included music, snippets from Jack's Breakfast, News and other local content.\nIn common with the other UK Jack stations many links between segments were provided by the acerbic Voice of Jack, Paul Darrow, recorded at Jack FM Oxfordshire and often tailored for the local audience. Unlike HertBeat, Jack FM rejected listener's requests, a stance supported by the brand slogan, \"Playing what we want\" and Voice of Jack remarks.\n\nIn November 2013, as the Jack FM era drew to a close Steve Folland departed the station, replaced by experienced producer and presenter Graham Mack.\n\n\n== BOB fm ==\nThe station prepared to broadcast using DAB in addition to FM, triggering another rebranding due to lack of exclusivity of the Jack FM moniker on the DAB multiplex and potential clashes with the growing number of stations operating as Jack FM franchises.\nFrom January to March 2014 listeners were encouraged to suggest new names for the station. Unlike the sudden transformation to Jack FM, the plan to rename the station was trailed extensively.\nThe rebranding was announced on 10 March 2014. The final song played by the station as Jack FM Hertfordshire was \"Things Can Only Get Better\" by D:Ream, airing shortly before 0800.\nAt 0808 the station was transformed into BOB fm: The inaugural song was \"Hit the Road Jack\" by Ray Charles.\nBOB fm's links are provided by the Voice of BOB.\nAlthough other Bob FM stations operate in USA and Canada and BOB fm Hertfordshire has utilized an existing catchphrase, \"Turn your knob to BOB\", the operations are unconnected and the Hertfordshire-based station remains independent.\n\n\n== Notable former presenters and personalities ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External ==\nExcerpt of CNN interview with Brett Harley, Hertbeat FM - YouTube\nBOB fm website - \"You'll hear all sorts of stuff\"",
