At the 2016 Summer Olympics he competed in the Men's foil and earned a silver medal; he also earned a bronze medal in Men's team foil.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMassialas was born in San Francisco, California to a father of Greek descent and a Taiwanese mother. His father, Greg Massialas, fenced for the United States in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics, and currently coaches the American national foil team. His sister, Sabrina, is also a high-level foil fencer. Despite this, Massialas was never pushed into fencing. After he showed spontaneous interest at an early age, his father made him wait until he was seven years old to begin training.\nAn athletic child, Massialas also played soccer, and made the basketball and the swimming teams at Drew School. He enrolled Stanford University on a fencing scholarship in the fall of 2012. He closed his freshman season by winning the 2013 NCAA title in individual men's foil. He repeated this feat in 2015, after falling to David Willette in 2014's semifinal round.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Death Jr. is a video game for the PlayStation Portable. The PSP iteration was the first PSP game shown publicly and advertised as a killer-app. It was released to a mixed reception and noted for numerous problems about the camera, gameplay and uninspiring graphics, but was praised for its Tim Burton-esque themes and quirky characters. Slightly better received was the comic book adaptation by Gary Whitta and Ted Naifeh, which includes two three-issue miniseries.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game, movie, and comic book are about the teenage son of the Grim Reaper, named Death Jr. (DJ for short). His father tried many times (all of them failed) to stop his son from creating chaos at every school he has been in. Now is DJ's last chance. If he creates chaos one more time, he'll be sent to military school. He meets new friends at this school: Pandora, a girl with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and a thing for locked boxes; Stigmartha, a girl who has holes in her hands and bleeds from them whenever she's nervous; Smith and Weston, conjoined twins who are very smart and conjoined at the head; the Seep, an armless, legless, foul-mouthed kid in a vat; and the Dead Guppy, a character who speaks for himself.\nThe friends go on a field trip to a museum, where they find a locked box that Pandora wants opened, so DJ opens it to impress her. Unfortunately, all hell breaks loose and demons run amok. It's up to DJ to stop them, revert the town back to normal, all the while making sure Dad doesn't find out.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn the game, the player has a variety of guns ranging from pistols to a rocket launcher. The controls are simple. The player moves around with the analog nub and attacks people with the square and circle buttons. There is a lot of emphasis in the game on the combos which can be achieved by linking attacks to each other in rapid succession.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game received average or mixed reviews, as GameRankings gave it a score of 63.30% while Metacritic gave it a score of 61 out of 100.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeath, Jr. and the Science Fair of Doom\nDeath Jr. II: Root of Evil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDeath Jr. at MobyGames",

Introduced in 2007, it is named after the unit of illuminance, \"lux\", which is Latin for \"light\". The objective of the LUX Prize is to illuminate the public debate on European integration and to facilitate the diffusion of European films in the European Union.\n\n\n== Selection criteria ==\nFilms to be selected have to meet following criteria:\nFiction or documentary films (may be animated)\nMinimum length of 60 minutes\nProduced or co-produced in a European Union country or in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland\nIllustrates the universality of European values and the diversity of European culture, bringing insights into the debate on the process of building Europe\nReleased for the first time between May 1 of the previous year and June 1 of the current year.\n\n\n== Selection panel ==\nFor the first edition of the prize, three films were shortlisted by a 17-member panel composed mainly of people working in the cinematic professions who were appointed by the European Parliament's Culture and Education Committee. Each film is shown nine times within the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, in a 90-seat cinema room specially conceived and built for this purpose.\nPanel members were:\nMr Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00c1RON\nCritics\nMr Paulo BRANCO\nProducer and distributor, Atalanta Filmes. Director, Estoril Film Festival\nMrs Marion DORING\nDeputy Director, European Film Academy\nMrs Kirsten Lykke DALGAARD\nExhibitor and distributor.

Voting takes place electronically via the intranet site at the Parliament. The film which gains the highest number of votes is the winner.\nThe producers of the ten shortlisted films are required to provide digital copies in the form of DVDs, Vimeo link, or OpenDCP for the members of the European Parliament. In 2015, the shortlisted Son of Saul was disqualified when the production team refused to provide this fearing from these copies being pirated.\n\n\n== The prize ==\nThe LUX Prize consists of assistance in kind in the form of subtitling and video-to-film transfer (kinescopage) of the winning film in the 23 official EU languages (including the film's original language, for the deaf and hard of hearing).\nIn the case that the winning film has already been sold for projection in cinemas in some countries and subtitled for the purpose, the nature of the prize (e.g. assistance with production of the DVD) will be determined by agreement between the European Parliament and the film's appointed representatives.\nThe trophy forming the LUX Prize's visual identity is created by the Belgian artist Jocelyne Coster and inspired by a representation of the Tower of Babel, the symbol also used by the European Parliament to indicate multilingualism and cultural diversity united in a single place and with a single goal. The trophy is presented in the plenary in Strasbourg, France to the laureate by the Parliament President in front of the MEPs, and representatives from the other films in competition.\n\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nEuropean Border Breakers Award\nEuropean Film Awards\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nSpotlight on European film (Feature on European Parliament's website)\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Blackadder was a clipper ship, a sister ship to Hallowe'en, built in 1870 by Maudslay, Sons & Field at Greenwich for Jock Willis & Sons.\nBlackadder was dismasted on her maiden voyage due to failures in the mast fittings and rigging. She \"was able to reach the Cape under jury rig 63 days out.\" John Willis took legal action against the builders which dragged on to such an extent that her sister ship, Hallowe'en, was not handed over to Willis until nearly 18 months after her launch. After John Willis died in 1900, Blackadder was bought by J. Aalborg of Krager\u00f8 in Norway. On 5 November 1905 she was wrecked whilst on passage from Barry to Bahia loaded with coal.\n\n\n== History ==\nJock Willis & Sons operated a shipping line which specialised in fast sailing cargo ships, including tea clippers trading tea from China. These were 'state of the art' ships designed to take part in what had become a race to be the fastest ship home with the new season tea. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 together with steady improvements in steam engineering meant that sailing ships were slowly being replaced by steam ships, which could operate on guaranteed timetables and make use of the shorter route through the canal, which was unsuitable for sailing ships. However, steamers had the disadvantage of having to purchase coal for the journey and to carry coal, reducing the space available for cargo. A number of ship owners therefore still believed there was a place for good sailing ships, and these continued in profitable service for many years.\nIn 1869 Jock Willis, junior (son of Jock Willis, senior, founder of the company) had commissioned another clipper, Cutty Sark, which was a composite design (timber hull on iron frame). He now commissioned two further ships, but this time with iron hulls. As was the case with Cutty Sark, the shape of the hull for the ships was based upon another ship belonging to Willis, The Tweed (previously named Punjaub). This was a former sail/paddle steamer frigate built in Bombay for the East India Company, later sold when the East India company navy was merged into the Royal Navy. Willis removed the engines and paddle wheels and found he had an exceptionally good sailing ship. Messrs. Ritherdon and Thompson, the surveyors to the East India Council, were commissioned to prepare drawings for the new ships based upon The Tweed. Although similar below the water and of very similar size, the two ships looked somewhat different from Cutty Sark.\nMaudsley and Co. were contracted to construct the ship, although they were an engineering company relatively inexperienced with whole ship design. This was not dissimilar to Willis' choice in builders for Cutty Sark which was also a new and inexperienced company, which in that instance became bankrupt before Cutty Sark was completed. The contract was signed in June 1869 and the ship launched March 1870, to the highest Lloyds standards and using the best materials.\n\n\n=== Maiden Voyage ===\nCargo was starting to be loaded on board the ship even before installation of the masts had been completed. Masts on such a ship are sectional and are installed in overlapping pieces with stays (lines) running up from the deck to fixing points on each section to hold the masts steady. It was noticed that the stays were slack, so they were re-tightened, only for them to be found slack again the following day. On further examination it was discovered that the metal cradles which supported the topmasts had been incorrectly manufactured, and had simply bent out of shape once tension had been applied on the stays. Rather than remove the masts to repair the damage, additional strengthening was added to hold together the cradles and provide new fixing points. However, the bent ironwork could not be repaired with the masts in place. The ship sailed for China.\nDuring the journey it became clear that repairs had been inadequate. Chains were aded to the mainmast to help support its topmast, and it was noticed that rivets holding the collar around the mainmast were becoming loose. The ship's carpenter proposed drilling through the mast and inserting a winch handle to ensure the collar stayed in place, but the captain refused. Only the skysail yards were taken down to reduce loading on the masts.\nAt about midnight, with the wind slackening and changing direction and approaching the Roaring Forties, the captain decided to trim the ship and ordered a change in helm. Despite care by the helmsan to carry out the turn as slowly as possible so as to minimise the stress on the masts as the pressure from the winds changed, the inevitable rolling of the ship as it ceased to be pushed along while turning caused the collar to break away and the lower rigging with it. The continuing rolling meant the masts leaned one way and then the other, each time becoming looser. The iron mainmast buckled below the level of the deck, tearing the deck as it did, ending leaning to port at 45 degrees. Shortly the remaining supports gave way and with an extra large roll, the mast tore further through the deck and fell overboard.\nBraces to the mizzen mast from the main had been torn away, and it too started to rock loose. Despite attempts to get a line on it, while also trying to clear lines still attached to the sinking mainmast, this mast too fell, this time backwards across the stern of the ship, just missing the wheel. Crew worked to get the mizzen free and overboard, as it rolled dangerously about on the deck. The sole remaining mast was now unsupported because its braces from the mainmast had also gone, but in this case the crew managed to get lines tightened to hold it in place. Both fore topsail yards had been snapped as the falling main mast pulled on them, and the other yards were pulled out of place.\nThe following morning two men went aloft on the still swaying foremast to try to clear the broken rigging and yards. The royal yard came loose and fell, bringing with it part of the fore topgallant mast. Over the next three days the crew managed to salvage enough yards to have three sails on the foremast plus stunsails and set course for Simon's Bay. Another ship, the St. Mungo saw the state of Blackadder and tried to come to assist, but was unable to catch up. Approaching False Bay to anchor, the ship fouled a wreck and before repairs were completed was in collision with two other vessels. Replacement masts and yards were sent out from Britain and the ship eventually proceeded to Shanghai. On the way she collided with a French mail steamer, and after further repairs lost her jibboon in yet another collision at Penang. She returned to London, arriving 17 November 1871 without further notable incident. The ships insurers refused to pay out on claims for the damage, on the grounds the ship had been unseaworthy when it set out, and eighteen months of litigation against the builders ensued.\n\n\n=== Calmer sailing ===\nThe ship's captain was dismissed and replaced with Captain Moore. The following season's journey to China was relatively uneventful, only involving the loss of the mizzen topgallant mast in a collision. Moore was moved to command Cutty Sark and replaced with Sam Bissett, who had been mate on the maiden voyage. Carrying coal from Sydney to Shanghai she was caught in a typhoon, which caused the ship to heel over so much that the main and mizzen masts had to be cut away once more to right her. The cargo had shifted and had to be moved before the ship could be properly righted, but she limped on to Shanghai where new masts were fitted and she proceeded to Iloio and loaded a cargo for Boston. In the China sea the ship hit an uncharted reef and stuck fast, despite throwing the cargo overboard. the ship was abandoned and the crew taken off by Albyn's isle, which had come to their assistance. A squall sprang up, which now blew the ship clear of the reef and after a chase of some hours the crew managed to reboard the ship and take control of their vessel again. A slow journey to Boston followed. For the fourth season she was commanded by Captain White.\n\n\n== References ==\nLubbock, Basil (1914). The China Clippers.

            "content": "Ruby Flipper were a multiracial, mixed-sex dance troupe who performed dance routines to songs in the UK Singles Chart on the BBC television series Top of the Pops in 1976.\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe original Ruby Flipper line-up consisted of four female dancers and three male dancers:\nLulu Cartwright\nCherry Gillespie\nPhillip Haigh (sometimes credited as Phillip Steggles)\nPatti Hammond\nSue Menhenick\nFloyd Pearce\nGavin Trace\nThe troupe made their TOTP debut on 6 May 1976, performing a dance routine to The Stylistics' version of \"Can't Help Falling In Love\".\n\n\n== Origins ==\nAs a replacement for Pan's People, choreographer Flick Colby decided to put together a new troupe which would feature both male and female dancers. In a BBC interview, co-manager Ruth Pearson added, \"Pan's People had been around for about eight years and it felt like it was time for a concept change.\"\nAuditions for the troupe took place at the Dance Centre in London's Covent Garden following press advertisements. The final line-up was chosen in March 1976 and began a period of rehearsal before their first appearance on Top of the Pops.\nColby and Pearson chose the name \"Ruby Flipper\" for the new team, a supposed combination of their personal names (RUBY FLIPPER = RUth PEaRson + FLIck colBY +P). Former Pan's People members, Cherry Gillespie and Sue Menhenick, were invited to join the new TOTP dance troupe.\n\n\n== Demise ==\nHowever, the troupe were not retained as the resident dancers on Top of the Pops for long. Haigh recalled, \"They didn't really give a clear reason why, but they just said that it had been decided that 'Ruby Flipper will be coming to an end and that they'd be looking for a new group'.\"\nAccording to Colby, Bill Cotton advised her and Pearson to disband Ruby Flipper in favour of a new all-girl company: \"...He said he didn't like the concept and that he wanted a girl group back on the show. I was told to reform an all-girl group - or quit.\"\nChanges to the line-up of Ruby Flipper occurred during their time on Top of the Pops. Trace last appeared as part of the line-up on 15 July 1976; his final routine being Tavares' Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel. Gillespie also left the troupe in September 1976; her last performance was The Ritchie Family's \"The Best Disco in Town\" on 30 September 1976.\nBy the autumn of 1976, Colby and Pearson decided to disband Ruby Flipper and return to the all-female dance troupe formula of Pan's People with a new sextet, Legs & Co.. Ruby Flipper made their final Top of the Pops appearance on 14 October 1976 as a quintet, with a routine to Wild Cherry's \"Play That Funky Music\".\n\n\n== Life after TOTP ==\nThe two male dancers in the final line-up, Haigh and Pearce, continued their dancing careers.\nPearce was invited back to dance on TOTP for at least nine routines with Legs & Co. in the next two years, in routines to:\nStevie Wonder's \"I Wish\" on 23 December 1976\nAndrew Gold's \"Lonely Boy\" on 14 April 1977\nBo Kirkland and Ruth Davis' \"You're Gonna Get Next To Me\" on 16 June 1977\nDonna Summer's \"I Feel Love\" on 11 August 1977,\nStevie Wonder's \"Sir Duke\" on 25 December 1977\nJohn Travolta and Olivia Newton-John's \"You're the One That I Want\" on 25 May 1978\nThe Real Thing's \"Let's Go Disco\" also on 25 May 1978\nSylvester's \"(You Make Me Feel) Mighty Real\" on 21 September 1978\nJohn Travolta and Olivia Newton-John's \"Summer Nights\" on 25 December 1978.\nPearce also appeared along with Legs and Co for two dance numbers dancing to The Real Thing's \"Let's Go Disco\" and Odyssey's \"Native New Yorker\" in the film \"The Stud\" in 1978, as well as dancing with Legs and Co to The Bee Gees' \"Night Fever\" on Larry Grayson's Generation Game and as a dancer in the Dougie Squires troupe that backed the singer Lulu in her segments of The Les Dawson Show that same year. He joined the dance troupe Hot Gossip and from July 1978 could be seen in their routines that featured on Kenny Everett's shows (in series one, three and four on ITV and series 6 on the BBC) He stayed with Hot Gossip until they disbanded at the end of 1986, occasionally singing lead vocals to songs in stage shows and videos, as well as dancing. In 1980 he danced with Hot Gossip in the Village People's film Can't Stop The Music' and also had a small part dancing in the Monty Python Film 'The Meaning of Life'. He also sang with a variety of celebrities and minor celebrities on the charity single Doctor in Distress in 1985, a song which campaigned to have the Doctor Who series returned to television, as it was on hiatus at that point.\nUntil 1981 and the introduction of Zoo, the resident TOTP dance troupe would remain exclusively female. The three remaining female dancers; Cartwright, Hammond and Menhenick; became part of the line-up for Legs & Co., who made their debut the week after Ruby Flipper's last performance and remained as part of the resident TOTP dance troupe until October 1981.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSimpson, J., (2002), Top of the Pops: 1964-2002, London, BBC Worldwide\n\n\n== External links ==\nBBC TOTP Ruby Flipper page\nRuby Flipper History, Routines, Interviews\nOne for the Dads: Digging the dancing queens of TV pop: Pan's People, Legs and Co, Ruby Flipper and others",

He pursued university studies as an actor and, in 1981, presented as his graduation thesis a comedic monologue \"el Conde del Gu\u00e1charo.\" The \"Conde\" or Count became a TV personality and made Rausseo one of Venezuela's most successful stand-up comedians. Beyond comedy he was also a dare-devil and stunt performer in the television variety show Sabado Sensacional. In 2006 Rausseo was studying law and was one semester from graduating with a JD from the Universidad Santa Mar\u00eda de Caracas. Rausseo owns a theme park in Isla Margarita called Musip\u00e1n.\n\n\n== Presidential aspirations ==\nIn July 2006, he announced that he was running for president under his newly formed \"Piedra Party,\" as a protest against the state of politics in Venezuela, and to challenge the presidency of Hugo Chavez.\nThree weeks before the election, in accordance with a campaign pledge he had made earlier (to stand down if not placed first or second in the opinion polls), he withdrew his candidacy without endorsing either Ch\u00e1vez or Rosales, telling his supporters to vote for either.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMusipan Theme Park Official Site",

            "content": "A Chinese finger trap (also known as a Chinese finger puzzle, Chinese thumb cuff, Chinese handcuffs and similar variants) is a gag toy used to play a practical joke on unsuspecting children and adults. The finger trap is a simple puzzle that traps the victim's fingers (often the index fingers) in both ends of a small cylinder woven from bamboo. The victim of the joke must push their finger farther inside the trap for it to loosen. The single ended version sold as a \"girlfriend trap\" has been available since at least 1870 when it was recorded as a \u2033M\u00e4dchenf\u00e4nger\" or \"girl catcher\".\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe initial reaction of the victim is to pull their fingers outward, but this only tightens the trap. The way to escape the trap is to push the ends toward the middle, which enlarges the openings and frees the fingers.\nThe tightening is simply a normal behavior of a cylindrical, helically wound braid, usually the common biaxial braid. Pulling the entire braid lengthens and narrows it. The length is gained by reducing the angle between the warp and weft threads at their crossing points, but this reduces the radial distance between opposing sides and hence the overall circumference. The more one pulls, the more the circumference shrinks and the trap tightens. The same effect is used in specialized textile manufacturing, the Vivien Kellems cable grip, Indonesian woven fruit presses, and by fly-fishers.\nChinese finger traps are not intended for use as restraint devices. Strong victims of the prank may break the bamboo strips when they pull outwards, attempting to free their fingers and stretching the trap beyond its limits.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nOne variation on the Chinese finger trap has uses in orthopedic medicine\u2014namely, providing even pressure to the patient's digit(s) and at the same time immobilizing the joints\u2014and serves a similar purpose as a traction device. Its development goes back to Austria in 1870 when Dr. Steinberger, a dentist at the Rudolfsspital in Vienna, reported the discovery of his doctoral Student Schmall, who got the idea to use the toy \u2033M\u00e4dchenf\u00e4nger\" (girl catcher) for the extension of fingers and arms. The principle was adapted for the use in surgery, and already in 1873 termed \"Schmall'sches Extensionsgeflecht\".\nAnother variant is the towing sock. It uses the same principle to seize the end of a cable to be pulled through a tube or tunnel.\n\n\n== Cultural influence ==\nThe Chinese finger trap is also a common metaphor for a problem that can be overcome by relaxing, i.e. not trying too hard to solve it; for example, in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The gag has been used in a number of films and television productions, such as the Stan Laurel short Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde (1925), the Our Gang short Moan and Groan, Inc. (1929), the \"This Little Wiggy\" episode of the American show The Simpsons in 1998, the Dexter's Laboratory episode \"Unfortunate Cookie\", the Milo Murphy's Law episode \"Murphy's Lard\", The Addams Family in 1991, the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"The Last Outpost\", in which Lt. Commander Data is stumped by the device, and the Bob's Burgers episode \"Midday Run\". The trap was also featured in the book series The Heroes of Olympus, most notably The Mark of Athena, the joke a source of humor and a solution in the climax.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Chinese finger traps at Wikimedia Commons",

            "content": "Antonio Rocco Caponigro (January 22, 1912 \u2013 April 18, 1980), also known as Tony Bananas, was the consigliere of Angelo Bruno in the Philadelphia crime family. He is known for ending the peaceful Bruno regime by ordering his murder over a dispute concerning the methamphetamine trade.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCaponigro was born in Chicago, Illinois on June 22, 1912. He operated in the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. As a made member of the Philadelphia crime family in the 1950s and 1960s, he became a recognized crime figure after being identified by mob turncoat Joseph Valachi in 1963. During that time he served under capo Riccardo Biondi. He was the son of a wealthy banana merchant who owned and managed a stand at the Italian Market, otherwise known as the South 9th Street Curb Market.\nHe lived in Short Hills, New Jersey. He had a wife, Kathleen, who died in 1991. He also had a half sister, Susan, who had a daughter out of wedlock by the name of Teresa. Susan Caponigro married Alfred Salerno. In 1955, Susan, at age 38 (approximately), was found dead. It was believed that she was murdered but the murder was covered up and classified as death by myocardial infarction. Connected wiseguys in the neighborhood believed that Freddy Salerno, with the okay of Susan's brother, Caponigro, murdered his wife, Susan.\n\n\n== Rise to power ==\nHe rose in rank to become the consigliere during the 1970s. Caponigro foresaw the end of the peaceful Angelo Bruno regime and decided to put the task upon himself to hasten it. Indictments for racketeering were being brought against the ailing Angelo, and there was no leadership in the methamphetamine industry. Caponigro knew that he could count on the support of several key members of Bruno's administration after the don died.\nAccordingly, Caponigro traveled to New York City to consult his friend Frank Tieri, from the Genovese crime family. Caponigro controlled a lucrative numbers operation in Newark, a holdover from the 1960s when the New York families had ceded parts of North Jersey to the Philadelphia crime family. Tieri also had activities in the area, and he had challenged Caponigro's incursion. Caponigro appealed the territorial dispute to The Commission, which, acting on Bruno's recommendation, ruled in favor of Caponigro. Caponigro approached Tieri with a plan to murder Bruno and take over the Philadelphia crime family. Tieri assured Caponigro that he would support him before the Commission. He returned to Philadelphia believing that his planned coup was now officially sanctioned. He recruited the support of his brother-in-law Alfred Salerno (no relation to mob turncoat Joseph Salerno or mob boss Anthony Salerno) and Bruno regime capos John Simone and Frank Sindone, and ordered the assassination.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBruno was shot once, behind the right ear, and his driver, John Stanfa, was wounded while parked outside his Philadelphia home on March 21, 1980. When the Commission learned of Bruno's murder, Caponigro was summoned at once. He was told that the murder had not been sanctioned by the Commission, nor even considered by them. He turned helplessly to Frank Tieri, who sat in on the meeting. When he identified Tieri as the man who had authorized the murder, Tieri categorically denied it. The Commission ruled that Caponigro had murdered a Commission member without authorization, and they sentenced him to death.\nCaponigro was murdered by Joe \"Mad Dog\" Sullivan, a well-known mob enforcer in the Bronx, New York City. Sullivan admitted that he shot and killed Caponigro in an on-camera interview in 2010. On April 18, 1980, Tony's body was located in the trunk of a car in the South Bronx with 14 bullet wounds and knife wounds. His mouth and anus were stuffed with money as a sign that he had been killed because he was too greedy. Tieri was later given Caponigro's lucrative numbers operations in Newark.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nThe death of Angelo Bruno, his consigliere, and two capos threw the Philadelphia crime family wide open. With New York's blessing, Angelo Bruno's surviving underboss, Phil Testa, was appointed the new boss. After Caponigro murdered Bruno, Scarfo could return from his appointed exile in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Testa, now free of regulations, broke the honored tradition and appointed narcotics trafficker Peter Casella as underboss and Nicky Scarfo as consigliere.\nIn the 2015 film Legend, Caponigro is portrayed by the late British actor Alex Giannini.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Plumber: The True Story of How One Good Man Destroyed the Entire Philadelphia Mafia by Joseph Salerno and Stephen J.

            "content": "Keith Shawn Fimian is a businessman and politician in Virginia. He was the 2008 and 2010 Republican nominee for Virginia's 11th congressional district. Fimian lost both elections, the first by 12%, and the second by 0.4%.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nFimian is the second of seven children, with three brothers and three sisters. A Navy family, the Fimians moved frequently before settling in Virginia Beach when young Keith was nine years old.\nFimian attended The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia where he graduated with a B.B.A. degree in accounting. Fimian played on offense as a fullback for the school's football team. Following college, Fimian briefly played for the NFL's Cleveland Browns before being cut in August 1978.\n\n\n== Business career ==\nFimian is a former certified public accountant, and worked for seven years as an auditor and accountant during the 1980s. Fimian audited oilfield operations in Midland, Texas for the international accounting firm Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co. which later merged with the international accounting firm Klynveld Main Goerdeler to become KPMG, one of the Big Four accounting firms, with headquarters in the Netherlands. Fimian also worked for a year in the firm's executive offices in New York City.\nIn the 1980s, along with two other businessmen, he co-founded Radonics Co., which is now U.S. Inspect. The company has grown to become \"the nation's largest provider of residential and commercial property inspection services.\" Headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia, the company manages a network of thousands of independent contractors across the country. Fimian is currently the chairman of the company. Fimian faced controversy over his corporation's federal tax liens for unpaid taxes, which he says were the fault of his company's independent contractors and the company soon paid the debt.\nFimian is a co-inventor and holds one United States patent, and notes that, if elected, he would be only the fourth patent holder in Congress. Fimian and three partners invented a radon detection device patent filed under an applicant name of record of \"Gemini Research, Inc.\"\n\n\n== Non-profit work ==\nFimian is a member of the national board of directors of Legatus, a Roman Catholic group of business executives started by Domino's Pizza founder and philanthropist Tom Monaghan. Fimian faced attacks from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which sent out mailings criticizing the group's \"radical agenda\" of opposition to abortion and contraception. Fimian and some Catholic leaders accused Connolly and the DCCC of religious bigotry, with one blog saying the mailings were \"inflammatory and extremely anti-Catholic toward a group of business leaders who follow their faith.\"\nHe is president of the Washington, D.C.-based Youth Leadership Foundation, a supplemental academic and character formation program serving disadvantaged youth in the nation's capital.\n\n\n== Political campaigns ==\n\n\n=== 2008 U.S. Congressional campaign ===\n\nFimian was defeated by Democratic nominee Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Gerry Connolly by more than ten points for the open seat held by Republican incumbent Tom Davis.\nDavis had represented Virginia's 11th congressional district since 1995. He announced on January 30, 2008 that he would not seek reelection to an eighth term, allowing other Republican candidates to run. Fimian announced his candidacy early in the year and, according to The Washington Post, had raised over $1,200,000 as of June 2008. Over the entire election cycle, Fimian raised $1,995,215, spent $1,985,087, and ended his campaign with $10,127 cash on hand. Fimian raised significantly more money than Connolly in individual donations; 76% of all his fundraising came from individual donations.\nFimian was portrayed as too extreme for the district and was criticized in Connolly's campaign literature for being opposed to embryonic stem cell research  and abortion unless the life of the mother is at risk. Other political opponents noted that the health insurance plans he offered to his own corporation's employees specifically exclude coverage for contraceptives and abortion services, even if the patient's life was at risk.\n\n\n=== 2010 U.S. Congressional campaign ===\n\nFimian again challenged Democratic incumbent Gerry Connolly. Also running were Libertarian nominee David L. Dotson, Independent Green David William Gillis, Jr., and Independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. Fimian lost by 981 votes out of 226,951 votes cast, or 0.43%.\n\n\n==== Republican primary ====\nOn July 20, 2009, Fimian announced his intention to run again for the 11th District seat against Connolly in 2010.\nPat Herrity, a Fairfax County Board of Supervisors member and colleague of Connolly when he was on the board, announced his intent to challenge Connolly, setting up a primary. The race was described by the Washington Post as \"one of the nastiest contests in the commonwealth,\" while the Washington Examiner called it \"unusually brutal.\" The race was significantly more heated than the primary in the neighboring 8th District, where issues such as abortion and gay marriage divided the two candidates. Fimian criticized Herrity relentlessly for his legislative record, accusing him of voting to raise taxes and being insufficiently conservative. Herrity said he was the only Republican who could beat Connolly and was accused by Fimian of spreading rumors about him, including the 1976 assault case.\nFimian defeated Herrity in the June 8, 2010 primary, winning 56% of the vote, with 35,890 votes cast.\n\n\n==== General election campaign ====\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee promoted Fimian to be a GOP Young Gun in June 2010, which meant his campaign had hit certain targets for fundraising and other organizational indicators. As of September 30, 2010, Fimian had raised $2,197,60 while Connolly had raised $2,160,041. However, that includes $95,000 which Fimian contributed to his own campaign.\nTerry McAuliffe, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor of Virginia in 2009, said at a Connolly fundraiser that if Connolly loses his seat, \"we [Democrats] will lose the House.\" Former congressman Tom Davis, who held the seat until retiring in 2008, agreed, saying, \"If they [Republicans] take my seat, they'll take the House.\" CNN said the \"rematch could set the tone on election night,\" especially since Virginia's polling places are among the first to close at 7:00 pm EST. The National Journal named it to a list of five House bellwethers, noting the parallel to 1994, when a similar Republican wave swept 11th District Rep. Leslie Byrne, a freshman Democrat, from office.\n\n\n==== Endorsements ====\nFimian has garnered notable and prominent endorsements to include Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli who praised Fimian as \"100% pro-life.\" The conservative talk show host Mark Levin has given support to Fimian. Fimian has also picked up the endorsements of Republican House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, Delegate Robert G. \"Bob\" Marshall, Prince William County Board of Supervisors chair Corey A. Stewart, and Prince William County Supervisor Mike May.\nFimian received support from members of the Tea Party movement and attended a Northern Virginia Tea Party Patriots rally in the summer of 2009 at Connolly's congressional office. The Tea Party movement is targeting the 11th District for a conservative pickup. Northern Virginia political columnist Davon Gray wrote that the Tea Party \"probably made a huge difference in Keith Fimian's nomination in the 11th congressional district.\"\nFimian was endorsed by FreedomWorks PAC after signing the Contract from America.\n\n\n== Political action committee ==\nIn September 2011, Fimian started the Growth, Opportunity, and Prosperity (GOP) Fund, a political action committee which seeks \"to elect pro-business candidates dedicated to keeping Virginia a great state for business by building a vibrant economy in every corner of the Commonwealth.\" The PAC had raised over $235,000 by its first Federal Election Commission quarterly filing deadline on September 30, 2011, and had raised over $300,000 by its first state filing deadline on October 17, 2011. Fimian proceeded to give nearly $100,000 in PAC money to Republican candidates for the General Assembly and local offices in the 2011 elections, making contributions to 47 candidates (including the maximum $5,000 contribution to a dozen state Senate candidates).\n\n\n== Potential subsequent runs for office ==\nIn November 2011, Fimian said he was considering running for Lieutenant Governor in 2013, saying, \"I\u2019m giving it thought. There are a lot of people who are encouraging me to do that, and I\u2019m considering it.\" Fimian ultimately decided not to run.\nFimian was mentioned as a potential candidate for the 10th District election in 2014 after Frank Wolf announced he would not seek re-election, but opted not to run.\n\n\n== Political positions ==\nFimian supports a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and proposes in his platform to tackle individual health care problems with \"stand alone legislation\". He estimates \"most Americans like the coverage they have.\"\nFimian has made energy issues a central component of his political platform. He favors an expansion of offshore oil drilling where possible and has been interviewed about his energy policy positions by the news media. In response to a U.S. Department of Defense study concluding that drilling off Virginia's coastline would interfere with military activities and equipment covering 72% of the area, Fimian responded \"so that still leaves one quarter\" (for exploration and production), and suggested the use of directional drilling to access deposits and the drilling of areas north of the \"tidewater\" areas where leases have been proposed.\nFimian has advocated for ratification of new free trade agreements to spur economic growth. He believes in securing the southern border with Mexico while streamlining the immigration process, and a strong national defense.\nOn fiscal matters, he supports reducing federal spending through a federal balanced budget amendment, has proposed privatizing social security, and abolishing the United States Department of Education. He proposes simplifying the Internal Revenue Code, and has also pledged to oppose any and all tax increases.\nOn constitutional issues, according to his website, he is pro-life, opposes same-sex marriage, and supports Second Amendment rights. Fimian is opposed to voting representation in Congress for District of Columbia residents Fimian encountered controversy when he was asked about the idea of repealing the Seventeenth Amendment, which allowed for the direct election of U.S. senators, who were appointed by the state legislatures until the amendment was ratified. In a June 4, 2010 WTOP Radio debate preceding the Republican primary between Fimian and Herrity, host Mark Plotkin asked the two candidates whether they would support repealing the 17th Amendment. Then Fimian said, \"There is some merit to that. Why it was changed in 1910...I'm not totally sure. There is merit. And frankly, I would entertain hearing both sides of that argument before I would say yes or no, but I am inclined to say no.\"\nOn economic issues, Fimian opposes tax increases, supports eliminating the capital gains tax on start-up companies and cutting the payroll tax in half for small businesses until unemployment is reduced to 5%.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nFimian has been married to his wife Cathy for 26 years. They have three daughters and reside in Oakton, VA. His brother Kevin is a Roman Catholic priest in the Diocese of Arlington.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Conservatism portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Campaign website\n\nProfile at Project Vote Smart\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nCampaign contributions (2008) at OpenSecrets.org\nCampaign contributions (2010) at OpenSecrets.org",

Millard became an autoworker after his small business failed as a result of the Great Depression.\n\n\n== Union activism ==\nEmployed by General Motors in Oshawa, Ontario, Millard was involved in the organizing auto workers in the 1930s and was elected the first president of the new United Auto Workers local 222 in Oshawa leading his union out on strike in 1937 after GM refused to recognize the union. The 18-day-long strike was successful and Millard's local obtained the first contract in Canada between an automobile manufacturer and its workers. Millard was elected the first Canadian director of the United Auto Workers, was a full-time organizer for the CIO and was also elected to the provincial executive of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Ontario. Millard was active in championing the CCF within the union against the Communist Party of Canada, and was viewed as some as a divisive force.\nIn 1939, he was defeated in his bid for re-election as the UAW's Canadian director by George Burt who was the candidate of the \"Unity Caucus\" composed of Communists, left-wing CCFers and other militants who viewed Millard as right-wing.\nCIO president John L. Lewis appointed Millard secretary of the CIO in Canada and then as the first head of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in Canada (SWOC) became the United Steel Workers of America in 1942 with Millard as Canadian director and was active in purging Communists from the SWOC. Millard was also an executive member of the Canadian Congress of Labour and played a role in establishing the United Packinghouse Workers in Canada.\nMillard stepped down as Canadian director in 1947 but resumed the post in the 1950s.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nMillard was initially critical of World War II - in December 1939 he was arrested under the Defence of Canada Regulations after telling workers in Timmins that \"[we] should have democracy here in Canada before we go to Europe to defend it.\" As a result, Millard was jailed and the Canadian offices of the CIO being raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\n\n== Creation of the Canadian Labour Congress ==\nIn the mid-1950s, Millard played a role in negotiating the merger of the Canadian Congress of Labour (CCL) with the rival Trades and Labour Congress of Canada becoming vice-president of the new body, the Canadian Labour Congress, at its founding in 1956. In the late 1950s he was also director of organizing for the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in Brussels, Belgium.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nHe served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a CCF Member of Provincial Parliament for the Toronto area riding of York West from 1943 to 1945 and again from 1948 to 1951 and was also the party's vice president through much of the 1940s. In the early 1960s, he supported the creation of the New Democratic Party as a party with formal affiliation with the Canadian Labour Congress. He was a candidate for the federal CCF in the 1953 federal election and for the federal NDP in the 1962 and 1963 federal elections but failed in his bid to become a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons.\n\n\n== Religious views ==\nA Christian Socialist, Millard was involved with the United Church of Canada and the Religious Labor Foundation\n\n\n== Death ==\nHe died in Toronto in 1978.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOntario Legislative Assembly parliamentary history",

            "content": "The Davis Cup is the premier international team event in men's tennis. It is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is contested annually between teams from competing countries in a knock-out format. It is described by the organisers as the \"World Cup of Tennis\", and the winners are referred to as the World Champion team. The competition began in 1900 as a challenge between Great Britain and the United States. By 2016, 135 nations entered teams into the competition. The most successful countries over the history of the tournament are the United States (winning 32 tournaments and finishing as runners-up 29 times) and Australia (winning 28 times, including four occasions with New Zealand as Australasia, and finishing as runners-up 19 times). The present champions are France, who beat Belgium to win their tenth title in 2017.\nThe women's equivalent of the Davis Cup is the Fed Cup. Australia, the Czech Republic, and the United States are the only countries to have held both Davis Cup and Fed Cup titles in the same year. The Hopman Cup, a third competition for mixed teams, carries less prestige, but is a popular curtain raiser to the tennis season.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe tournament was conceived in 1899 by four members of the Harvard University tennis team who wished to challenge the British to a tennis competition. Once their respective lawn tennis associations agreed, one of the four Harvard players, Dwight F. Davis, designed a tournament format and ordered an appropriate sterling silver trophy from Shreve, Crump & Low, purchasing it from his own funds for about $1,000. They in turn commissioned a classically styled design from William B. Durgin's of Concord, New Hampshire, crafted by the Englishman Rowland Rhodes. Davis went on to become a prominent politician in the United States in the 1920s, serving as US Secretary of War from 1925 to 1929 and as Governor-General of the Philippines from 1929 to 1932.\nThe first match, between the United States and Britain (competing as the \"British Isles\"), was held at the Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts in 1900. The American team, of which Dwight Davis was a part, surprised the British by winning the first three matches. The following year the two countries did not compete, but the US won the match in 1902 and Britain won the following four matches. By 1905 the tournament expanded to include Belgium, Austria, France, and Australasia, a combined team from Australia and New Zealand that competed together until 1914.\nThe tournament was initially titled the International Lawn Tennis Challenge although it soon became known as the Davis Cup, after Dwight Davis' trophy. The Davis Cup competition was initially played as a challenge cup. All teams competed against one another for the right to face the previous year's champion in the final round.\nBeginning in 1923, the world's teams were split into two zones: the \"America Zone\" and the \"Europe Zone\". The winners of the two zones met in the Inter-Zonal Zone (\"INZ\") to decide which national team would challenge the defending champion for the cup. In 1955 a third zone, the \"Eastern Zone\", was added. Because there were three zones, the winner of one of the three zones received a bye in the first round of the INZ challenger rounds. In 1966, the \"Europe Zone\" was split into two zones, \"Europe Zone A\" and \"Europe Zone B\", so the winners of the four zones competed in the INZ challenger rounds.\nFrom 1950 to 1967, Australia dominated the competition, winning the Cup 15 times in 18 years.\nBeginning in 1972, the format was changed to a knockout tournament, so that the defending champion was required to compete in all rounds, and the Davis Cup was awarded to the tournament champion.\nUp until 1973, the Davis Cup had only ever been won by the United States, Great Britain/British Isles, France and Australia/Australasia. Their domination was eventually broken in 1974 when South Africa and India made the final; however the final was scratched and South Africa awarded the cup after India refused to travel to South Africa in protest at South Africa's apartheid policies. The following year saw the first actual final between two \"outsider\" nations, when Sweden beat Czechoslovakia 3\u20132, and since then, many other countries have gone on to capture the trophy.\nIn 1981, the tiered system of competition in use today was created, in which the 16 best national teams compete in the World Group and all other national teams compete in one of four groups in one of three regional zones. In 1989, the tiebreak was introduced into Davis Cup competition, and from 2016 it is used in all five sets.\nDavis Cup games have been affected by political protests several times, especially in Sweden:\nThe match between Sweden and Rhodesia 1968 was supposed to be played in B\u00e5stad but was moved to Bandol, France, due to protests against the Rhodesian white minority government of Ian Smith.\nThe Swedish government tried to stop the match between Chile and Sweden in 1975 in B\u00e5stad, due to violations of human rights in Chile. The match was played, even while 7,000 people protested against it outside.\nAfter the 2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, 6,000 people protested against Israel outside the Malm\u00f6 city Davis Cup match between Sweden and Israel in March 2009. The Malm\u00f6 Municipality politicians were concerned about extremists, and decided due to security reasons to only let a small audience in.\n\n\n== Format ==\n\n\n=== Tournament ===\nThe 16 best national teams are assigned to the World Group and compete annually for the Davis Cup. Nations which are not in the World Group compete in one of three regional zones (Americas, Asia/Oceania, and Europe/Africa). The competition is spread over four weekends during the year. Each elimination round between competing nations is held in one of the countries, and is played as the best of five matches (4 singles, 1 doubles). The ITF determines the host countries for all possible matchups before each year's tournament.\nThe World Group is the top group and includes the world's best 16 national teams. Teams in the World Group play a four-round elimination tournament. Teams are seeded based on a ranking system released by the ITF, taking into account previous years' results. The defending champion and runner-up are always the top two seeds in the tournament. The losers of the first-round matches are sent to the World Group playoff round, where they play along with winners from Group I of the regional zones. The playoff round winners play in the World Group for the next year's tournament, while the losers play in Group I of their respective regional zone.\nEach of the three regional zones is divided into four groups. Groups I and II play elimination rounds, with the losing teams facing relegation to the next-lower group. The teams in Groups III and those in Group IV play a round-robin tournament with promotion and relegation.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nNote: The total number of nations in Group One is 24. However, the distribution among the three zones may vary each year, according to the number of nations promoted or relegated between Group One and the World Group. The number of nations in the World Group and Group One together is 22 from Euro/Africa Zone, 9 from Americas Zone and 9 from Asia/Oceania Zone.\n\n\n=== Ties and rubbers ===\nAs in other cup competitions tie is used in the Davis Cup to mean an elimination round. In the Davis Cup, the word rubber means an individual match.\nIn the annual World Group competition, 16 nations compete in eight first-round ties; the eight winners compete in four quarterfinal ties; the four winners compete in two semifinal ties; and the two winners compete in the final tie.\nEach tie consists of five rubbers, which are played in three days (usually on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). The winner of the tie is the nation which wins three or more of the five rubbers in the tie. On the first day, the first two rubbers are singles, which are generally played by each nation's two best available singles players. On the second day, the doubles rubber is played. On the third day, the final two rubbers are typically reverse singles, in which the first-day contestants usually play again, but they swap opponents from the first day's singles rubbers. However, in certain circumstances, the team captain may replace one or two of the players who played the singles on Friday by other players who were nominated for the tie. For example, if the tie has already been decided in favour of one of the teams, it is common for younger or lower-ranked team members to play the remaining dead rubbers in order for them to gain Davis Cup experience.\nSince 2011, if a nation has a winning 3\u20131 lead after the first reverse single match and that match has gone to four sets or more, then the remaining reverse single match which is a dead rubber is not played. All five rubbers are played if one nation has a winning 3\u20130 lead after the doubles match.\nTies are played at a venue chosen by one of the competing countries. The right of choice is given on an alternating basis. Therefore, countries play in the country where the last tie between the teams was not held. In case the two countries have not met since 1970, lots are drawn to determine the host country.\nVenues in the World Group must comply with certain minimum standards, including a minimum seating capacity as follows:\nWorld Group play-offs: 4,000\nWorld Group first round: 4,000\nWorld Group quarterfinals: 6,000\nWorld Group semifinals: 8,000\nWorld Group final: 12,000\n\n\n=== Captain ===\nPrior to each tie, the captain (non-playing coach appointed by the national association) nominates a squad of four players and decides who will compete in the tie. On the day before play starts, the order of play for the first day is drawn at random. In the past, teams could substitute final day singles players only in case of injury or illness, verified by a doctor, but current rules permit the captain to designate any player to play the last two singles rubbers, provided that no first day matchup is repeated. There is no restriction on which of the playing team members may play the doubles rubber: the two singles players, two other players (usually doubles specialists) or a combination.\nEach rubber is normally played as best of five sets. Since 2016, all sets use a tiebreak at 6\u20136 if necessary (formerly, the fifth set usually had no tiebreaker, so play continued until one side won by two games e.g. 10\u20138). However, if a team has clinched the tie before all five rubbers have been completed, the remaining rubbers may be shortened to best of three sets, with a tiebreak if necessary to decide all three sets.\nIn Group III and Group IV competitions, each tie consists only of three rubbers, which include two singles and one doubles rubber, which is played in a single day. The rubbers are in the best of three sets format, with a tie breaker if necessary to decide all three sets.\n\n\n== Records and statistics ==\n\n\n=== Team ===\n\n+ - also has Junior Davis Cup title\n\n\n=== Titles by country (since 1972) ===\nConsecutive titles\nAll-time: 7, United States, 1920\u20131926\nPost-Challenge Round: 2; United States, 1978\u201379, 1981\u201382; Sweden, 1984\u201385, 1997\u201398; West Germany, 1988\u201389; Spain, 2008\u201309; Czech Republic, 2012\u201313\n\nConsecutive finals appearances\nAll-time: 23, Australia, 1946\u20131968\nPost-Challenge Round: 7, Sweden, 1983\u20131989\n\nMost number of games in a tie\nAll-time: 327, India 3\u20132 Australia, 1974 Eastern Zone final\nWorld Group (before tiebreak): 281, Paraguay 3\u20132 France, 1985 first round\nWorld Group (since tiebreak): 281, Romania 3\u20132 Ecuador, 2003 World Group play-offs\n\n\n=== Years in World Group ===\n\n\n=== Most wins in World Group ===",

            "content": "The East Coast Railway (abbreviated ECoR and \u092a\u0942\u0924\u0930\u0947) is one of the seventeen railway zones of Indian Railways. It came into existence on 1 April 2003. As the name suggests, most of the railway routes of the zone are near the east coast of India.\n\n\n== History ==\nConsequent upon the parliament\u2019s approval, East Coast Railway was the first of the seven new zones to be inaugurated by the then Prime Minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda on 8 August 1996. The Officer-on-Special Duty took over charge of the newly declared Zone on 16 September 1996. Initially, only one division namely Khurda Road was attached to this railway.\nSubsequently, the zone became fully operational with effect from 1 April 2003.\n\n\n== Divisions ==\nThe geographical jurisdiction of East Coast Railway zone extends over three states encompassing almost all of Odisha along with parts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts of northeastern Andhra Pradesh and Bastar and Dantewada districts of Chhattisgarh state. The zonal headquarters is at Bhubaneswar in Odisha.\nThe zone has three divisions: Sambalpur, Khurda Road and Waltair.\n\n\n== Electrification ==\nThe East Coast Railway line integrated with the commissioned Howrah-Chennai electrified trunk route on 29 November 2005. There was a missing link between Kharagpur and Visakhapatnam stations and all trains from Howrah towards Chennai side had to undergo a locomotive change from electric to diesel at Kharagpur and vice versa at Visakhapatnam in order to pass through Odisha. Even trains from New Delhi such as the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani had to undergo the change at Kharagpur. This frequent loco change on a trunk route became a time consuming & inconvenient process. With electrification along the 765 km Kharagpur-Visakhapatnam stretch, trains got speeded up and the need for double headed diesels for high speed express trains was eliminated thus saving on diesel consumption and a cleaner travel. Additionally the line branching off Khurda road towards Puri was also electrified. Gradually the Cuttack-Angul line, Cuttack-Paradeep line and branch line from Jakhapura towards Barbil got electrified too.\n\n\n== Major railway stations ==\nThe major railway stations in the entire zone are visakhapatnam railway station Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Khurda Road, Bhadrak, Jajpur Keonjhar Road, Brahmapur , Sambalpur, Titlagarh, Kantabanji, Rayagada, Koraput, Jagdalpur, Araku, Palasa, Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam Road and Vizianagaram\nMost of the major stations fall in the state of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\n\n\n== Rail infrastructure ==\nElectric Loco Shed- Angul\nDiesel Loco Shed- Visakhapatnam\nElectric Loco Shed- Visakhapatnam\nCarriage Repair Workshop- Mancheswar, Bhubaneswar\n\n\n== Routes ==\nEast Coast Railway zone has about 273 railway stations with a track length of 5214 km spread as follows:-\n\n\n=== Railway lines ===\nECoR zone has below tracks. All are (1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in)) broad gauge.

Because Oxenholme does not have its own church it is technically a hamlet.\n\n\n== History ==\nOxenholme station opened in 1847 as Kendal Junction and was renamed Oxenholme in 1860. The village grew around the station and is named after Oxenholme Farm. The station name had the suffix \"Lake District\" added in 1988.\nThe Grayrigg rail crash happened on 23 February 2007 between Oxenholme and Tebay on the West Coast Main Line.\n\n\n== Name ==\nOxenholme is named after a farm which name suggests was a cow farm. It is pronounced Oxen-Home. The village has always been called and spelt Oxenholme.\n\n\n== Governance ==\nThe village is part of the Kendal civil parish.\nThe village is in the Kendal Oxenholme and Natland ward in South Lakeland and is currently represented by the Liberal Democrat Brenda Gray. The village is in Cumbria but before 1974 was in Westmorland.

Most of the news is to do with the railway.\nOn 10 February 1965 fugitive John Middleton shot two policemen while hiding in the waiting room at Oxenholme railway station. Carlisle policemen George Russell and Alex Archibald were shot, and Russell died in hospital a few hours later.\nOn 27 May 2006, a 19-year-old man was stabbed aboard a Glasgow-Paignton train as it was coming into the station. A 22-year-old man was jailed for 21 years for the murder in November 2006.\nThe Grayrigg rail crash happened on 23 February 2007 when a Virgin Pendolino train derailed just after leaving the station.

            "content": "New York State Route 446 (NY 446) is a state highway in the Southern Tier of New York in the United States. The highway extends for 6.76 miles (10.88 km) on a northeast\u2013southwest alignment from an intersection with NY 16 north of the hamlet of Hinsdale to a junction with NY 305 in the village of Cuba. It parallels the Southern Tier Expressway (NY 17 and Interstate 86 or I-86) very closely for its entire length. NY 446 was originally designated as part of Route 4, an unsigned legislative route, in 1908. The Hinsdale\u2013Cuba highway received its first posted designation in 1924 when it was included as part of NY 17. It was renumbered twice, becoming part of NY 63 in 1930 and NY 408 in the 1940s, before gaining its current designation on July 1, 1974.\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\nNY 446 begins at an intersection with NY 16 in the Hinsdale hamlet of Maplehurst, located a quarter-mile (0.40 km) north of exit 27 on the Southern Tier Expressway (I-86 and NY 17) and roughly one mile (1.6 km) north of the larger community of Hinsdale. The route heads northeast through the town of Hinsdale along the base of a valley surrounding Oil Creek. While NY 446 follows the north bank of the creek, the Southern Tier Expressway and the adjacent Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad (WNYP) run along the southern bank.\nNear the Cattaraugus\u2013Allegany county line, Route 446, Oil Creek, and the WNYP all turn east toward Cuba; however, the expressway continues on a northeasterly alignment to bypass the village to the north. Upon entering Allegany County, NY 446 passes under the Southern Tier Expressway and becomes known as Water Street as it enters Cuba from the west upon traversing Oil Creek. The route continues eastward for three blocks to NY 305 (Genesee Street), where both Water Street and NY 446 terminate approximately a quarter-mile (0.40 km) south of exit 28 on the Southern Tier Expressway.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAll of modern NY 446 was originally designated as part of Route 4, a cross-state unsigned legislative route defined by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route 4 continued south from Hinsdale on what is now NY 16 and east from the village of Cuba on County Route 20. The legislative route system was replaced by the modern state route system in 1924, at which time most of Route 4 was designated NY 17, including from Hinsdale to Cuba. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 17 was moved onto a more southerly alignment (now NY 417) between Olean and Wellsville. Its former routing between Hinsdale and the Amity hamlet of Belvidere became the southwesternmost part of the new NY 63, which continued north from Belvidere to the Lake Ontario shoreline.\nNY 63 was rerouted south of Mount Morris in the early 1940s to follow its current alignment to Wayland. The former alignment of NY 63 from Hinsdale to Mount Morris was redesignated as NY 408. In the early 1970s, construction began on the portion of the Southern Tier Expressway between Olean and Corning. From Hinsdale to Belvidere, the new highway closely followed NY 408. By 1974, the highway was open from Olean to Hinsdale and from Almond to Corning. The segment between Hinsdale and NY 19 in Belvidere was completed by January 1975, and the leg between Belvidere and Almond opened to traffic on January 30, 1975, completing the Olean\u2013Corning portion of the expressway. The bypassed section of NY 408 between Cuba and Belvidere was subsequently transferred to Allegany County, and NY 408 was truncated to its current southern terminus in Nunda as a result. The portion of NY 408's former routing between Hinsdale and Cuba was retained as a state highway and renumbered to NY 446 on July 1, 1974.\n\n\n== Major intersections ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n New York Roads portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nNew York State Route 446 at New York Routes",

It made its first appearance in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Miracle! magazine with the June 2012 issue. An anime adaptation produced by Production IMS and directed by Noriaki Akitaya premiered in Japan on July 2, 2015.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Sakurada family live a normal life in a typical Japanese suburban household. At least that is what their father, who is the king, wants for them. As members of a royal family, each sibling possesses a unique superpower and over 2,000 security cameras have been placed around town to ensure that no harm befalls the siblings. In addition to that, each of the nine Sakurada siblings have been designated as a potential successor to become king, and the only way to do that is through an election.\nHowever, for the timid, soft-spoken and shy Akane Sakurada, who wields the power to control and manipulate gravity, all of this attention is nothing short of a nightmare. With all of the cameras constantly monitoring their activities and even broadcasting them on a television channel specially dedicated to the Sakurada family, she knows that if she becomes king, then all of the cameras must disappear.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== Sakurada family ===\nAkane Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u831c, Sakurada Akane)\nVoiced by: Kana Hanazawa (Japanese); Bryn Apprill (English)\nThe main protagonist of the series. Akane is the third daughter and fourth child of the Sakurada family. She hates being the center of attention, due to a childhood trauma and being followed by cameras all day, and as such aims to be king to get rid of the cameras, despite how ironically she would get more attention on herself if she succeeds. She adores her family & friends and likes to rely on Sh\u016b. Her ability is Gravity Core, which allows her to manipulate the gravity of herself and anyone she touches, as well as allowing her to increase her speed and strength. Despite her shyness, she has a strong sense of justice and is her class' representative. She's completely unaware that she has a fan club at school. Once, Aoi and Kanade wanted her to become a more confident person so they give her an alter-ego as a superhero named Scarlett Bloom (\u30b9\u30ab\u30fc\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30e0, Suk\u0101retto Bur\u016bmu), basing her on a fictional television superhero, Rose Typhoon. Akane thinks this as a great disguise not knowing that the citizens and the Sakurada siblings were all aware of her true identity and only played along with the charade for her.\nAoi Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u8475, Sakurada Aoi)\nVoiced by: Ai Kayano (Japanese); Tia Ballard (English)\nEldest child of the Sakurada family. Her ability is originally said to be Invisible Work, which allows her to do anything once she has learned it. However this is only a front for her true ability , Absolute Order, which allows her to order anyone under her bidding but she keeps this as a secret from everyone except her father, as she is afraid of this power and has very little control over it. It is also because of this that she feels she does not deserve to be king, despite having the highest chance according to the pre-election rankings. In the manga her true ability is revealed as \"Brave Believer\", which is a power which gives people the push to lay their feelings bare and act on what they want to do but are hesitant to do so.\nSh\u016b Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u4fee, Sakurada Sh\u016b)\nVoiced by: Ry\u014dhei Kimura (Japanese); Ricco Fajardo, Terri Doty (young) (English)\nSecond child and eldest son of the Sakurada family. He is the twin of Kanade. His ability is Transporter, which allows him to teleport him and anyone he touches to a certain location. He has stated that he is too busy making sure Kanade is not chosen as king to be campaigning for and try to become king himself, despite knowing her agenda to become one. Although not really showing it, Sh\u016b has a crush on Hana from his childhood, which makes it a reason why he prefers girls with pigtails. In the past, Sh\u016b wanted to become a professional soccer player but Kanade accidentally injured his legs which resulted in his current condition preventing him from joining advanced sports. He is the second member of the Akane Fan Club which makes it easier for him to watch out for her. He greatly adores Kanade as well. He greatly resembles his father when his father was his age.\nKanade Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u594f, Sakurada Kanade)\nVoiced by: Kaori Ishihara (Japanese); Michelle Rojas (English)\nThird child and second daughter of the Sakurada family. She is the twin of Sh\u016b. Her ability is Heaven's Gate, which allows her to create objects using materials within a certain area. In order to materialize them, she has to pay the amount of money it takes to use the requested object, which forces her to hold down a job and keep a vast amount of money estimated to be as much as the country's national savings. She is the vice president of the Student Council. Among her siblings, Kanade has the strongest desire to become king. Because she accidentally injured Sh\u016b's legs in the past, Kanade's motive for becoming the king is to advance the country's medical system in order to cure him and correct her past mistake. She greatly adores Sh\u016b.\nHaruka Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u9065, Sakurada Haruka)\nVoiced by: Ayumu Murase (Japanese); Josh Grelle (English)\nSixth child and middle son of the Sakurada family. He is the twin of Misaki. His ability is Lots of Next, which allows him to calculate the possibilities of a situation effortlessly. He tends to be the straight man in the antics of his siblings. Haruka is one of two Sakuraba siblings (along with Aoi) who do not take interest in the election, as he wants to support Misaki.\nMisaki Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u5cac, Sakurada Misaki)\nVoiced by: Eriko Matsui (Japanese); Jad Saxton (English)\nFifth child and fourth daughter of the Sakurada family. She is the twin of Haruka. Her ability is All for One, which allows her to multiply herself up to seven times, which all represent aspects of her personality and the seven deadly sins: Yuniko (\u30e6\u30cb\u30b3) (wrath), Revi (\u30ec\u30f4\u30a3) (envy), Inari (\u30a4\u30ca\u30ea) (greed), Bubu (\u30d6\u30d6) (gluttony), Bell (\u30d9\u30eb) (sloth), Shaura (\u30b7\u30e3\u30a6\u30e9) (lust), and Raio (\u30e9\u30a4\u30aa) (pride). Since each copy excels in each of their aspects, Misaki gets annoyed that that makes her look bland in comparison as she doesn't excel in anything.\nHikari Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u5149, Sakurada Hikari)\nVoiced by: Yui Ogura (Japanese); Sarah Wiedenheft (English)\nSeventh child and fifth daughter of the Sakurada family. Her ability is God Hand, which allows her to increase or reverse the growth of a living being for 24 hours. Inspired by Sacchan's performance, Hikari tries to become an idol, under the name Light Sakuraba (\u685c\u5ead \u3089\u3044\u3068, Sakuraba Raito), but finds it futile to draw votes for her since she isn't using her real name or age as an idol.\nTeru Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u8f1d, Sakurada Teru)\nVoiced by: Shiori Katsuta (Japanese); Jeannie Tirado (English)\nEighth child and youngest son of the Sakurada family.

Despite being the youngest of the nine, she's actually thoughtful and observant.\nS\u014dichir\u014d Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u7dcf\u4e00\u90ce, Sakurada S\u014dichir\u014d)\nVoiced by: Dai Matsumoto, Ry\u014dhei Kimura (young) (Japanese); Phil Parsons, Ricco Fajardo (young) (English)\nS\u014dichir\u014d is the father of the nine Sakurada children and the king. He cares for his family so much that he secretly hires a SAT team whenever his children are alone at home. His parents died when he was younger, and as a result he became king in his first year of high school. His royal ability allows him to read people's emotions through their aura.\nSatsuki Sakurada (\u6afb\u7530 \u4e94\u6708, Sakurada Satsuki)\nVoiced by: Satsuki Yukino (Japanese); Stephanie Young (English)\nSatsuki is the mother of the nine Sakurada children and the queen.

She comes from a family of five siblings, and was S\u014dichir\u014d's first friend as she was the only person willing to interact with him despite knowing his royalty.\nBorscht (\u30dc\u30eb\u30b7\u30c1, Borushichi)\nVoiced by: Sh\u014d Hayami (Japanese); Christopher R. Sabat (English)\nThe Sakurada family's pet cat, it was first picked and adopted by Hikari. Borscht likes to chew plastic bags than cat food after claiming that even the taste of a royal cooking \"loses\" to a plastic bag. He also likes Akane and always sleeps on her chest as it feels like his old shelter, much to Hikari's dismay, since she thinks of herself as his true owner.\n\n\n=== Others ===\nHana Sat\u014d (\u4f50\u85e4 \u82b1, Sat\u014d Hana)\nVoiced by: Yuka Aisaka (Japanese); Jill Harris (English)\nHana is Sh\u016b's classmate from elementary school who moved out from the town.

Eventually, the two become lovers and Hana often helps Sh\u016b in his election campaign.\nKaren Ayugase (\u9b8e\u30b1\u702c \u82b1\u84ee, Ayugase Karen)\nVoiced by: Saori Hayami (Japanese); Kristen McGuire (English)\nKaren is Akane's classmate and childhood friend, always helping her whenever she is in trouble.

            "content": "The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (c 37) (abbreviated to \"HSWA 1974\", \"HASWA\" or \"HASAWA\") is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that as of 2011 defines the fundamental structure and authority for the encouragement, regulation and enforcement of workplace health, safety and welfare within the United Kingdom.\nThe Act defines general duties on employers, employees, contractors, suppliers of goods and substances for use at work, persons in control of work premises, and those who manage and maintain them, and persons in general. The Act enables a broad regime of regulation by government ministers through Statutory Instrument which has, in the years since 1974, generated an extensive system of specific provisions for various industries, disciplines and risks. It established a system of public supervision through the creation of the Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive, since merged, and bestows extensive enforcement powers, ultimately backed by criminal sanctions extending to unlimited fines and imprisonment for up to two years. Further, the Act provides a critical interface with the law of the European Union on workplace health and safety.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSecretary of State for Employment and Productivity Barbara Castle introduced an Employed Persons (Health and Safety) Bill in 1970 but the debate around the Bill soon generated a belief that it did not address fundamental issues of workplace safety. In the same year, the Occupational Safety and Health Act was passed into United States federal law. As a result, a committee of inquiry chaired by Lord Robens was established towards the end of Harold Wilson's first government. When the Conservative Party came to power following the United Kingdom general election, 1970, they gave Castle's Bill no parliamentary time, preferring to wait for the Robens Report which was published in 1972. Conservative Secretary of State for Employment William Whitelaw introduced a new Bill on 28 January 1974 but Labour were returned to power in the United Kingdom general election, February 1974 and the Bill again lost. The new Labour administration finally secured the passage of a Bill that year.\n\n\n== Structure of the Act ==\nThe Act lays down general principles for the management of health and safety at work, enabling the creation of specific requirements through regulations enacted as Statutory Instruments or through a code of practice. For example, the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (COSHH), the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at Work Regulations 1992 and the Health and Safety (First-Aid) Regulations 1981 are all Statutory Instruments that lay down detailed requirements. It was also the intention of the Act to rationalise the existing complex and confused system of legislation (section 1(2)).\nSince the accession of the UK to the European Union (EU) in 1972, much health and safety regulation has needed to comply with the law of the European Union and Statutory Instruments under the Act have been enacted in order to implement EU directives. In particular, the Act is the principal means of complying with Health and Safety Framework Directive 89/391/EEC on health and safety at work. Further important changes to section 6, duties in respect of articles and substances used at work, were made by the Consumer Protection Act 1987 in order to implement the Product Liability Directive 85/374/EEC.\n\n\n== Objectives ==\nSection 1 sets out the objectives of the Act as:\nSecuring the health, safety and welfare of persons at work;\nProtecting persons, other than persons at work, against risks to health or safety arising out of or in connection with the activities of persons at work;\nControlling the keeping and use of explosive or highly flammable or otherwise dangerous substances, and generally preventing the unlawful acquisition, possession and use of such substances.\nAs originally enacted, there was a fourth objective:\nControlling the emission into the atmosphere of noxious or offensive substances;\n\u2014 but this provision was repealed when control of emissions was brought under a uniform scheme of legislation by the Environmental Protection Act 1990. In general, the other provisions about emissions in the original Act have subsequently been repealed.\n\n\n== General duties ==\n\n\n=== Duties of employers ===\nSection 2 states that \"It shall be the duty of every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his/her employees\", and in particular that such a duty extends to:\nProvision and maintenance of plant and systems of work that are, so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risks to health;\nArrangements for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, safety and absence of risks to health in connection with the use, handling, storage and transport of articles and substances;\nProvision of such information, instruction, training and supervision as is necessary to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety at work of his employees;\nSo far as is reasonably practicable as regards any place of work under the employer\u2019s control, the maintenance of it in a condition that is safe and without risks to health and the provision and maintenance of means of access to and egress from it that are safe and without such risks;\nProvision and maintenance of a working environment for his employees that is, so far as is reasonably practicable, safe, without risks to health, and adequate as regards facilities and arrangements for their welfare at work.\nSection 3 states the duty of all employers and self-employed persons to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of persons other than employees, for example, contractors, visitors, the general public and clients.\nEmployers must also prepare and keep under review a safety policy and to bring it to the attention of his employees (s.2(2)). Trade unions may appoint safety representatives and demand safety committees. The representatives have a right to be consulted on safety issues (ss.2(4), (6) and (7)). Since 1996 employers have had a duty to consult all employees on safety matters. No employer may charge an employee for provision of health and safety arrangements (s.9).\nThe Act does not apply to domestic servants (s.51).\n\n\n=== Duties of persons having control of premises ===\nSection 4 defines a duty of occupiers of premises, for example commercial landlords, managers of serviced office accommodation, and also maintenance contractors, towards people who use those premises for work. Those premises, and the means of entry and exit, must be, as far as reasonably practicable, safe and without risks to health.\n\n\n=== Duties towards articles used at work ===\nAn \"article for use at work\" is any (s.53(1)):\nPlant designed for use or operation, whether exclusively or not, by persons at work, and\nArticle designed for use as a component in any such plant.\nSection 6(1) defines the duty of any person who designs, manufactures, imports or supplies any article for use at work to:\nEnsure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the article is so designed and constructed that it will be safe and without risks to health at all times when it is being set, used, cleaned or maintained by a person at work;\nPerform such testing and examination as may be necessary to ensure safety;\nTake such steps as are necessary to secure that persons supplied with the article are provided with adequate information about the use for which the article is designed, or has been tested, and about any conditions necessary to ensure that it will be safe and without risks to health at all times, including when it is being dismantled or disposed of; and\nTake such steps as are necessary to secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons are provided with all such revisions of information as are necessary by reason of its becoming known that anything gives rise to a serious risk to health or safety.\nA person may rely on testing done by others so long as it is reasonable for him to do so (s.6(6)). A person may rely on a written undertaking by another person to ensure the safety of an item (s.6(8)) Designers and manufacturers must carry out research to identify and eliminate risks, as far as reasonably practicable (s.6(2)). Erectors and installers have responsibilities to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that an article is so erected and installed that it will be safe and without risks to health at all times when it is being set, used, cleaned or maintained by a person at work (s.6(3)).\nSection 6 was extended by the Consumer Protection Act 1987 to cover fairground equipment and its use by persons at work and enjoyment by members of the public.\n\n\n=== Duties towards substances used at work ===\nSection 6(4) defines the duty of any person who manufactures, imports or supplies any substance for use at work to:\nEnsure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the substance will be safe and without risks to health at all times when it is being used, handled, processed, stored or transported by a person at work or in work premises;\nPerform such testing and examination as may be necessary to ensure safety;\nTake such steps as are necessary to secure that persons supplied with the substance are provided with adequate information about any risks to health or safety to which the inherent properties of the substance may give rise, about the results of any relevant tests which have been carried out on or in connection with the substance, and about any conditions necessary to ensure that the substance will be safe and without risks to health and when the substance is disposed of; and\nTake such steps as are necessary to secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons are provided with all such revisions of information as are necessary by reason of its becoming known that anything gives rise to a serious risk to health or safety.\nSimilar to the regulations concerning articles used at work, a person may also rely on testing or written undertaking by another person to ensure the safety of substances used at work. The duty to identify and eliminate risks of substances rests with manufacturers.\n\n\n=== Exceptions for supply of articles and substances ===\nThe duties only extend to persons in business or acting by way of trade, even though not for profit, and only to matters within their control (s.6(7)). Persons who import into the UK are not relieved of liability for activities such as design and manufacture that took place outside the UK and over which they had control. Finance companies who supply articles or substances by way of hire purchase or credit agreement have no duties under section 6 (s.6(9))..\n\n\n=== Duties of employees ===\nUnder section 7 all employees have a duty while at work to:\nTake reasonable care for the health and safety of him/herself and of other persons who may be affected by his/her acts or omissions at work; and\nCo-operate with employers or other persons so far as is necessary to enable them to perform their duties or requirements under the Act.\n\n\n=== Duties of persons in general ===\nSection 8 requires that \"no person shall intentionally or recklessly interfere with or misuse anything provided in the interests of health, safety or welfare in pursuance of any of the relevant statutory provisions.\"\n\n\n=== Reasonably practicable ===\nWhat is reasonably practicable is a question of fact. The Court of Appeal held in 1949 that:\n\n... in every case, it is the risk that has to be weighed against the measures necessary to eliminate the risk. The greater the risk, no doubt, the less will be the weight to be given to the factor of cost.\n\n\u2014 and:\n\nReasonably practicable is a narrower term than 'physically possible' and seems to me to imply that a computation must be made by the owner in which the quantum of risk is placed on one scale and the sacrifice involved in the measures necessary for averting the risk (whether in money, time or trouble) is placed in the other, and that, if it be shown that there is a gross disproportion between them - the risk being insignificant in relation to the sacrifice - the defendants discharge the onus on them.\n\nWhere a criminal prosecution arises from a breach of duty and the accused's defence is that it would not have been practicable or reasonably practicable to act otherwise, the burden of proof falls on the defendant (s.40). The prosecution have the burden of showing beyond reasonable doubt that certain acts were done or omitted to provide a prima facie case against the accused. Only if the prosecution succeed in this does the defendant have the burden of proving that the alternative was not practicable or reasonable practicable, but only on the balance of probabilities. The Court of Appeal held in 2002 that this requirement was compliant with article 6(2) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as to presumption of innocence. The Court of Appeal noted that the \"reverse burden\" applied to purely regulatory breaches, rather than genuine criminal offences potentially punishable by imprisonment. However, the Health and Safety (Offences) Bill 2007, seeks to extend the sentences available for these offences to include imprisonment for two years. The Department for Work and Pensions has expressed the opinion that, should the Bill become law, it will still be compliant with the ECHR as it \"strikes a fair balance between the fundamental right of the individual and the general interests of the community\".\nIn 2005, the European Commission challenged the defence as noncompliant with Directive 89/391/EEC, which states that (Art.5(1) and (4)):\n\n\"The employer shall have a duty to ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work.\" but that \"This Directive shall not restrict the option of Member States to provide for the exclusion or the limitation of employers\u2019 responsibility where occurrences are due to unusual and unforeseeable circumstances, beyond the employers\u2019 control, or to exceptional events, the consequences of which could not have been avoided despite the exercise of all due care.\"\n\nThe Commission argued that the \"reasonably practicable\" defence was much broader than allowed under the directive but in 2007 the European Court of Justice found for the UK that the defence was in fact compliant.\n\n\n=== Development risks defence ===\nSection 6(10) was added by the Consumer Protection Act 1987 disapplies duties as to articles and substances used at work where a risk \"is shown to be one the occurrence of which could not reasonably be foreseen\". This is known as the development risks defence.\n\n\n== Health and Safety Executive ==\n\nSection 10 created two bodies corporate, the Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive who performed their respective functions on behalf of the Crown (section 10 and Schedule 2). The bodies had wide powers to further their objectives by all means other than borrowing money (ss.11(6), 13). On 1 April 2008, the two bodies merged, the aggregate taking the name Health and Safety Executive.\n\n\n=== Health and Safety Commission ===\n\nBefore its merger with the HSE, the Commission consisted of a chairman and between six and nine other people, appointed by the appropriate Secretary of State, after consultation (section 10(2)-(4)). The Commission's duties were to (section 11(2)):\nassist and encourage persons concerned with matters relevant to the operation of the objectives of the Act;\nmake arrangements for and encourage research and publication, training and information in connection with its work;\nmake arrangements for securing that government departments, employers, employees, their respective representative organisations, and other persons are provided with an information and advisory service and are kept informed of, and adequately advised on, such matters;\npropose regulations.\nThe Commission further had to keep the Secretary of State informed of its plans and ensure alignment with the policies of the Secretary of State, giving effect to any directions given to it (section 11(3)). The Secretary of State could give directions to the Commission (section 12). On 1 April 2006, the Commission ceased to have responsibility for railway safety. The Commission could delegate any of its functions to, or otherwise direct, the Executive (section 11(4)) and could direct the Executive to hold a public inquiry or other investigation into any accident (section 14). However, as of 1 April 2008, all its powers and responsibilities were transferred to the Executive.\n\n\n=== Health and Safety Executive ===\n\nThe Executive consists of a chairman and between 7 and 11 other people, all appointed by the Secretary of State, as of 2008, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Schedule 2). Before the 2008 merger, the Executive had to carry out all functions delegated to it, or otherwise directed by, the Commission and provide the Secretary of State with information and expert advice (section 11(5)). The Executive is responsible for enforcement of the Act and regulations made under it though the Secretary of State may transfer some of the duties to local government (section 18).\n\n\n== Health and safety regulations ==\n\nThe Secretary of State has broad powers to make health and safety regulations (section 15). Breach of regulations can lead to criminal prosecution under section 33. Further, the Health and Safety Executive can issue codes of practice (section 16). Though breach of a code of practice is not in itself a criminal offence it may be evidential towards a criminal breach under the Act (section 17)\n\n\n== Enforcement ==\nBecause individual litigation is unlikely, given that employees may find the regulations complex, the Health and Safety Executive enforces the Act. However, the HSE may also delegate its functions to local government under section 18, which allows for a more decentralised and targeted approach to regulation. Any enforcing authority may appoint inspectors with a written document stating their powers. This is as evidence of their authority (section 19). Enforcing authorities may indemnify the inspector against any civil litigation if he has acted in the honest belief that he was within his powers (section 26). Local government bodies who may be enforcing authorities are:\nEngland:\nCounty Councils where there are no District Councils;\nDistrict Councils;\nLondon Borough Councils;\nCommon Council of the City of London;\nSub-Treasurer of the Inner Temple;\nUnder-Treasurer of the Middle Temple;\nCouncil of the Isles of Scilly;\n\nScotland:\nCouncils for a local government area; and\n\nWales:\nCounty Councils or County Borough Councils.\n\nLocal government bodies can be enforcing authorities in respect of several workplaces and activities including offices, shops, retail and wholesale distribution, hotel and catering establishments, petrol filling stations, residential care homes and the leisure industry. As of 2008, 410 such bodies have responsibility in 1.1 million workplaces. From 1 April 2006 the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) became the enforcing authority for the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and laws made under it, for all health and safety matters relating to the operation of a railway (or tramway).\n\n\n=== Inspectors ===\nUnder section, inspectors have the following powers:\nenter any premises which he has reason to believe it is necessary for him to enter so enforce the Act, at any reasonable time, or in a dangerous situation;\ntake with him a constable if he has reasonable cause to fear any serious obstruction in the execution of his duty;\ntake with him:\nany other person duly authorised by the enforcing authority; and\nany equipment or materials required for any purpose for which the power of entry is being exercised;\n\nmake such examination and investigation as may in any circumstances be necessary for the purpose of enforcing the Act;\ndirect that the premises, or any part of them, or anything therein, shall be left undisturbed, whether generally or in particular respects, for so long as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of any examination or investigation;\ntake such measurements and photographs and make such recordings as he considers necessary for the purpose of examination or investigation;\ntake samples of any articles or substances found, and of the atmosphere in or in the vicinity of the premises;\ncause an article or substance which appears to be a danger to health or safety, to be dismantled or subjected to any process or test, but not so as to damage or destroy it unless this is in the circumstances necessary to enforce the Act;\ntake possession of such an article and detain it for so long as is necessary in order to:\nexamine it and do to it anything which he has power to do;\nensure that it is not tampered with before his examination of it is completed;\nEnsure that it is available for use as evidence in any prosecution or any proceedings relating to a notice under sections 21 or 22;\n\nrequire any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be able to give any information relevant to any examination or investigation to answer (in the absence of persons other than a person nominated by him to be present and any persons whom the inspector may allow to be present) such questions as the inspector thinks fit to ask and to sign a declaration of the truth of his answers;\nrequire the production of, inspect, and take copies of or of any entry in:\nany books or documents which by virtue of any of the relevant statutory provisions are required to be kept; and\nany other books or documents which it is necessary for him to see for the purposes of any examination or investigation;\n\nrequire any person to afford him such facilities and assistance with respect to any matters or things within that person\u2019s control or in relation to which that person has responsibilities as are necessary to enable the inspector to exercise any of the powers conferred on him;\nany other power which is necessary to enforce the Act.\nThe Consumer Protection Act 1987 added the power for a customs officer to seize imported goods for up to 48 hours (section 25A). In observance of the principle of a right to silence, answers given to questions that the inspector required a person to answer cannot be used as evidence against him, nor his spouse or civil partner (section 20(7)), neither can the inspector require production of a document protected by legal professional privilege (section 20(8)).\n\n\n=== Improvement notices ===\nIf an inspector is of the opinion that a person (section 21) is currently contravening the Act; or has contravened the Act in the past in circumstances that make it likely that the contravention will continue or be repeated he may serve him with an improvement notice:\nstating that he believes that the Act is being contravened or will be in the future;\nspecifying the relevant provisions of the Act, giving particulars of the reasons why he is of that opinion; and\nrequiring the person to remedy the contravention within a period, ending not earlier than the period within which an appeal can be brought under section 24, as of 2008, 21 days.\nAppeal against a notice is within 21 days to an employment tribunal who may appoint one or more assessors to sit with them (s.24).\n\n\n=== Prohibition notices ===\nIf an inspector is of the opinion that activities are being carried on, or are likely to be carried on, involving the risk of serious personal injury, he may serve him with a prohibition notice (section 22):\nstating that the inspector is of that opinion;\nspecifying the matters which in his opinion give, or will give rise, to that risk;\nwhere in his opinion any of those matters involves, or will involve a contravention of the Act:\nstating that he is of that opinion;\nspecifying the relevant statutory provisions; and\ngiving particulars of the reasons why he is of that opinion; and\n\ndirecting that the activities shall not be carried on unless the deficiencies have been remedied.\nThe notice may start immediately or at the end of a specified period (section 22(4). Appeal against a notice is within 21 days to an employment tribunal who may appoint one or more assessors to sit with them (section 24).\n\n\n=== Prosecution ===\n\nSection 33(1) creates 15 criminal offences including breach of a duty under the Act or a regulation, contravention of a notice, or obstructing an inspector. In England and Wales prosecution under the Act could originally only be brought by an inspector or with the permission of the Director of Public Prosecutions but the Environment Agency was also authorised on 1 April 1996 (section 38). All offences under the Act are either summary offences or offences triable either way so inspectors start prosecutions by laying an information before the Magistrates' Court. Inspectors can themselves be authorised to exercise rights of audience before the Magistrates even though not legally qualified (section 39).\nIf a person, by some act or omission, causes another person to commit the actus reus of an offence under the Act then they too are guilty of an offence, even if the other person was not prosecuted or could not be prosecuted because they were the Crown (section 36). Where an offence is committed by a body corporate with the consent or connivance, or by the neglect, of a director, manager, secretary or a member acting in a managerial capacity, that individual too is guilty of an offence (section 37).\nWhere a person is convicted under the Act, the court can order that he remedy the state of affairs or can order forfeiture of an item in question (section 42).\n\n\n== Civil liability ==\nThere is no civil liability for breach of statutory duty in respect of sections 2 to 8 but there is liability for breach of health and safety regulations unless the regulations themselves provide otherwise (section 47). However, a breach not actionable in itself may be evidential towards a claim for common law negligence. In particular, a criminal conviction may be given in evidence.\n\n\n== Liability of the Crown ==\nThe Crown is bound by health and safety regulations and by the Act itself save for (section 48):\nNotices (sections 21-25); and\nCriminal offences (sections 33-42);\n\u2014 though an employee of the Crown can be criminally liable (s.48(2)). The Act was extended to the police on 1 July 1998 by the Police (Health and Safety) Act 1997 (section 51A). The Secretary of State may, \"to the extent that it appears to him requisite or expedient to do so in the interests of the safety of the State or the safe custody of persons lawfully detained\" exempt the Crown by Order in Council (section 48(4)). In 1987, the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 was repealed to allow military personnel to sue the Ministry of Defence and bring the Armed Services into line with the Act.\n\n\n== Other provisions ==\nSections 55 to 60 provide for the continued existence of the Employment Medical Advisory Service in England and Wales. Section 68 is an Henry VIII clause enabling the Secretary of State to amend certain provisions of the Act by Statutory Instrument rather than Act of Parliament.\nSections 61 to 76 originally enabled the HSE to create and amend building regulations and gave them other powers over buildings control and approval. These sections were repealed by the Building Act 1984 which replaced them by a general scheme of building regulations.\n\n\n== Territorial extent ==\nThe Act originally applied in England and Wales, Scotland (in part) and Northern Ireland (in part) (section 84). Its provisions were re-enacted for Northern Ireland in 1978 with enforcement made the responsibility of the Health and Safety Agency for Northern Ireland. The Agency's name was changed to the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland in 1998.\nSection 84(3) allowed the Secretary of State to extend, by Order in Council, the provisions outside England, Wales and Scotland. In 1995, the provisions were extended to offshore installations, wells and pipelines in UK territorial waters, mines extending into territorial waters and certain other engineering activities in territorial waters. Activities on a ship under the direction of its master are excluded.\n\n\n== Performance of the act ==\nReviewing performance of the act in 2008 Lord Grocott observed:\n\nBetween 1974 and 2007, the number of fatal injuries to employees fell by 73 per cent; the number of reported non-fatal injuries fell by 70 per cent. Between 1974 and 2007, the rate of injuries per 100,000 employees fell by a huge 76 per cent, and Britain had the lowest rate of fatal injuries in the European Union in 2003, which is the most recent year for which figures are available. The EU average was 2.5 fatalities per 100,000 workers; the figure in the UK was 1.1.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUK labour law\nEnglish tort law\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBooks\nVarious authors, Tolley's Health and Safety at Work Handbook 2008 (Butterworths 2007) ISBN 0-7545-3318-2\nLord Mackay of Clashfern, Halsbury's Laws of England (4th edn 2004) Vol 20, \"Health and Safety at Work\"\nJR Ridley and J Channing, Safety at Work (Butterworth-Heinemann 2003) ISBN 0-7506-5493-7\nJ Stranks, Health and Safety Law (5th edn Prentice Hall 2005) ISBN 0-13-197646-X\nArticles\nRC Simpson, 'Safety and Health at Work: Report of the Robens Committee 1970-72' (1973) 36(2) Modern Law Review 192-198\nW Cullen, The development of safety legislation (Royal Society of Edinburgh 1996)\nHSE, Thirty years on and looking forward: The development and future of the health and safety system in Great Britain (2004)",

            "content": "A sect is a subgroup of a religious, political, or philosophical belief system, usually an offshoot of a larger group. Although the term was originally a classification for religious separated groups, it can now refer to any organization that breaks away from a larger one to follow a different set of rules and principles.\nIn an Indian context, sect refers to an organized tradition.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word sect comes from the Latin noun secta (a feminine form of a variant past participle of the verb sequi, to follow), meaning \"a way, road\", and figuratively a (prescribed) way, mode, or manner, and hence metonymously, a discipline or school of thought as defined by a set of methods and doctrines. The present gamut of meanings of sect has been influenced by confusion with the homonymous (but etymologically unrelated) Latin word secta (the feminine form of the past participle of the verb secare, to cut), as though sects were scissions cast aside from the mainstream religion.\n\n\n== Sociological definitions and descriptions ==\n\nThere are several different sociological definitions and descriptions for the term. Among the first to define them were Max Weber and Ernst Troeltsch (1912). In the church-sect typology they are described as newly formed religious groups that form to protest elements of their parent religion (generally a denomination). Their motivation tends to be situated in accusations of apostasy or heresy in the parent denomination; they are often decrying liberal trends in denominational development and advocating a return to true religion. The American sociologists Rodney Stark and William Sims Bainbridge assert that \"sects claim to be authentic purged, refurbished version of the faith from which they split\". They further assert that sects have, in contrast to churches, a high degree of tension with the surrounding society. Other sociologists of religion such as Fred Kniss have asserted that sectarianism is best described with regard to what a sect is in tension with. Some religious groups exist in tension only with co-religious groups of different ethnicities, or exist in tension with the whole of society rather than the church which the sect originated from.\nSectarianism is sometimes defined in the sociology of religion as a worldview that emphasizes the unique legitimacy of believers' creed and practices and that heightens tension with the larger society by engaging in boundary-maintaining practices.\nThe English sociologist Roy Wallis argues that a sect is characterized by \"epistemological authoritarianism\": sects possess some authoritative locus for the legitimate attribution of heresy. According to Wallis, \"sects lay a claim to possess unique and privileged access to the truth or salvation\" and \"their committed adherents typically regard all those outside the confines of the collectivity as 'in error'\". He contrasts this with a cult that he described as characterized by \"epistemological individualism\" by which he means that \"the cult has no clear locus of final authority beyond the individual member.\"\n\n\n== In other languages ==\nThe corresponding words for \"sect\" in European languages other than English \u2013 Sekte (German), secte (French), secta (Spanish, Catalan, Romanian), seita (Portuguese, Galician), sekta (Polish, Czech, Slovak, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian), sekt (Danish, Estonian, Norwegian, Swedish), sekte (Dutch) and szekta (Hungarian), \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 (Russian, Bulgarian) \u2013 refer to a harmful religious sect and translate into English as \"cult\". In France, since the 1970s, secte has a specific meaning which is very different from the English word.\n\n\n== In Buddhism ==\n\nThe Macmillan Encyclopedia of Religion distinguishes three types of classification of Buddhism, separated into \"Movements\", \"Nik\u0101yas\" and \"Doctrinal schools\":\nSchools:\nTheravada, primarily in South Asia and Southeast Asia.\nMah\u0101y\u0101na, primarily in East Asia.\nVajray\u0101na, primarily in Tibet, Bhutan, Mongolia and the Russian republic of Kalmykia.\n\nNik\u0101yas, or monastic fraternities, three of which survive at the present day:\nTherav\u0101da, in Southeast Asia and South Asia\nDharmaguptaka, in China, Korea and Vietnam\nM\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, in the Tibetan tradition\n\n\n== In Christianity ==\n\nWhile the historical usage of the term \"sect\" in Christendom has had pejorative connotations, referring to a group or movement with heretical beliefs or practices that deviate from those of groups considered orthodox, its primary meaning is to indicate a community which has separated itself in some way from the larger body from which its members came and to which they may or may not still adhere. The term remains valid for this purpose.\n\n\n=== Roman Catholic sects ===\nThere are many groups outside the Roman Catholic Church which regard themselves as Catholic, such as the Community of the Lady of All Nations, the Palmarian Catholic Church, the Neocatechumenal-way , the Philippine Independent Church, the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God and others.\n\n\n== In Hinduism ==\n\nThe Indologist Axel Michaels writes in his book about Hinduism that in an Indian context the word \"sect does not denote a split or excluded community, but rather an organized tradition, usually established by founder with ascetic practices.\" According to Michaels, \"Indian sects do not focus on heresy, since the lack of a center or a compulsory center makes this impossible \u2013 instead, the focus is on adherents and followers.\"\n\n\n== In Islam ==\n\nThe ancient schools of fiqh or sharia in Islam are known as \"madhhabs.\" In the beginning Islam was classically divided into three major sects. These political divisions are well known as Sunni Islam, Shia Islam and Khariji Islam. Each sect developed several distinct jurisprudence systems reflecting their own understanding of the Islamic law during the course of the history of Islam.\nFor instance, Sunnis are separated into five sub-sects, namely, Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, Hanbali and \u1e92\u0101hir\u012b.\nThe Shia, on the other hand, first developed Kaysanism, which in turn divided into three major groupings known as Fivers, Seveners and Twelvers. The Zaydis separated first. The non-Zaydis are initially called as \"Rafida Groups.\" These Rafidis were later divided into two sub-groups known as Imamiyyah and Batiniyyah.\nThe \"Imami-Shi'a\" later brought into existence Ja'fari jurisprudence. Akhbarism, Usulism, and Shaykhism were all ensued as variations of \"Ja'fari fiqh,\" while Alawites and Alevis who are not the strict followers of \"Ja'farism\" are developed separately from the teachings of Ithna'ashari Im\u0101ms.\n\nBatiniyya groups, on the other hand, were divided into two sub-groups known as Seveners and Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs. Qarmatians who did not follow the Fatimid Caliphate were branched from the Seveners. Those groups of Batiniyya who followed the Fatimids are the ancestors of today's Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012bs. Druze was emerged as an offshoot of Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012blism at the beginning of the 11th Century. Isma'ilism at the end of the 11th Century split into two major branches known as Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b (Assassins of Alamut) and Musta\u2019li Ismaili. As a result of the assassination of Fatimid Caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah, Mustaali was once more again divided into Hafizis and Taiyabi Ismailis (Dawoodis, Sulaymanis and Alavis)\nThe Khawarij were initially divided into five major branches: Sufris, Azariqa, Najdat, Adjarites and Ibadis.\nThe Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali Sunnis, the Twelver groups, the Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b groups, the Zaydis, the Ibadis, and the \u1e92\u0101hir\u012bs continue to exist. In addition, new sects like Ahmadiyya movement, Black Muslim movements, Quranists, Salafis, Wahhabis, and Zikris have been emerged independently.\n\n\n=== Amman Message ===\n\nAn Islamic convention held in Jordan in July 2005, which brought 200 Muslim scholars from over 50 countries together, announced the official recognition of eight schools of Islamic jurisprudence and the varying schools of Islamic theology. The eight recognized Islamic schools and branches are:\nSunni Hanafi\nSunni Maliki\nSunni Shafi'i\nSunni Hanbali\nShi'i Im\u0101m\u012b (followers of the Ja'fari jurisprudence)\nShi'i Zaydi\nKhariji Ibadi\nSunni \u1e92\u0101hir\u012b\n\n\n== In Jainism ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nClassifications of religious movements\nCult (religious practice)\nNew religious movement\nOne true church\nReligious exclusivism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChurch sect theory by William H.

            "content": "Kirkstone Pass is a mountain pass in the English Lake District, in the county of Cumbria. It is at an altitude of 1,489 feet (454 m).\n\nThis is the Lake District's highest pass that is open to motor traffic and it connects Ambleside in the Rothay Valley to Patterdale in the Ullswater Valley \u2014 the A592 road. In places, the gradient is 1 in 4. Brothers Water provides a picturesque view on the descent to Patterdale.\nThe Kirkstone Pass Inn stands close to the summit of the pass. Formerly an important coaching inn, it now caters primarily for tourists. It is the third-highest public house in England. The highest is the Tan Hill Inn in North Yorkshire; the second-highest is the Cat and Fiddle Inn in the Peak District.\n\n\n== Slate quarrying ==\nAs well as lead and copper mining, quite a large undertaking of slate mining has been taking place over the years. Petts Quarry, currently being worked by \"Kirkstone Green Slate Company\", is just before the highest point in the pass, from Ambleside. Caudale slate mine is a few miles further down, on the Ullswater side, and was last worked at the beginning of the 20th century. All adits to the mine are now blocked. Nearby is the Hartsop Hall Lead Mine.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the pass is derived from a nearby stone, the Kirkstone, which stands a few yards from the roadside of the A592 leading to Patterdale, several yards from the inn. The stone is so named as its silhouette resembles a church steeple, 'kirk' meaning church in old Norse. It is easily spotted coming either way on the pass. Locally the road from Ambleside up to the Kirkstone Pass Inn is known as The Struggle.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\nIn Cue For Treason, the best-known novel of the children's writer Geoffrey Trease, much of it set in Cumbria, one character adopts the pseudonym \"Kit Kirkstone\", taken from the Kirkstone Pass.\nWitch of the Westmorland by musician Archie Fisher includes the lines \"weary by Ullswater, and the misty brake fern way, down through the cleft of the Kirkstone Pass, the winding water lay\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of hill passes of the Lake District\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Kirkstone Pass at Wikimedia Commons",

The outlets for the products would be ones that traditionally don't stock such products such as gas stations, grocery stores and others not traditionally associated with the products sold. Often the products are of a budget variety.\n\n\n== Etymology of the phrase ==\nRack Jobbing began in the 1930s with the Music Dealers Service with their music sheet racks which they operated. Because the ownership of the products remain the property of the rack jobber, the potential loss incurred by the seller is reduced if nobody buys the product. The proceeds of the sale from the product are then divided/shared by the rack jobber and retailer. Historically, possibly, one of the main products that have been supplied to stores in this fashion are record LPs. Other items that rack jobbers supply have been beauty aids, greeting cards, hardware, paperback books and toys. The display, maintenance and stock rotation of the merchandising are the responsibility of the rack jobber who must periodically come into the store.\n\n\n== Record LPs ==\nThe first LP rack jobber in the U.S. was Elliott Wexler (1913\u20131966) who started Music Merchants in Philadelphia in 1952.\nOne record label whose catalogue was sold via rack jobbers was Sutton, which was founded by Bob Blythe, the former president of Tops Records. In 1963, the label began with 225 records in its catalogue, which was sourced from labels that included Music Craft, Omega and Tiara. Another record label that found its way into the racks was Crown Records, a budget label owned by the Bihari brothers. In the 1960s, one third of record sales were from records sold via rack jobbers. Eventually the rack jobbers moved into more traditional department stores by making arrangements with the retailer in various ways. One of them was asking the retailer to allow a certain amount of sell-space and the rack jobber deciding what goes in the space. Also there could be a verbal guarantee that all of the products would be sold and if not, the next time around, the rack jobber would bring back merchandise that would.\n\n\n== The phrase \"Rack Jobber\" in other languages ==\nRegalgro\u00dfh\u00e4ndler (German)\n\n\n== See also ==\nJobbing house\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Anglo-Saxon charters are documents from the early medieval period in England, which typically made a grant of land, or recorded a privilege. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s: the oldest surviving charters granted land to the Church, but from the eighth century, surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to lay people.\nThe term charter covers a range of written legal documentation including diplomas, writs and wills. A diploma was a royal charter that granted rights over land or other privileges by the king, whereas a writ was an instruction (or prohibition) by the king which may have contained evidence of rights or privileges. Diplomas were usually written on parchment in Latin, but often contained sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The writ was authenticated by a seal and gradually replaced the diploma as evidence of land tenure during the late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods. Land held by virtue of a charter was known as bookland.\nCharters have provided historians with fundamental source material for understanding Anglo-Saxon England, complementing the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and other literary sources. They are catalogued in Peter Sawyer's Annotated List and are usually referred to by their Sawyer number (e.g. S407).\n\n\n== Survival and authenticity ==\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon charter can take many forms: it can be a lease (often presented as a chirograph), a will, an agreement, a writ or, most commonly, a grant of land. Our picture is skewed towards those that regard land, particularly in the earlier period (though it must also be admitted that the emergence of wills and chirorographs also owed much to later development). Land charters can further be subdivided into royal charters, or diplomas, and private charters (donations by figures other than the king).\nOver a thousand Anglo-Saxon charters are extant today, as a result of being maintained in the archives of religious houses. These preserved their charters so as to record their right to land. The oldest extant original charter, now in Canterbury Cathedral archive, was issued in 679 by King Hlothhere of Kent granting land to the Reculver Abbey. Some surviving charters are later copies, which sometimes include interpolations.\nAnglo-Saxon charters were sometimes used in legal disputes, and the recording of the contents of a charter within a legal document has ensured the survival of text when the original charter has been lost. Overall, some two hundred charters exist in the original form, whilst others are post-Conquest copies, that were often made by the compilers of cartularies (collections of title-deeds) or by early modern antiquaries. The earliest cartularies containing copies of Anglo-Saxon charters come from Worcester, early-11th-century Liber Wigorniensis and Hemming's Cartulary of a century later; a much later example, Wilton Cartulary, compiled in the mid-13th century at Wilton Abbey, still includes a significant amount of Anglo-Saxon material.\nThe importance of charters in legal disputes over land as evidence of land tenure, gave rise to numerous charter forgeries, sometimes by those same monastic houses in whose archives they were preserved. The primary motivation for forging charters was to provide evidence of rights to land. Often forging was focussed on providing written evidence for the holdings recorded as belonging to a religious house in the Domesday Book. It is important when studying charters to establish their authenticity. The study of charters to determine authenticity gave rise to diplomatics \u2013 the science of ancient documents.\nAnglo-Saxon charters are catalogued in Peter Sawyer's 'Annotated List', and are usually referred to by their Sawyer number (e.g. S407).\n\n\n== Charter forms ==\n\nThe three most common forms of Anglo-Saxon charter are diplomas, writs and wills.\n\n\n=== Diplomas ===\nThe largest number of surviving charters are diplomas, or royal charters, that granted privileges and rights, usually over land. The typical diploma had three sections: protocol, corpus, and eschatocol. The protocol opened the charter by invoking God and enumerating the pious considerations for the King's act (proem). The corpus was usually in Latin and named the beneficiary, recorded the grant or transfer (dispositive clause), reserved common burdens (reservation clause) and invoked the wrath of God on anyone who failed to observe it (anathema or sanction). The corpus' final section, which was often in Old English, described the boundaries of the land (boundary clause). The eschatocol was composed of a dating clause and witness-list, which usually included powerful lay and ecclesiastical members of the king's court.\nMuch of the language of the diploma was explicitly religious - that a grant was made for the benefit of the grantor's soul or that anyone breaking the charter would be excommunicated. Charters typically opened by situating themselves firmly within the Christian order, with a pictorial (cross, chrismon or alpha-omega) and a verbal invocation to God. Many early charters were granted in anticipation of the founding of a monastery. The document served a largely secular purpose \u2014 to document the legal possession of land and to free that land from certain duties that would otherwise be attached to it.\n\n\n=== Writs ===\n\nThe second most common form of Anglo-Saxon charter, although far fewer in number than the diploma, is the royal writ. These differed from the diploma in both form and function. A writ was an instruction from the king to a named official or group of recipients. It started with a greeting and was authenticated by a royal seal. The writ did not require witnesses and was often written in Old English. Under the Normans, the use of writs was extended to cover many other aspects of royal business and was written in Latin. Florence Harmer provided the text (and translation when written in Old English) of 120 pre-Conquest royal writs.\n\n\n=== Wills ===\n\nAnglo-Saxon wills were intended to make gifts of property (including land) after the writer's death, but they were not wills in the modern sense.\nWills are rarer than writs. The first dedicated study, Anglo-Saxon Wills by Dorothy Whitelock was able to identify 39 documents. The number grew to 55 with publication of another 16 among the Anglo-Saxon Charters by Agnes Jane Robertson in 1939. Since 1939, contributions to the list were few and far between; in her 2011 Wills and Will-making in Anglo-Saxon England Linda Tollerton published the most up-to-date corpus, with 68 examples in total. The surviving documents are very unevenly distributed both in time and space: from the 9th century, for example, only 9 wills are known, and 6 of them are in Canterbury. Not a single will from any period is known from further North than Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire. Furthermore, only 22 wills can be found in manuscripts written before 1066; originals are even rarer, as some, like those of Alfred the Great or Wulfric Spot, are known to be pre-Conquest copies, while still other may in fact be mere extracts or ancient forgeries.\nOnly two wills of kings have been preserved, those of Alfred and Eadred, both in later copies. Anglo-Saxon women whose wills survive include Wynfl\u00e6d (mother of \u00c6lfgifu of Shaftesbury and grandmother of Kings Eadwig and Edgar), King Edmund I's second wife \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and her sister \u00c6lffl\u00e6d.\n\n\n== Boundary descriptions ==\nA typical royal diploma had a clause describing the boundaries of the territory that is the subject of the charter. There are also boundary descriptions in a number of leases and two wills. In the earliest examples, these boundary descriptions are short, in Latin and with few boundary points. In time, the descriptions became longer, more detailed and written in Old English. By the end of the 9th century, all boundary clauses were written in Old English. Many charters, particularly those that have survived in later copies, do not have boundary clauses. In some instances, space has been left for a boundary clause that was never copied. A few boundary descriptions survive that do not appear to be related to any surviving charter.\nThe content of these boundary descriptions varied, but in many instances these descriptions revealed the Anglo-Saxons ideas about their landscape.\n\n\n== Historical significance ==\n\nCharters have provided fundamental source material for understanding Anglo-Saxon England that complements the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and other literary sources. They are often used by historians as sources for the history of Anglo-Saxon England. It was frequently kings who gave land in charters. By seeing what land was awarded, it is possible to see the extent of a king's control and how he exercised his power. In 846, \u00c6thelwulf of Wessex granted land in Devon by charter, perhaps dividing the spoils from this recently conquered territory among his men.\nCharters give lists of persons that attested the document and so it is possible to see who was present at the king's court. The very detailed diplomas drafted by the scribe known as \"\u00c6thelstan A\" show that several Welsh kings, including Hywel Dda, attended the court of \u00c6thelstan in the late 920s and the 930s. A person's absence from court can be equally revealing: Wulfstan I, Archbishop of York from 931 to 956, failed to attest any royal charters between 936 and 941, during which time the Battle of Brunanburh was fought between \u00c6thelstan and an alliance of the Hiberno-Norse king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson and the Scottish king, Constantine. Wulfstan was rather independently-minded and his absence from the West Saxon court can be linked with possible participation at Brunanburh and his later activity as a kind of kingmaker in York. It is also possible to trace a man's career at court through his position in the witness list, as in the case of Eadric Streona at the court of \u00c6thelred 'the Unready' in the early 11th century.\nBurdens that were due by landowners to the king, such as providing soldiers, resources and man-power, were sometimes relieved in charters. This gives historians the opportunity to examine aspects of Anglo-Saxon society.\n\n\n== Published charters ==\nA joint committee of the British Academy and the Royal Historical Society was set up in 1966 to oversee a definitive edition of the entire corpus of Anglo-Saxon charters. The edition is to be published in approximately thirty volumes. The late Professor Nicholas Brooks was chairman of the committee in charge; he has been replaced by Professor Simon Keynes. The following volumes have been published as of 2016:\n1. Charters of Rochester, ed. A. Campbell, 1973\n2. Charters of Burton Abbey, ed. P. H. Sawyer, 1979\n3. Charters of Sherborne, ed. M. A.

            "content": "Samuel Ramos Maga\u00f1a, Ph.D. (1897 \u2013 June 20, 1959), was a Mexican philosopher and writer.\nRamos was born in Zit\u00e1cuaro, Michoac\u00e1n, and in 1909 entered the Colegio de San Nicol\u00e1s in Hidalgo. He published his first works in the school's student publication Flor de Loto. In 1915 he began to study philosophy under the tutelage of his mentor, Jos\u00e9 Torres Orozco.\nHe spent 1915, his first year of medical school in Morelia, and his second and third years at the Military Medical School in Mexico City. In 1919 he became part of the faculty of higher learning and taught introductory philosophy at the National Preparatory School and logic and ethics at the National Teachers School.\nHe pursued specialized degrees at the Sorbonne, the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and a University in Rome. Upon his return to Mexico, he continued to teach and served in the Ministry of Public Education.\nIn 1944 he earned his doctorate in philosophy from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and became head of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature there. On July 8, 1952 he began a lifelong term as a member of the prestigious Colegio Nacional.\n\n\n== Philosophy ==\nHis work concerns itself with the ontology of the Mexican nation. He sees the pelado, the \"urban bum\" of the 1920s and 1930s, as \"the most elemental and clearly defined expression of national character\". The machismo of the pelado, he argues, is the result of an inferiority complex (based on Alfred Adler's concept) and, since the pelado represents the entire country, the \"character study\" is extended to all of Mexico, and was one of the first post-Revolutionary attempts to define and assess the national character.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nFilosof\u00eda de la vida art\u00edstica.

            "content": "Philip Kevin Paulson (1947 \u2013 October 25, 2006) was a U.S. Army combat veteran of the Vietnam War who, as an atheist, was the lead plaintiff in a series of lawsuits to remove a Christian cross from a prominent summit in the city of San Diego. He spent seventeen years, starting with a pro se action against the city, then as lead plaintiff, in multiple successful federal court challenges to remove the 43-foot (13 m) high cross from this government owned land. Although removal was favored by successive court rulings, various tactics, including referendums, appeals and finally removing the underlying land to federal ownership prevented removing the cross. On June 25, 2012, The Supreme Court, by denying certiorari, affirmed an appeals court decision that determined that the cross of Mount Soledad was unconstitutional.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nPaulson grew up in the village of Clayton, Wisconsin, and had two older brothers and two younger sisters. He had been married for a brief period but did not have any children.\n\n\n== Education ==\nPaulson earned a bachelor's degree in Journalism and master's degrees in Public Administration and the Management of Information Systems.\n\n\n== Military service ==\nPaulson enlisted in the U.S. Army aged 18 in 1966, becoming a paratrooper, and served two tours of duty in Vietnam, including on Hill 875 in the Battle of Dak To, where his platoon was ambushed and he and a fellow soldier were the only survivors.\n\n\n== Life after the military ==\nAfter returning from Vietnam, he attended the University of Wisconsin and took a sociology of religion class. Paulson worked in various professions after returning from Vietnam, as a journalist, in shipyards, oil fields, and apple orchards. In the late 1970s, Paulson moved to San Diego and was a professor at National University where he taught business and computing classes.\nIn 2003 he signed the Humanist Manifesto.\n\n\n== Involvement in the Mount Soledad Cross Controversy ==\n\nPaulson spent seventeen years arguing that the cross violated the separation of church and state interpretation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the No Preference Clause of the California Constitution.\nHis detractors, led by the only daily newspaper in the city, The San Diego Union Tribune, depicted him as a man on a mission to deny the expression of the majority's religious preference. In numerous articles and letters to the editor he was invariably referred to as \"Atheist Philip Paulson\u201d, with rarely a mention of his veteran status, having served two combat tours in Viet Nam. Mr. Paulson described his experiences as an atheist in Viet Nam in the article I Was an Atheist in a Foxhole for the American Humanist Association in the September/October 1989 issue of The Humanist magazine.\n\n\n== Death and Union Tribune interview ==\nHe refused interviews and public speaking, except for a single interview with the Union Tribune when he learned that he had terminal liver cancer. Upon his death at the age of 59 on October 25, 2006, the newspaper that had led the attacks against him printed his obituary. It contained this quote, which summarized his motivation:\n\n\u201cI fought in Vietnam and I thought I fought to maintain freedom and yet the cross savers in this city would have us believe all of the veterans' sacrifices are in vain, that the Constitution is something to be spit on,\u201d Mr. Paulson said. \u201cThe real message is equal treatment under the law, and religious neutrality. That's the purpose of why I did it. It has nothing to do with me being an atheist. The fact is, the Constitution calls for no preference and that's why every judge ruled for me.\u201d\n\nWhen it became known that Paulson had only months to live, his friends and supporters organized a luncheon to honor him. Over a hundred people, including national leaders of the movement to preserve separation of church and state, attended. Among the many expressions of appreciation, this one speech on YouTube is available, showing Paulson (hair missing due to chemotherapy) in the audience.\nIn October 2006, the Freedom From Religion Foundation, at its annual convention in San Francisco, gave Paulson its first \"Atheist in a Foxhole\" award. He attended although he was barely able to travel due to his deteriorating health.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLA Times Obituary: Philip Paulson, 59; atheist, Vietnam veteran fought to have hilltop cross removed",

The type species is S. syrticus of late Miocene Africa, which reached roughly 4 m (13.1 ft) in shoulder height. The other unequivocally recognized species is S. orbus, also of late Miocene Africa. Other species outside of Africa are questionably placed in this genus, including teeth from Late Miocene Hungary and Iran originally described as being of the Mastodon subgenus Bunolophodon, Chinese specimens originally described as being also of Mastodon, as well as of Tetralophodon and Stegodon, and a species from the late Miocene-aged Dokh Pathan Formation in Pakistan, S. maluvalensis.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLister, Adrian; Bahn, Paul G.

            "content": "Latton is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north of Cricklade, on the county border with Gloucestershire. The village is bypassed by the A419 road from Swindon to Cirencester. The parish includes the hamlet of Eysey, formerly a village with its own church and parish.\nWatercourses form several of the parish boundaries. In the northeast (also the county boundary) the boundary is the Ampney Brook; in the south, the Thames and its tributary the River Ray; in the northwest the River Churn, another tributary of the Thames.\n\n\n== History ==\nLatton village lies near Ermin Street, the Roman road which ran southeast\u2013northwest from Silchester to the present-day Cirencester and Gloucester.\nThe Domesday Book of 1068 recorded a settlement of some 20 households at Latone, with two mills. Land at Latton and \"Esi\" was held by Reinbald, as recorded in a 1067 writ of William I. Latton and Eisey were granted in 1133 by Henry I to Cirencester Abbey on the abbey's foundation.\nIn 1896 the parish of Eisey (as it was then written) was added to Latton parish, extending it to the east and south and more than doubling its area. In 1984, after the A419 had been straightened to bypass Cricklade, land on the town's side of the road was transferred to Cricklade parish.\n\n\n=== Eysey ===\nThe ancient parish of Eisey or Eysey lay east of Latton. In the middle ages there were settlements at Eisey and Water Eaton, which have both dwindled to farms.\nThere was a small church at Eisey from the 12th century or earlier until its closure in 1948; the church of St Mary that was demolished in 1953 was a rebuilding of 1844. There had been a dependant chapel at Water Eaton, dedicated to St Laurence, from the 12th century or earlier until the 17th. In 1819 a united parish of Latton with Eisey was created.\n\n\n== Church ==\n\nThe present Church of England parish church of St John dates from the 12th century. The lower part of the tower, the tower arch and chancel arch are from that century, and there is a late 12th century south door; the transepts are c. 1300. 19th-century restoration included partial rebuilding by William Butterfield in 1858-63; the nave was restored in 1992.\nThe tower has five bells, four of them dated 1709 and made by the elder Abraham Rudhall. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1955.\nIn 1819, Latton was united with the neighbouring ecclesiastical parish of Eisey. In 1952 Latton was united with two Cricklade parishes, and outlying parts of the former Eisey parish were transferred to its neighbours. Today the parish is part of the Upper Thames benefice.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe Thames and Severn Canal, opened in 1789, passed through the parish, connecting Stroud with the Thames at Lechlade until its closure in 1933. Near the village was a junction with the North Wilts Canal, a branch of the Wilts & Berks Canal which provided a connection to Swindon from 1819 until 1914.\nThe road which followed the route of Ermin Street was designated the A419 in 1922 and became a trunk road in 1946. In 1997, Latton village was bypassed to the west by a new section of the A419.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nGravel extraction began on a small scale in the 16th century, and extensive extraction of sand and gravel from land south-west of Ermin Street was begun in the mid 1990s. Two lakes from these workings form an extension of the Cotswold Water Park. The Co-Operative Wholesale Society had a creamery near Latton from 1935, which employed some 139 people in 1956; it closed in around 1996.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Latton\".

            "content": "Armidale is a city in the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales, Australia. Armidale had a population of 23,352 as at 2016. It is the administrative centre for the Northern Tablelands region. It is approximately halfway between Sydney and Brisbane at the junction of the New England Highway and Waterfall Way. Armidale traditional owners are Anaiwan people. Many Gumbaynggirr people have settled in Armidale since colonisation.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n Armidale is on the banks of Dumaresq Creek, in the Northern Tablelands in the New England region about midway between Sydney and Brisbane at an altitude (980 m AHD) ranging from 970 metres at the valley's floor to 1,110 metres above sea level at the crests of the hills. A short distance to the east of Armidale are heavily forested steep gorges dropping down to the eastern coastal plain. Large parts of the highlands are covered by Palaeozoic aged metamorphosed sedimentary rocks. Intruding into these meta-sediments are granite plutons which decompose to form sandy soil, slightly deficient in nutrients. There are also basalt flows which are more fertile for the soil substrates. Those areas away from the deep gorge country tend to display gently undulating terrain mainly used for pastures and where granites occur the areas are usually covered in bushland.\nThe area contains a number of areas of outstanding natural beauty and scientific interest as well as several World Heritage national parks in the area including the New England National Park and the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park. To the west is Mount Yarrowyck Nature Reserve.\nThe coastal plain can be reached directly at Coffs Harbour via Waterfall Way to Dorrigo and Bellingen on the Bellinger River, a two-hour drive.\n\n\n=== Pollution levels ===\nArmidale has a noted problem with air pollution caused by the use of solid fuel domestic wood heaters during the winter months. A peer-reviewed study carried out by the University of New England found winter woodsmoke causes 8.8 additional visits per day to GPs in Armidale for respiratory complaints, i.e., about 750 additional visits per year. Another peer-reviewed study estimated the use of wood heaters in Armidale was responsible for about 11.5 premature deaths per year with estimated annual health cost of $14.95 million \u2013 about $4720 per year for every woodheater in the city. A local retired doctor (now Associate Professor at the UNE Medical school) said he is so concerned by the wood smoke situation, he urges people with respiratory problems to leave town.\n\n\n== Climate ==\nArmidale has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb) influence. Armidale's elevation gives it a milder climate, but the summers are still very warm. Winters are long and cool, with many frosty nights. Snowfall is extremely rare, on average only one day in every three years.\nThe presence of four distinct seasons, unlike most of the rest of Australia, is the reason for the \"New England\" moniker and the autumn colours are a notable feature of the city. Summers are characterised by warm to very warm days followed almost always by cool, sometimes cold, nights. Thunderstorms often produce heavy falls of rain and occasionally hail in the afternoons and early evenings, also bringing a sudden drop in temperature. Unlike nearby coastal areas, Armidale does not usually experience high humidity levels making most of the summer days quite comfortable. Temperatures exceed 30 \u00b0C on average of 13 days per year, but rarely reach higher than 35 \u00b0C. The highest temperature recorded at Armidale Airport was 37.0 \u00b0C, recorded in January 2014.\nAs the leaves turn yellow and fall, day temperatures are mostly still warm, particularly in March and April. Days are sunny, the thunderstorm season is over, and rain becomes more sporadic. Nights become colder, and residents often awake to a thick fog blanketing the Armidale valley, but by 9 am fogs have cleared to be followed by a bright sunny day. The year's first frosts usually occur in April, but they are not severe.\nWinters are cold; overnight temperatures drop below \u22125 \u00b0C with frost on the ground. These cold frosty mornings are usually followed by sunny days. Day temperatures may make it as high as 16 \u00b0C, but sometimes may not climb beyond 10 \u00b0C. These are typical Northern Tablelands winter days with westerly winds, bleak grey clouds, and showers of rain and very occasionally snow. Rainfalls during the winter months is usually light.\nIn spring temperatures are warmer, although occasional morning frosts still can continue well into October. September is usually a pleasantly mild but windy month, and by late October with increasing heat and humidity the thunderstorm season is starting with increasing rainfalls. The spring months produce the most variable weather of the year. A week of very warm sunny weather can be followed by several milder days with temperatures right back at winter levels before gradually warming up again. This cycle often repeats itself many times until the start of summer.\n\n\n=== Hailstorms ===\n\nArmidale has been prone to severe hailstorms and has experienced three such storms over a period of ten years.\nOn 29 September 1996, hail of up to 80 millimetres (3.1 in) in diameter and southerly winds of up to 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph) were reported at the airport weather station. The area was declared a disaster zone and State Emergency Service crews were brought in from across the state. Damage was estimated to be in excess of A$200 million.\nOn 1 January 2000, many homes were damaged by extreme weather conditions which brought large hail stones, strong winds and flash flooding.\nOn 21 December 2006, hail stones, high winds and flash flooding damaged more than 1,000 homes and destroyed the Armidale Livestock Exhibition Centre which collapsed entirely under the weight of accumulated hail. The city was declared a state of emergency by New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma the following day.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe Armidale railway station is on the Main North railway line and is served by daily passenger trains to and from Sydney. Armidale's airport has five daily scheduled flights to and from Sydney with Qantaslink. Regional airline Fly Corporate operates a scheduled air service with flights to and from Brisbane. Armidale Airport, at 1,084 metres (3,556 ft), is the highest licensed airport in New South Wales.\nThe city is linked further north by daily coach to Tenterfield provided by NSW TrainLink. Other bus companies such as Greyhound also provide numerous daily services. Local city services are provided on six different routes by Edwards Coaches and Armidale is serviced by 16 taxis.\nAlthough the hills to the north and the south can be a challenge, cycling is an option to get around Armidale. A cycleway exists from the University of New England through the city to the residential areas on the eastern side of city. This cycleway snakes back towards Ben Venue School. The passage through the city provides easy access for cyclists to the shopping centres. Bicycle racks are in strategic locations around the city centre, including at The Armidale Food Emporium, The Armidale Plaza, and Centro Armidale. Places are also provided outside the Armidale Dumeresq War Memorial Library, and at either end of the Mall. A maze of marked cycleways on the shoulder of the roads in the city's southern residential areas allows cyclists to safely ride on the roads. There are also separate cycleways from the Armidale Arboretum along Kellys Plains Road to the south and from the north of the city along Rockvale Road to the Armidale State forest (known as the Pine Forest by locals).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBefore the British colonial settlement of New South Wales, the Indigenous An\u0113wan people occupied the area that encompasses current day Armidale.\nArmidale was first settled in the early 1830s, following the earlier exploration of the area by John Oxley. It was named after Armadale on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, the ancestral home of George James McDonald, the Commissioner for Crown Lands in the late 1830s.\nOxley recommended the region for grazing, and soon early pioneers set up small farms in the locality. The James Barnet-designed heritage-listed Armidale Post Office opened on 1 April 1843. The town, which was surveyed in 1848 and gazetted in 1849, was established to provide a market and administration for the farms, but soon after gold was discovered at nearby Rocky River and Gara Gorges, and a gold rush ensued, enlarging the town rapidly in the 1850s. The gold mining settlement of Hillgrove about 40 km east of Armidale was supplied by electricity from Australia's first hydro-electric scheme, remains of which are still visible on the Gara River below the Blue Hole at Castledoyle. The nearby town of Uralla holds the grave of the famous Captain Thunderbolt \u2013 outlaw Fred Ward \u2013 who caused trouble in the area in the 1860s. As with Ned Kelly, the locals have adopted him as a larrikin hero and make the most of him as a tourist attraction.\nArmidale became a municipality in 1863 and was proclaimed a city in 1885.\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Armidale in 1970.\n\n\n== Population ==\nAccording to the 2016 census of Population, there were 23,352 people in the Armidale significant urban area.\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.2% of the population.\n78.3% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 2.0%, China 1.2%, New Zealand 1.1%, India 0.7% and Nepal 0.6%.\n83.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Arabic 1.3%, Mandarin 1.2% and Nepali 0.7%.\nThe most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.1%, Anglican 20.8% and Catholic 20.0%.\n\n\n== City of Armidale ==\n\nArmidale is a cathedral city, being the seat of the Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops of Armidale. St Peter's Anglican Cathedral, which replaced the original St Peter's Church, was designed by the Canadian architect, John Horbury Hunt who also designed Booloominbah at the University of New England. St Peter's Cathedral opened for worship in 1875 and the tower was added in 1938. The Catholic Cathedral of St Mary and St Joseph was dedicated on 12 December 1919.\nThe city centre is laid out in a grid of streets. The main street is called Beardy Street, named for two of the founding settlers who had beards. The court house was built in the 1850s and is still a prominent feature of the central district. Much of the rest of the city is residential.\nThe Australian Wool Fashion Awards, which showcases the use of Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by Armidale in March each year. The Autumn Festival is a popular annual event of April in Armidale. The festival features a street parade, stalls and celebrations throughout the city. It is a regular part of the city's attractions, often promoting Armidale's diverse culture (for instance, posters set up by council attempt to attract tourists with the motto \"Foodies Thrive In Armidale\") and autumn colours. During May the annual New England Wool Expo is staged to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations, shearing competitions, yard dog trials and demonstrations, a wool bale rolling competition and other activities.\n\n\n== Suburbs ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Kanuma, Tochigi, Japan\n Masterton, New Zealand\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe city is home to a large number of education facilities, including the Armidale Waldorf School (1985), New England Girls' School (1895), The Armidale School (1894), and the Presbyterian Ladies' College, Armidale (PLC Armidale) (1887), schools of the Australian independent education sector. O'Connor Catholic College (1975) and St Mary's Primary School are systemic Catholic schools. Duval High School (1972) and Armidale High School (1911) are government-funded secondary schools. Approximately 27% of Armidale's total population is in the 10\u201324 year age group, compared with an equivalent NSW figure of 18&.\n\n\n=== University of New England ===\n\nThe university was founded in 1938, at first as a college of the University of Sydney, but then in its own right in 1954. The UNE contributes to Armidale's position as a city of culture and diversity, with a vibrant artistic and cultural element. The university has strong links to the rural community, and undertakes a lot of agricultural research. There is also a high-technology presence, as well as notable humanities teaching. UNE hosts a wide range of courses, and introduced a number of new courses in 2008, including a five-year Bachelor of Medical Science and Doctor of Medicine program as part of a joint medical program with the University of Newcastle. The university is built around the historic mansion Booloominbah, which is now used for administration and houses a restaurant. UNE is one of the city's main employers.\n\n\n== Retail ==\n\nArmidale is a major regional retail centre, housing three shopping malls:\nCentral Armidale. A A$49 million development anchored by a Woolworths, Big W and 32 speciality stores. It began trading under the name 'Centro' in late November 2007, and was rebranded 'Central' in 2014.\nArmidale Plaza, a A$70 million venture, officially opened an extension, refurbishment and rebranding (formerly Kmart Plaza) in August 2007. Armidale Plaza is anchored by Kmart, Target Country, IGA and 50 specialty stores. Bi-Lo was one of the anchor stores until it closed on 28 February 2010. IGA became an anchor store where it opened there on 8 November 2011.\nThe East Mall was constructed in 2002 and houses Coles Supermarket and 15 speciality stores.\n\n\n=== The Mall ===\n\nArmidale has a pedestrian mall which stretches over three blocks of Beardy Street in the centre of city. It features many shops and caf\u00e9s with outdoor eating areas along with some notable architecture, including Tattersalls Hotel, built in the Art Deco style during the 1930s; Armidale Courthouse; the city's main post office; the former Commonwealth Bank and the New England Hotel. The mall was opened in 1973 and was the first of its kind in regional Australia.\nArmidale Dumaresq Council has been undertaking major upgrades to the mall since 2003 as part of the Armidale CBD Streetscape Design Project which aims at easing traffic in the city centre by creating an emphasis on the \"ring road\" around the CBD with the assistance of signage, elevation of roads using paving and the creation of one-way streets.\n\n\n== Media ==\nThe city is serviced by one local newspaper, many radio stations including four local outlets, and all major television stations.\n\n\n=== Local press ===\nArmidale Express\nArmidale Express Extra\nArmidale Independent, closed November 2014\n\n\n=== Local radio ===\nTUNE!

At the end of the 13th century, the tower was a possession of the powerful Annibaldi family, who were followed by the Prefetti di Vico and by the Caetani, Pope Boniface VIII's family. Under the Caetani the fortified quarter was enlarged and strengthened, probably rivalling with Castel Sant'Angelo as Rome's main fortress.\nAt the end of the 13th century when Henry VII of Luxembourg came to Rome for his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor (May\u2013June 1312), he chose the Torre delle Milizie as the base for his Guelph supporters. Twenty years later the tower was ceded to the Conti. During their ownership, Raphael, in his role as curator of the antiquities of the city, cited the tower as an example of an edifice built re-using antique parts. The Conti held the tower until 1619, when it was acquired by the nuns of the neighbouring convent (later demolished) of Santa Caterina a Magnanapoli.\nIn 1911, the tower was declared an Italian National Monument.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nOne of the main medieval monuments of the city, the Torre delle Milizie is built on a square plan, its base sides measure 10.5 \u00d7 9.5 m. The original height of the tower is uncertain, but following the earthquake of 1348, the top two floors were demolished, reducing the structure to its present height of approximately 50 metres (160 ft). The 1348 earthquake also resulted in the slight tilting of the structure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of leaning towers\nTorre dei Conti\n\n\n== Sources ==\nRendina, Claudio (1999).

            "content": "George Wilder is a prison escaper and New Zealand folk hero. Wilder escaped from prison three times in the 1960s, and his escapades captured the attention of the public.\n\n\n== First escape ==\nWilder was in New Plymouth Prison on 17 May 1962. Part way through a four-year sentence for shopbreaking and theft related to his favourite Jaguar cars, he scaled the 10 metres (33 ft) high wall that day and was not recaptured until 21 July. During those 65 days, he captured the attention of the New Zealand public when newspapers began reporting several hair-raising escapes from the dozens of police tasked with his capture.\nThe stories of Wilder's escapades, included \"wild drives through police barricades, evading large search parties, escaping a police dog by swimming across a river, and getaways by dinghy and horse - all with no hint of violence\". At one stage he is reported to have even joined in a shoulder to shoulder search through rough country for himself, slipping away from his pursuers when the opportunity arose. These exploits seemed to have caught something in the public imagination and Mr Wilder was to a large extent cheered on by large sections of the New Zealand public.\nFinally, he was sighted on 21 July near Whakamaru. A large force of police and soldiers, including three dogs, was mobilised to catch him. Constable Hamilton saw Wilder break from cover and gave chase, but Wilder dashed down a steep bank and disappeared from view. He was found a few hours later, hiding in a hole by a logging road, and taken back to jail.\n\n\n== Second escape ==\nWilder escaped again six months later on 29 January 1963, this time from Mount Eden Prisons in the heart of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. He escaped with three other prisoners by making a rope of sheets and scaling the wall with it. This time, he managed to avoid recapture for 172 days. It was during this period that his folk hero status was firmly established. Wilder would often break into holiday homes or premises and leave apology and thank you notes for the owners. People began leaving food out for him.\nA popular musical group, the Howard Morrison Quartet, penned a hit single called \"George, the Wild(er) New Zealand Boy\" about him, which, despite being banned by New Zealand's state owned broadcasters, went immediately to number 1 in the charts and stayed there for some ten weeks.\nEventually, after evading police for 172 days, George Wilder was captured again on 17 July 1963 in a hut at Rununga Bush, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) off the Napier-Taupo highway. During the time he was at large, he travelled 2,610 kilometres (1,620 mi) and allegedly committed 40 crimes.\n\n\n== Third escape ==\nRestored to life in prison, George Wilder made one more attempt at freedom but this, his final escape, was short lived. In 1965 he escaped with two other prisoners, armed with a sawn-off shotgun. They kidnapped a prison warder at gunpoint and holed up in a house in Mount Eden. After three hours, the trio surrendered to the Armed Offenders Squad and Wilder went back into custody, where he remained until he was paroled in 1969. However, he got into trouble for allegedly stealing rifles and escaped by rowing across the Firth of Thames. He was eventually captured and returned to prison to serve out the remainder of his sentence, which had been extended by his escapes.\nOn 20 June 1969, George Wilder was finally released from prison and moved to the Wairarapa coast, where he still lives as of 2015.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The music of Peru is an amalgamation of sounds and styles drawing on Peru's Andean, Spanish, and African roots. Andean influences can perhaps be best heard in wind instruments and the shape of the melodies, while the African influences can be heard in the rhythm and percussion instruments, and European influences can be heard in the harmonies and stringed instruments. Pre-Columbian Andean on drums and wind instruments, not unlike the European pipe and tabor tradition. Andean tritonic and pentatonic scales were elaborated during the colonial period into\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest printed polyphonic music in Peru, indeed anywhere in the Americas, was \"Hanacpachap cussicuinin,\" composed or collected by Juan P\u00e9rez Bocanegra and printed in 1631.\n\n\n== Instruments ==\n\n\n=== Stringed instruments ===\nPeruvian music is dominated by the national instrument, the charango. The charango is member of the lute family of instruments and was invented during the Viceroyalty of Peru by musicians imitating the Spanish vihuela. In the Canas and Titicaca regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking mermaids with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the Indigenismo movement (1910\u20131940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the walaycho, chillador, chinlili, and the larger and lower-tuned charangon.\nWhile the Spanish guitar is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin bandurria. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere 4 courses. Violins and harps, also of European origin, are also played.\n\n\n=== Percussion instruments ===\nThe caj\u00f3n is an important percussion instrument developed by African slaves. People imply the cowbell may also be of African origin. While the rhythms played on them are often African-influenced, some percussive instruments are of non-African origin. For example, of European origin is the bombo, and of Andean origin are the wankara and tinya respectively.\n\n\n=== Wind instruments ===\nIn addition to the ocarina and waqra phuku, there are Peruvian wind instruments of two basic types, panpipes and flutes, both of Native Andean origin and built to play tritonic, pentatonic and hexatonic scales, though some contemporary musicians play instruments designed to play European diatonic scales. Of the former variety, there are the siku (or zampo\u00f1a) and antara. Of the latter variety, there are the pinkillu, tarka, and quena (qina) flutes.\n\n\n== Dances ==\nSee Peruvian dances\nApiliarg\u2014A dance from the Oporeza area.\nCarnaval en Amazonas\u2014A dance from the Amazonas region similar to the huayno.\nCarnavalito\u2014A dance from southern Peru and the Bolivian Altiplano similar to the huayno.\nChumaichada\u2014A dance from the Amazonas region with strong Native Peruvian musical influences and strong European dance influences.\nCreole Waltz\u2014A Peruvian adaptation of the European waltz.\nCueca\u2014A pan-Andean compound 3/4-6/8 dance rhythm.\nCumbia\u2014A Colombian-in-origin 2/4 dance rhythm.\nDanza de tijeras\u2014A dance from southern Peru.\nDanzantes de Levanto\u2014A dance from the Amazonas region.\nDiablada\u2014A 2/4 dance rhythm from southern Peru, Bolivia, and northern Chile.\nFestejo\u2014A popular 12/8 Afro-Peruvian dance form.\nHarawi (genre) or Yaravi\u2014A highland dance danced to various meters: 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4.\nHuanca (dance)\u2014A dance from the Amazonas region.\nHuay\u00f1o\u2014A popular 2/4 highlands dance.\nKantu\u2014A highland circle dance.\nLand\u00f3\u2014An Afro-Peruvian compound 3/4-12/8 dance rhythm.\nMarinera\u2014An Afro-Peruvian 6/8 dance rhythm.\nPolka\u2014A 2/4 European-in-origin dance form.\nSanjuanito\u2014A 4/4 dance from northern Peru and Ecuador.\nSikuri\nSon de los Diablos\nTondero\u2014A northwestern Peruvian 6/8 dance form.\nZamacueca\u2014A 6/8 Afro-Peruvian dance form.\n\n\n== Notable performers ==\nManuelcha Prado (born 10 June 1955) is a guitarist, singer, composer, compiler and troubadour of Andean music. He is also known for many people as \"The Saqra of the Guitar\".\nJaime Guardia (born 10 February 1933) is a Peruvian singer and charango player. He has performed and recorded as a solo act and with the group Lira Paucina.\nRaul Romero's recordings of saxophone and clarinet ensembles from the Mantaro Valley have proved extremely influential.\nOne important space for Peruvian contemporary classical music is Circomper, the Peruvian Composition Circle.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nM\u00fasica Criolla del Per\u00fa\n(in French) Audio clips: Traditional music of Peru.

            "content": "Miles Gordon Technology, known as MGT, was a small British company, initially specialising in high-quality add-ons for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer. It was founded in June 1986 in Cambridge, England by Alan Miles and Bruce Gordon, former employees of Sinclair Research, after Sinclair sold the rights for the Spectrum to Amstrad. They moved to Swansea, Wales, in May 1989, became a public company in July 1989 and went into receivership in June 1990.\n\n\n== The DISCiPLE and +D ==\nAs the ZX Spectrum became hugely popular, the lack of a mass storage system became a problem for more serious users. While Sinclair's response, the ZX Interface 1 and ZX Microdrive, was very cheap and technologically innovative, it was also rather limited. Many companies developed interfaces to connect floppy disk drives to the ZX Spectrum, one of the most successful being the Opus Discovery; however, these were all to some degree incompatible with Sinclair's system.\nMGT's approach was different. It produced two different floppy-disk interfaces for the Spectrum, first the DISCiPLE (marketed by Rockfort Products) and later the cut-down +D interface (marketed by MGT themselves). Both, however, shared certain features:\nA Shugart-compatible port for connecting one or two floppy diskette drives (the de facto standard created by Shugart Associates)\nA parallel printer port\nA \"magic button\"\nThe latter generated a non-maskable interrupt, freezing any software running on the Spectrum and allowing it to be saved to disk. This made it simple to store tape-based games on disk, to take screenshots and to enter cheat codes. A duplicate expansion connector at the back allowed other peripherals to be daisy chained, although the complexity of the DISCiPLE meant that many would not work correctly.\nHowever, the real innovation was in the ROM. Unlike most of the competing systems, this was compatible with the Sinclair's extended ROM, meaning that the same BASIC commands used to operate Microdrives or the ZX Printer now could control floppy disk drives or a standard parallel printer. As well as being BASIC-compatible, it also mimicked the machine code entry points in the ZX Interface 1 - the so-called \"hook codes\". This meant that any Microdrive-specific software could use floppy disk drives connected to MGT interfaces instead without modification, provided the hook codes were used. The floppy drives simply appeared to Microdrive-aware applications to be very big, fast Microdrives.\nSinclair's Microdrive command syntax was so complex that a selling point of many disk interfaces was that their commands were simpler. While loading from tape required a simple:\n\nLOAD \"progname\"\n\nthe equivalent Microdrive syntax was:\n\nLOAD *\"m\";1;\"progname\"\n\nGiven the complexity of entering punctuation on the Spectrum's tiny keyboard, this was cumbersome. In addition to supporting the Sinclair syntax, MGT's code reduced the command to:\n\nLOAD d1\"progname\"\n\nLater, MGT produced the Lifetime Drive range of floppy disk drives (later named Universal Drive after concerns about warranty expectations). The drive was advertised as being compatible with major systems on the market at the time and comprised four models (3.5\" and 5.25\", with and without their own power supplies). Compatibility with various machines was achieved using a DIP switch and computer-specific cables.\n\n\n== The SAM Coup\u00e9 ==\nMGT started working on their own home computer, the SAM Coup\u00e9, early on, while profits from MGT's other product financed its development. The SAM was essentially a ZX Spectrum 48K-compatible system with enhanced graphics and sound, more interfaces, expanded memory and a new BASIC interpreter. The machine was eventually launched late in 1989. While technically advanced, it arrived too late to establish a market and resulted in the company's demise. The rights to the +D interface were sold to Datel Electronics Limited in an effort to finance the SAM Coup\u00e9. Alan Miles and Bruce Gordon bought the assets of MGT to form Sam Computers. However, that was a temporary reprieve and that company also ceased trading in 1992.\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorld of Spectrum: Hardware Feature #35\nMGT Lifetime/Universal Disc Drive FAQ\nDISCiPLE/+D Technical Guide",

The bill would \"extend through FY2017 the authorization of appropriations for volunteer services for programs conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), community partnership projects for national wildlife refuges, and refuge education programs.\" The bill would authorize the appropriation of $6 million between 2015-2017.\n\n\n== Provisions of the bill ==\nThis summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.\nH.R. 1300 would amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to extend through FY2017 the authorization of appropriations for volunteer services for programs conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), community partnership projects for national wildlife refuges, and refuge education programs.\n\n\n== Congressional Budget office report ==\nThis summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source.\nH.R. 1300 would authorize the appropriation of $6 million over the 2015-2017 period for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to carry out volunteer programs and community partnerships at national wildlife refuges. Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing the legislation would cost $6 million over the 2015-2017 period. Enacting H.R. 1300 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.\n\n\n== Procedural history ==\nH.R. 1300 was introduced into the House on March 20, 2013 by Rep. Jon Runyan (R-NJ). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Natural Resources and the United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs. Subcommittee hearings were held on April 25, 2013. The bill was reported (amended) on June 17, 2013 alongside House Report 113-112. On Friday, July 19, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 1300 would be on the schedule for Monday, July 22, 2013.

            "content": "Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134 (1944), is a United States Supreme Court decision holding that an administrative agency's interpretative rules deserve deference according to their persuasiveness. The court adopted a case-by-case test that considers the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSeven employees of the Swift & Company packing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, brought an action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to recover overtime, liquidated damages, and attorneys' fees, totaling approximately $77,000 (equivalent to $1.07 million in 2017). The employees were required to stay on the packing plant's premises when not on the clock. In the action brought by the employees to recover overtime for the periods they spent on-call, the district court ruled that the time the employees spent waiting to respond to alarms did not constitute hours worked. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision.\nPetitioner sought certiorari review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals affirming the denial of the employees' claim for overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\n\n\n== Issue ==\nThe case examined the deference that was due to the interpretative rules of an administrative agency.\n\n\n== Decision ==\nThe Court decided that no principle of law found either in the Act or in Court decisions precludes waiting time from also being working time. Moreover, the Court did not attempt to lay down a legal formula to resolve similar cases based on their facts. Whether waiting time falls within or without the Act is a question of fact to be resolved by the trial courts. Congress created the office of the Administrator, providing him with responsibilities and empowering him to implement them subject to the act. In pursuit of his duties, the Administrator has gathered considerable experience in the problems of ascertaining working time in employments involving periods of inactivity and knowledge of how to resolve disputes over working time. The Administrator has set forth views of the application of the Act under different circumstances. These views, under Wage and Hour Division Interpretative Bulletin No. 13., provide a guide on how to settle such disputes. As the court states in resolving this particular dispute:\n\nThe Administrator thinks the problems presented by inactive duty require a flexible solution...and his Bulletin endeavors to suggest standards and examples to guide in particular situations\u2026.[In general, the calculation of working time] depends \u2018upon the degree to which the employee is free to engage in personal activities during periods of idleness when he is subject to call and the number of consecutive hours that the employee is subject to call without being required to perform active work.\u2019\n\n\u2026the conclusion of the Administrator is that the general tests which he has suggested point to the exclusion of sleeping and eating time of these employees from the work-week and the inclusion of all other on-call time: although the employees were required to remain on the premises during the entire time, the evidence shows that they were very rarely interrupted in their normal sleeping and eating time, and these are pursuits of a purely private nature which would presumably occupy the employees\u2019 time whether they were on duty or not and which apparently could be pursued adequately and comfortably in the required circumstances; the rest of the time is different because there is nothing in the record to suggest that, even though pleasurably spent, it was spent in the ways the men would have chosen had they been free to do so.\n\nThe court stated that there was no statutory provision as to what deference courts should pay to the Administrator\u2019s guidance. However, the court states that, \u201cwe consider that the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the Administrator under this Act, while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.\u201d\nThe court developed a test to determine the deference to be given to an administrative agency's rules based on the following:\nThe thoroughness of the agency's investigation\nThe validity of its reasoning\nThe consistency of its interpretation over time\nOther persuasive powers of the agency\n\n\n== Subsequent developments ==\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), was a landmark case in which the United States Supreme Court set forth the legal test for determining whether to grant deference to a government agency's interpretation of a statute which it administers. Chevron is the Court's clearest articulation of the doctrine of \"administrative deference,\" to the point that the Court itself has used the phrase \"Chevron deference\" in more recent cases. The Court, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, upheld the EPA's interpretation. A two-part analysis was born from the Chevron decision (called the \"Chevron two-step test\"), where a reviewing court determines: First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter because the court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. If, however, the court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute, but rather determine whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\nChristensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576 (2000) is a Supreme Court of the United States case holding that a county's policy of requiring employees to schedule time off to avoid accruing time off was not prohibited by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Court held that an opinion letter from the Department of Labor, stating that an employer had to get the employee to agree first before it required the employee to schedule time off, did not receive Chevron deference and instead should receive the less deferential standard of Skidmore v. Swift & Co. The majority attempted to draw a bright line between formal agency documents (such as legislative rules) and less formal ones (such as opinion letters). Therefore, the opinion letter of the Department of Labor was not binding on the court. The court went on to state that there is nothing in the FLSA that prohibited the forced use of compensation time. Justice Thomas delivered the 6-3 decision of the court in favor of Harris County and ruled that an agency's interpretation of a statute, announced in more informal agency papers (such as an opinion letter), is entitled to Skidmore deference, not Chevron deference.\nThe continuing vitality of Skidmore deference has been questioned by Justice Scalia, but is still used when agency actions do not carry the force of law. Justice Scalia, in his concurrence in Christensen v. Harris County, argued that Skidmore has no place since Chevron. However, the majority in Christensen held that an agency's interpretation of a statute, announced in more informal agency papers (such as an opinion letter), is entitled to Skidmore deference, not Chevron deference. United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218 (2001) explicitly reaffirms Skidmore, and reiterates deference to agency interpretations that do not have statutory authority resulting from a rule-making process are based on \"the agency's care, its consistency, formality, and relative expertness, and to the persuasiveness of the agency's position.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nSwift and Company v.

            "content": "The Redmond Spokesman is a weekly newspaper published in Redmond, Oregon. The paper serves the city of Redmond and neighboring communities in northern Deschutes County, focusing on local news and events. It has a circulation of about 4,300. The Spokesman was founded in 1910 by Henry H. Palmer. Today, the paper is owned by Western Communications, a publishing company with newspaper holdings in Oregon and California.\n\n\n== Audience ==\nThe Spokesman is weekly newspaper that serves the city of Redmond and northern Deschutes County. The paper is published every Wednesday. It is a community newspaper that primarily covers local area news, sports, business, and events. Most of the paper\u2019s advertising is local as well. As of 2010, The Spokesman had a circulation of approximately 4,300. The paper maintains an online presence through redmondspokesmanonline.com, a web-site that has feature articles, local announcements, a current events calendar, and obituaries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Spokesman is the oldest continuously operated business in the city of Redmond. It was first published on 14 July 1910. The paper\u2019s first publisher was Henry H. Palmer. He had previously published a newspaper in the neighboring town of Tumalo. Palmer operated the newspaper with his wife Clara, who was also an experienced journalist.\nIn September 1911, the Palmers announced that The Spokesman had acquired a new press and paper cutter to improve newspaper printing and production. A typesetting machine was added a short time later. In January 1912, the new 1,200 pound linotype machine was installed to further improve the operation. However, on 26 Feb 1912 a fire started in a neighboring hardware store. The fire spread to adjacent buildings, burning down a grocery store, a bakery, a furniture store, and The Spokesman office. Despite the fact that the loss exceeded their insurance coverage by $4,000, the Palmers were able to keep the newspaper going by using the presses at Redmond\u2019s other newspaper, The Oregon Hub and at The Bulletin in nearby Bend to print The Spokesman while new equipment was ordered.\nAfter several months in temporary quarters, the paper moved into a new stone building on the old office site. When new equipment, including another modern linotype machine, was installed the Palmers began printing The Spokesman in their own production facility again. The sign on top the new office building announcing the home of \"The Redmond Spokesman\" was 3 feet (0.91 m) high and 24 feet (7.3 m) long.\nThe Spokesman was Redmond\u2019s second paper. Its competition was The Oregon Hub, which was founded in 1909. A third community paper, the Redmond Enterprise, began publication in 1913. In 1914, the Palmers bought out the other two newspapers, leaving The Spokesman as Redmond\u2019s only newspaper.\nThe Palmers sold The Spokesman to M.W Pettigrew in 1916. The change in ownership was announced in the 17 February edition of the paper that year. Pettigrew had been in the newspaper business in Kansas, but had moved to central Oregon to become a farmer. He was the publisher and editor of the paper until 1920, when he sold the business to Douglas Mullarky.\nMullarky was an experienced newspaperman, having been a reporter for The Hub and the founder of the short-live Redmond Enterprise. He published The Spokesman until 1922. Mullarky sold the newspaper to W. B. Russell and J. Edger Bloom. Bloom and his wife bought Russell\u2019s share in the newspaper in 1925. The Blooms ran the business until November 1931, when they sold it to Joe and Mary Brown.\nThe Browns owned and published The Spokesman for the next forty years, first as a couple and then Mary alone. Both of the Browns were graduates of the University of Oregon. Under their leadership the paper won the prestigious Hal E. Hoss memorial trophy three times in five years in the mid-1930s. Sponsored by the University of Oregon School of Journalism, the Hoss trophy honored the best weekly newspaper in the state of Oregon. After The Spokesman won it for the third time, the trophy was retired and presented to Joe Brown at a ceremony in Redmond.\nIn 1939, the Browns built a new facility to house their newspaper operation. The building was constructed on two adjoining lots located on 6th Street between C and D streets in downtown Redmond. The new building was one-story, built in the streamline moderne style. It had a 50 feet (15 m) fa\u00e7ade and was 60 feet (18 m) front to back. The building provided office space for the newspaper staff as well housing the print shop.\nIn 1942, Mary Brown was elected president of the Oregon Press Conference while her husband was serving in the United States Navy. In 1955, she became sole owner of The Spokesman. She continued to running the business until 1971.\nIn June 1971, Mary Brown sold The Spokesman to Western Communications, Inc. The first publisher after Western Communications took ownership of the paper was Robert Moody. He stayed until 1975, when Carl Vertrees became publisher. Vertrees ran the paper for twenty-six years, winning the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association\u2019s Carl C. Webb award for long-term public service in 1992. When Vertrees retired in February 2001, Gary Husman moved from general manager to publisher. In 2010, Husman was elected president of the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association.\nIn November 2012 Western Communications laid off a significant portion of the Redmond Spokesman staff and announced they would no longer be reporting \"hard news\" for the Redmond community.\nIt has been reported early 2017 that in recent months Western Communications has experienced difficulty paying employees on their regularly scheduled pay days. This has been positioned by management as a prioritization of funds for other financial obligations. Workers of the Redmond Spokesman and The Bulletin suffer delayed paychecks and direct deposits on regular occurrence in these troubling times for Western Communications.\n\n\n== Western Communications ==\nToday, The Spokesman remains part of Western Communication\u2019s family of publications which includes five other Oregon newspapers and two California papers. Western Communications was founded by publisher Robert W. Chandler. It is headquartered in Bend, Oregon, twenty miles south of Redmond. In addition to The Spokesman, Western Communications publications include:\nBaker City Herald, published in Baker City, Oregon\nThe Bulletin, published in Bend, Oregon\nCentral Oregon Nickel Ads, published in Bend, Oregon\nCurry Coastal Pilot, published in Brookings, Oregon\nThe Observer, published in La Grande, Oregon\nThe Daily Triplicate, published in Crescent City, California\nThe Union Democrat, published in Sonora, California\n\n\n== Publishers ==\nHenry H.

            "content": "David Luchins (born 1946) is a professor at Touro College and chair of its political science department. He is a national vice-president of the Orthodox Union and a national officer of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA). Luchins is a \"much-lauded longtime Orthodox Jewish activist\" who is active in Jewish communal life and is a frequent speaker on educational, political and Jewish topics. Luchins served as an aide to then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey and for 20 years on the Senate staff of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nLuchins was born in New York City, the eldest son of Abraham Luchins, a Gestalt psychologist, and Edith Hirsch Luchins, a mathematician and psychologist, who was one of the first women to serve on the national board of the Orthodox Union. He is a graduate of Yeshiva College, where he studied under Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik in his sophomore year and four years under Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. In 1977, Luchins earned his Ph.D. from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He has been chairman of the political science department at Touro College since 1978, where he teaches courses in American politics and international relations and serves as founding dean of Touro's Lander College for Women.\nLuchins is a frequent speaker at high schools, colleges, synagogues and Jewish communal groups in North America and Israel, lecturing on political and social issues. In summer, he serves as a guest instructor at Aish HaTorah, an Orthodox religious outreach program located in the Old City of Jerusalem. He has been a vice-president of the Orthodox Union since 1976 and a member of the executive committee of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs since 1984. He formerly served on the national commissions of the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Fund for Justice.\nLuchins is married to Vivian Luchins n\u00e9e Osdoby, a graduate of Yeshiva University's Stern College for Women. The couple met as high school students active in the National Conference of Synagogue Youth, the Orthodox Union's youth organization. Now called simply NCSY, the organization honored the Luchins in 2011 for 50 years of service. Vivian Luchins is chair of NCSY summer programs, a senior member of the Orthodox Union's youth commission and a member of the Orthodox Union's national board. The couple lives in the Bronx.\n\n\n== Politically liberal and religiously Orthodox ==\nA longtime political supporter of, and advisor to, Democratic candidates and office-holders, Luchins has also supported and advised Republicans. Writing in The Jewish Daily Forward, Jeffrey Goldberg described Luchins as \"a liberal \u2013 or a 'leftist', as he prefers \u2013 in an Orthodox community that is ever-more conservative [whose] tart tongue has often landed him in the center of controversy.\"\nLuchins served on the 1972 presidential campaign staff of Senator Hubert Humphrey, and subsequently as a national vice chair of Democrats for Nixon. For 20 years, he served on the Senate staff of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, rising from special assistant to senior advisor. He later supported Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato.\nAfter Moynihan's funeral in 2003, at Arlington National Cemetery, Luchins indicated that he would be withdrawing from political activities, saying \"everything I cared about in politics was buried Monday in Arlington Cemetery.\"\nIn 2004, Luchins spoke on behalf of the Orthodox Union about Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Gaza disengagement plan, saying that \"Jews who want to take sides in Israeli politics should make aliya,\" using the Hebrew word for immigration to the State of Israel.\nLuchins has argued that Jewish tradition stands in opposition to fundamentalism. For the 2008 book, Progressive & Religious: How Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist Leaders are Moving Beyond Partisan Politics and Transforming American Public Life, Luchins was asked how it was possible to be \"an Orthodox liberal\". He answered that an Orthodox social conservative \"would be pretty lonely because you don't have too many sources, because the vast part of our religious tradition talks about ... tikkun olam, helping others; it's the number one priority of faith\".\nIn 2009, Luchins offered a reporter writing about elections in New York's ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities example after example of cases where non-Jewish candidates (or non-observant Jewish candidates) who seemed likely to deliver services won out over religiously identified Jewish politicians. \"Constituent services trumps personal biography every single time in the Orthodox Jewish community ... without exception,\" he observed.\nIn a 2013 lecture on \"Gay Marriages Revisited\", delivered at the Israel Center in Jerusalem, Luchins, who considers himself a \"staunch gay rights supporter\", made the point that \"punishment for cheating in business according to the Torah is greater than for the sum total of all the sexual atrocities forbidden by the Torah\". Upholding that gay relationship is forbidden by Jewish law, he adds that \"the fact that the Torah forbids certain behavior does not mean we should demonize, delegitimize or write out of our religion or our humanity those who may fall short, as we all fall short in so many areas... In the area of kindness to every human being, Jew and Gentile, white and black, gay and straight, even Republicans are created in the image of God.\"\n\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2015, Luchins received the Albert D. Chernin Award from the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) at its annual meeting, the 2015 Jewish Community Town Hall, October 10\u201313, in Washington, D.C. The Chernin Award is given to Jewish leaders whose life work best exemplifies the social justice imperatives of Judaism, Jewish history, and the protection of The Bill of Rights.\n\n\n=== Threat of excommunication ===\nIn 1994, Milton Balkany, a conservative Republican active in political fundraising, tried to have Luchins excommunicated by a Jewish religious court, blaming him for having \"caused yeshivas in the land of Israel to lose money\", after Luchins had complained about Balkany's efforts to compel Israeli government officials to use U.S. aid money for projects Balkany favored in Israel. In March 1995, a Rabbinic Court dismissed all charges against Luchins.\nAfter Balkany was charged in February 2010 with trying to extort $4 million from a Connecticut hedge fund to keep information that he said was damaging secret, Luchins expressed surprise and doubt, saying \"while I've had my own run-ins with him in the past, and I'm certainly not a fan of his politics, it's hard to believe someone so intelligent and capable would [d]o something so incredibly stupid. I hope and pray the charges are proven wrong.\" Balkany was later found guilty of all charges.\n\n\n== Chabad Lubavitch ==\n\n\n=== Personal and family relationship ===\nIn a 2009 interview with Chabad Lubavitch News, Luchins affirmed his and his family's personal connection to Chabad Lubavitch and to Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn and Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the sixth and seventh Lubavitcher Rebbes. Luchins has been a guest speaker at Chabad Lubavitch events.\n\n\n=== Lubavitch messianism ===\nIn late June 1996 several Jewish newspapers published a statement signed by Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik opposing attacks on Lubavitcher Hasidim who believed that the late Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, who had died in 1994, was the Messiah. The statement said that the messianists' belief in the role of the rebbe, even after his death, \"cannot be dismissed as a belief that is outside the pale of Orthodoxy\". Lubavitch messianists celebrated the statement and Jews for Jesus released their own announcement, expressing satisfaction with \"the Tzaddik from Chicago\". Luchins, after consulting with Soloveichik, wrote a letter published in the Jewish Daily Forward and the Jewish Week, condemning the way Soloveichik's words were presented, saying that \"using Rabbi Soloveichik in this way is a tremendous disservice to one of the great Torah giants of our generation,\" and adding \"I am certain the Lubavitcher rebbe would be deeply pained by this use of Rabbi Soloveichik's name.\"\n\n\n== The Jonathan Pollard case ==\nLuchins has advocated the release of Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew sentenced to life in prison for spying for Israel; he has also described the pro-Pollard movement a \"cult\", saying that \"Pollard has become a flag of convenience.... He's become a cause that is picked up by other people and used for their own purposes.\"\nIn a March 2007 interview with Susan Rosenbluth of The Jewish Voice and Opinion, Luchins, a student of Rabbi Ahron Soleveichik and a senior advisor to Daniel Patrick Moynahan, described the men's role in trying to free Pollard. According to Luchins, shortly after then-President Bill Clinton 1993 inauguration, he was approached by Moynihan and Senator Joseph Lieberman about Pollard's release; the president was reportedly willing to commute Pollard's sentence and order his release if he wrote a letter expressing clear remorse. Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik brought a letter of apology vetted by the White House to Pollard in prison, for his signature. Reportedly, Pollard signed the letter and Lieberman hand-delivered it to Clinton. However, while the letter was still on Clinton's desk, Pollard is reported to have had a change of heart, renouncing the letter and criticizing a portion that apologized for violating Jewish law. According to Luchins, Pollard was pressured by \"the Pollard people, the more intense members of the cult\", with the result that what seemed like a firm deal to accomplish Pollard's release from prison fell apart. Esther Pollard (Eileen Zeitz) denies that Pollard was ever asked to sign any such letter.\nLuchins' life was threatened by Pollard supporters who circulated a flyer that has been characterized as \"a Salman Rushdie-style religious decree calling for Luchins' murder\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDavid Luchins\u2032 website\nDavid Luchins (April 5, 2003) A Tribute to Senator Moynihan.

            "content": "The Rio 500 is considered the first of the Second Generation MP3 digital audio player (portable digital audio player), and was produced by Diamond Multimedia. It shipped September 22, 1999. The Rio 500 was the successor of the Rio PMP300, and provided a number of user requested features (including USB and higher audio quality). There were many reviews of the Rio 500.  \n\n\n== Features ==\nThe Rio 500 was the first MP3 player to allow file transfer via USB cable, and PC & Mac support. It features 64 MB of flash memory available for music, has light blue backlight, ability to set bookmarks, has an expansion card slot (SmartMedia card) and is powered by one AA battery. It is roughly the size of a standard pack of playing cards. Subsequent firmware updates made better use of the available screen space by displaying additional track information including bitrate.\n\n\n== Non-standard USB ==\nThe Rio 500 has a USB port that looks like the standard 5-pin mini-B type, however it is not compatible with modern USB mini-B cables. The USB1.1 spec was released in September 1998 and the 500 didn't go on sale until a year later, however the spec for mini-B cables and receptacles was not established until October 2000. Before then, some digital cameras had adopted the mini-B connector using a pinout with the data lines reversed (relative to spec) and the +5V line disconnected; the Rio 500 also had adopted the pre-out October 2000 pinout. USB cables that were included with these devices usually had an arrow shape imprinted on the mini connector rather than the USB \"trident\" logo. Any cable used for the Rio 500 must have the +5V line (red wire) cut or it may cause damage when connected with a power source. Replacement Rio Part # 90260017-001 is available on eBay from several vendors.\n\n\n== Software Support ==\nDiamond no longer provides support for the Rio, and the last version of Microsoft Windows to work with Diamond's Rio software was Windows 98/2000. Consequently, owners wanting to keep their Rio working use independently produced freeware programs such as \"Dreaming of Brazil\" or \"RIOsitude\" to upload audio files to the player. Similarly, limited Linux command-line based support for the Rio is provided by the rioutils package.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRio (digital audio players)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRioFXP - Music Transfer Utility for Windows - Last updated in 2002\nRio 500 - Drivers for Linux/*BSD - Last updated in 2002",

            "content": "The dromedary ( or ), also called the Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius), is a large, even-toed ungulate with one hump on its back. The dromedary is the smallest of the three species of camel; adult males stand 1.8\u20132 m (5.9\u20136.6 ft) at the shoulder, while females are 1.7\u20131.9 m (5.6\u20136.2 ft) tall. Males typically weigh between 400 and 600 kg (880 and 1,320 lb), and females weigh between 300 and 540 kg (660 and 1,190 lb). The species' distinctive features include its long, curved neck, narrow chest, a single hump (compared with two on the Bactrian camel and wild Bactrian camel), and long hairs on the throat, shoulders and hump. The coat is generally a shade of brown. The hump, 20 cm (7.9 in) tall or more, is made of fat bound together by fibrous tissue.\nDromedaries are mainly active during daylight hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which are led by a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, such as the ability to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.\nThe dromedary has not occurred naturally in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. It was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the wild, the dromedary inhabited arid regions, including the Sahara Desert. The domesticated dromedary is generally found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World, mainly in Africa, and a significant feral population occurs in Australia. Products of the dromedary, including its meat and milk, support several north Arabian tribes; it is also commonly used for riding and as a beast of burden.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe common name \"dromedary\" comes from the Old French dromedaire or the Late Latin dromedarius. These originated from the Greek word dromas, \u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2 (\u03bf, \u03b7) (GEN (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae) dromados, \u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"running\" or \"runner\", used in Greek in the combination \u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (dromas kamelos), literally \"running camel\", to refer to the dromedary. The first recorded use in English of the name \"dromedary\" occurred in the 14th century. The dromedary possibly originated in Arabia and is therefore sometimes referred to as the Arabian camel. The word \"camel\" generally refers either to the dromedary or the congeneric Bactrian; it may have been derived from the Latin word camelus, the Greek kam\u0113los, or an old Semitic language such as the Hebrew g\u0101m\u0101l or the Arabic \u01e7amal.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and classification ==\nThe dromedary shares the genus Camelus with the Bactrian camel (C. bactrianus) and the wild Bactrian camel (C. ferus). The dromedary belongs to the family Camelidae. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (4th century BC) was the first to describe the species of Camelus. He named two species in his History of Animals; the one-humped Arabian camel and the two-humped Bactrian camel. The dromedary was given its current binomial name Camelus dromedarius by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 publication Systema Naturae. In 1927, British veterinarian Arnold Leese classified dromedaries by their basic habitats; the hill camels are small, muscular animals and efficient beasts of burden; the larger plains camels could be further divided into the desert type that can bear light burdens and are apt for riding, and the riverine type \u2013 slow animals that can bear heavy burdens; and those intermediate between these two types.\nIn 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and colleagues carried out a phylogenetic study of the evolutionary relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini \u2013 consisting of the three Camelus species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) \u2013 and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L. glama) and the vicu\u00f1a (V. vicugna). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.\nThe dromedary and the Bactrian camel often interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Where the ranges of the species overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease as a result of extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their hybrid has given rise to speculation that the dromedary and the Bactrian camel should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.\n\n\n== Genetics and hybrids ==\n\nThe dromedary has 74 diploid chromosomes, the same as other camelids. The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics. The X chromosome is the largest in the metacentric and submetacentric group. There are 31 pairs of acrocentrics. The dromedary's karyotype is similar to that of the Bactrian camel.\nCamel hybridisation began in the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps \u2013 one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents \u2013 they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\nThe extinct Protylopus, which occurred in North America during the upper Eocene, is the oldest and the smallest-known camel. During the transition from Pliocene to Pleistocene, several mammals faced extinction. This period marked the successful radiation of the Camelus species, which migrated over the Bering Strait and dispersed widely into Asia, eastern Europe and Africa. By the Pleistocene, ancestors of the dromedary occurred in the Middle East and northern Africa.\nThe modern dromedary probably evolved in the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was closely related to the earliest Old World camels. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the dromedary foetus has two humps, while in the adult male an anterior vestigial hump is present. A jawbone of a dromedary that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.\nIn 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University wrote that the dromedary exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but did not have to depend upon its products.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\nThe dromedary is the largest camel after the Bactrian camel. Adult males range in height between 1.8 and 2 m (5.9 and 6.6 ft) at the shoulder; females range between 1.7 and 1.9 m (5.6 and 6.2 ft). Males typically weigh between 400 and 600 kg (880 and 1,320 lb); females range between 300 and 540 kg (660 and 1,190 lb). The distinctive features are its long, curved neck, narrow chest and single hump (the Bactrian camel has two), thick, double-layered eyelashes and bushy eyebrows. They have sharp vision and a good sense of smell. The male has a soft palate (dulaa in Arabic) nearly 18 cm (7.1 in) long, which it inflates to produce a deep pink sac. The palate, which is often mistaken for the tongue, dangles from one side of the mouth and is used to attract females during the mating season.\nThe coat is generally brown but can range from black to nearly white. Leese reported piebald dromedaries in Kordofan and Darfur in Sudan. The hair is long and concentrated on the throat, shoulders and the hump. The large eyes are protected by prominent supraorbital ridges; the ears are small and rounded. The hump is at least 20 cm (7.9 in) high. The dromedary has long, powerful legs with two toes on each foot. The feet resemble flat, leathery pads. Like the giraffe, dromedaries moves both legs on one side of the body at the same time.\nCompared with the Bactrian camel, the dromedary has a lighter build, longer limbs, shorter hairs, a harder palate and an insignificant or absent ethmoidal fissure. Unlike the camelids of the genus Lama, the dromedary has a hump, and in comparison has a longer tail, smaller ears, squarer feet and a greater height at the shoulder. The dromedary has four teats instead of the two in the Lama species.\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n\nThe cranium of the dromedary consists of a postorbital bar, a tympanic bulla filled with spongiosa, a well-defined sagittal crest, a long facial part and an indented nasal bone. Typically, there are eight sternal and four non-sternal pairs of ribs. The spinal cord is nearly 214 cm (84 in) long; it terminates in the second and third sacral vertebra. The fibula is reduced to a malleolar bone. The dromedary is a digitigrade animal; it walks on its toes, which are known as digits. It lacks the second and fifth digits. The front feet are 19 cm (7.5 in) wide and 18 cm (7.1 in) long; they are larger than the hind feet, which measure 17 cm (6.7 in) wide and 16 cm (6.3 in) long.\n\nThe dromedary has 22 milk teeth, which are eventually replaced by 34 permanent teeth. The dental formula for permanent dentition is 1.1.3.33.1.2.3, and 1.1.33.1.2 for milk dentition. In the juvenile, the lower first molars develop by 12 to 15 months and the permanent lower incisors appear at 4.5 to 6.5 years of age. All teeth are in use by 8 years. The lenses of the eyes contain crystallin, which constitutes 8 to 13% of the protein present there.\nThe skin is black; the epidermis is 0.038\u20130.064 mm (0.0015\u20130.0025 in) thick and the dermis is 2.2\u20134.7 mm (0.087\u20130.185 in) thick. The hump is composed of fat bound together by fibrous tissue. There are no glands on the face; males have glands that appear to be modified apocrine sweat glands that secrete pungent, coffee-coloured fluid during the rut, located on either side of the neck midline. The glands generally grow heavier during the rut, and range from 20 to 115 g (0.71 to 4.06 oz). Each cover hair is associated with an arrector pilli muscle, a hair follicle, a ring of sebaceous glands and a sweat gland. Females have cone-shaped, four-chambered mammary glands that are 2.4 cm (0.94 in) long with a base diameter of 1.5 cm (0.59 in). These glands can produce milk with up to 90% water content even if the mother is at risk of dehydration.\n\nThe heart weighs around 5 kg (11 lb); it has two ventricles with the tip curving to the left. The pulse rate is 50 beats per minute. The dromedary is the only mammal with oval red blood corpuscles. The pH of the blood varies from 7.1 to 7.6 (slightly alkaline). The individual's state of hydration and sex, and the time of year can influence blood values. The lungs lack lobes. A dehydrated camel has a lower breathing rate. Each kidney has a capacity of 858 cm3 (52.4 cu in), and can produce urine with high chloride concentrations. Like the horse, the dromedary has no gall bladder. The grayish violet, crescent-like spleen weighs less than 500 g (18 oz). The triangular, four-chambered liver weighs 6.5 kg (14 lb); its dimensions are: 60\u00d742\u00d718 cm (23.6\u00d716.5\u00d77.1 in).\n\n\n==== Reproductive system ====\nThe ovaries are reddish, circular and flattened. They are enclosed in a conical bursa and have the dimensions 4\u00d72.5\u00d70.5 cm (1.57\u00d70.98\u00d70.20 in) during anestrus. The oviducts are 25\u201328 cm (9.8\u201311.0 in) long. The uterus is bicornuate. The vagina is 3\u20133.5 cm (1.2\u20131.4 in) long and has well-developed Bartholin's glands. The vulva is 3\u20135 cm (1.2\u20132.0 in) deep and has a small clitoris. The placenta is diffuse and epitheliochorial, with a crescent-like chorion.\nThe penis is covered by a triangular penile sheath that opens backwards; it is about 60 cm (24 in) long. The scrotum is located high in the perineum with the testicles in separate sacs.  Testicles are 7\u201310 cm (2.8\u20133.9 in) long, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 5 cm (2.0 in) wide. The right testicle is often smaller than the left. The typical mass of either testicle is less than 140 g (0.31 lb); during the rut the mass increases from 165 to 253 g (0.364 to 0.558 lb). The Cowper's gland is white, almond-shaped and lacks seminal vesicles; the prostate gland is dark yellow, disc-shaped and divided into two lobes.\n\n\n=== Health and diseases ===\n\nThe dromedary generally suffers from fewer diseases than other domestic livestock such as goats and cattle. Temperature fluctuations occur throughout the day in a healthy dromedary \u2013 the temperature falls to its minimum at dawn, rises until sunset and falls during the night. Nervous camels may vomit if they are carelessly handled; this does not always indicate a disorder. Rutting males may develop nausea.\nThe dromedary is prone to trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by a parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly. The main symptoms are recurring fever, anaemia and weakness; the disease is typically fatal for the camel. Brucellosis is another prominent malady. In an observational study, the seroprevalence of this disease was generally low (2 to 5%) in nomadic or moderately free dromedaries, but it was higher (8 to 15%) in denser populations. Brucellosis is caused by different biotypes of Brucella abortus and B. melitensis. Other internal parasites include Fasciola gigantica (trematode), two types of cestode (tapeworm) and various nematodes (roundworms). Among external parasites, Sarcoptes species cause sarcoptic mange. In a 2000 study in Jordan, 83% of the 32 camels studied tested positive for sarcoptic mange. In another study, dromedaries were found to have natural antibodies against the rinderpest and ovine rinderpest viruses.\nIn 2013, a seroepidemiological study (a study investigating the patterns, causes and effects of a disease on a specific population on the basis of serologic tests) in Egypt was the first to show the dromedary might be a host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A 2013\u201314 study of dromedaries in Saudi Arabia concluded the unusual genetic stability of MERS-CoV coupled with its high seroprevalence in the dromedary makes this camel a highly probable host for the virus. The full genome sequence of MERS-CoV from dromedaries in this study showed a 99.9% match to the genomes of human clade B MERS-CoV. Another study in Saudi Arabia showed the presence of MERS-CoV in 90% of the evaluated dromedaries and suggested that camels could be the animal source of MERS-CoV.\nFleas and ticks are common causes of physical irritation. In a study in Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of salt in the diet.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nThe dromedary is diurnal (active mainly during daylight); free-ranging herds feed and roam throughout the day, though they rest during the hottest hours around noon. The night is mainly spent resting. Dromedaries form cohesive groups of about 20 individuals, which consist of several females led by a dominant male. Females may also lead in turns. Some males either form bachelor groups or roam alone. Herds may congregate to form associations of hundreds of camels during migrations at the time of natural disasters. The males of the herd prevent female members from interacting with bachelor males by standing or walking between them and sometimes driving the bachelor males away. In Australia, short-term home ranges of feral dromedaries cover 50 to 150 km2 (19 to 58 sq mi); annual home ranges can spread over several thousand square kilometres.\nSpecial behavioral features of the dromedary include snapping at others without biting them and showing displeasure by stamping their feet. They are generally non-aggressive, with the exception of rutting males. They appear to remember their homes; females in particular remember the places they first gave birth or suckled their offspring. Males become aggressive in the mating season, and sometimes wrestle. A 1980 study showed androgen levels in males influences their behaviour. Between January and April when these levels are high during the rut, they become difficult to manage, blow out the palate from the mouth, vocalise and throw urine over their backs. Camels scratch parts of their bodies with their legs or with their lower incisors. They may also rub against tree bark and roll in sand.\nFree-ranging dromedaries face large predators typical of their regional distribution, which includes wolves, lions and tigers.\n\n\n=== Diet ===\n\nThe dromedary's diet consists mostly of foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation \u2013 mostly thorny plants. A study said the typical diet of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%). The dromedary is primarily a browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.\nIn the Sahara, 332 plant species have been recorded as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8\u201312 hours per day and ruminate for an equal amount of time.\n\n\n== Biology ==\n\n\n=== Adaptations ===\n\nThe dromedary is specially adapted to its desert habitat; these adaptations are aimed at conserving water and regulating body temperature. The bushy eyebrows and the double row of eyelashes prevent sand and dust from entering the eyes during strong windstorms, and shield them from the sun's glare. The dromedary is able to close its nostrils voluntarily; this assists in water conservation. The dromedary can conserve water by reducing perspiration by fluctuating the body temperature throughout the day from 31 to 41.7 \u00b0C (87.8 to 107.1 \u00b0F). The kidneys are specialised to minimise water loss through excretion. Groups of camels avoid excess heat from the environment by pressing against each other. The dromedary can tolerate greater than 30% water loss, which is generally impossible for other mammals. In temperatures between 30 and 40 \u00b0C (86 and 104 \u00b0F), it needs water every 10 to 15 days. In the hottest temperatures the dromedary takes water every four to seven days. This camel has a quick rate of rehydration and can drink at 10\u201320 L (2.2\u20134.4 imp gal) per minute. The dromedary has a rete mirabile, a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other which uses countercurrent blood flow to cool blood flowing to the brain. This effectively controls the temperature of the brain.\nThe hump stores up to 80 lb (36 kg) of fat, which the camel can break down into water and energy to meet its needs when resources are scarce; the hump also helps dissipate body heat. If the hump is small, the animal can show signs of starvation. In a 2005 study, the mean volume of adipose tissues (in the external part of the hump that have cells to store lipids) is related to the dromedary's unique mechanism of food and water storage. In case of starvation, they can even eat fish and bones, and drink brackish and salty water. The hair is longer on the throat, hump and shoulders. Though the padded hooves effectively support the camel's weight on the ground, they are not suitable for walking on slippery and muddy surfaces.\n\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n\nSince camels have a slow growth rate; they reach sexual maturity only in advanced years. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and depends on the individual, as does the reproductive period. Both sexes might mature by three to five years of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.\nDuring the reproductive season, males splash their urine on their tails and nether regions. To attract females they extrude their soft palate \u2013 a trait unique to the dromedary. As the male gurgles, copious quantities of saliva turns to foam and covers the mouth. Males threaten each other for dominance over the female by trying to stand taller than the other, making low noises and a series of head movements including lowering, lifting and bending their necks backwards. Males tries to defeat other males by biting the opponent's legs and taking the head between his jaws. Copulation begins with foreplay; the male smells the female's genitalia and often bites her there or around her hump. The male forces the female to sit, then grasps her with his forelegs. Camelmen often aid the male insert his penis into the female's vulva. The male dromedary's ability to penetrate the female on his own is disputed, though feral populations in Australia reproduce naturally. Copulation takes from 7 to 35 minutes, averaging 11 to 15 minutes. Normally, three to four ejaculations occur. The semen of a Bikaneri dromedary is white and viscous, with a pH of around 7.8.\nA single calf is born after a gestation period of 15 months. Calves move freely by the end of their first day. Nursing and maternal care continue for one to two years. In a study to find whether young could exist on milk substitutes, two male, month-old camels were separated from their mothers and were fed on milk substitutes prepared commercially for lambs. For the first 30 days, the changes in their weights were marked. Each gained 0.400 kg (0.88 lb) and 1 kg (2.2 lb), respectively, per day. They were found to have grown properly and weighed 135 kg (298 lb) and 145 kg (320 lb) \u2013 normal weights for male calves of that age. Lactational yield can vary with species, breed, individual, region, diet, management conditions and lactating stage. The largest quantity of milk is produced during the early period of lactation. The lactation period can vary between nine and eighteen months.\nDromedaries are induced ovulators. Oestrus may be cued by the nutritional status of the camel and the daylength. If mating does not occur, the follicle, which grows during oestrus, usually regresses within a few days. In one study, 35 complete oestrous cycles were observed in five nonpregnant females over 15 months. The cycles were about 28 days long; follicles matured in six days, maintained their size for 13 days, and returned to their original size in eight days. In another study, ovulation could be best induced when the follicle reaches a size of 0.9\u20131.9 cm (0.35\u20130.75 in). In another study, pregnancy in females could be recognized as early as 40 to 45 days of gestation by the swelling of the left uterine horn, where 99.5% of pregnancies were located.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe dromedary has not occurred in the wild for nearly 2,000 years. Wild dromedaries inhabited arid regions, particularly the Sahara Desert. The original range of the camel's wild ancestors was probably southern Asia and the Arabian peninsula. Its range included hot, arid regions of northern Africa, Ethiopia, the Near East and western and central Asia. The dromedary typically thrives in areas with a long dry season and a short wet season. They are sensitive to cold and humidity, though some breeds can thrive in humid conditions.\nIn the early 21st century, the domesticated dromedary is found in the semi-arid to arid regions of the Old World. Africa has more than 80% of the world's total dromedary population; it occurs in almost every desert zone in the northern part of the continent. The Sahel marks the southern extreme of its range, where the annual rainfall is around 550 mm (22 in). The Horn of Africa has nearly 35% of the world's dromedaries, most of the region's stock is in Somalia, followed by Sudan and Ethiopia (as of the early 2000s). According to the Yearbook of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) for 1984, eastern Africa had about 10 million dromedaries, the largest population of Africa. Western Africa followed with 2.14 million, while northern Africa had nearly 0.76 million. Populations in Africa increased by 16% from 1994 to 2005.\n\nFeral dromedary populations occur in Australia, where it was introduced in 1840. The total dromedary population in Australia is 0.5 million as of 2005. Nearly 99% of the populations are feral, and have annual growth rate of 10%. Most of the Australian feral camels are dromedaries, with only a few Bactrian camels. Most of the dromedaries occur in Western Australia, with smaller populations in the Northern Territory, Western Queensland and northern South Australia.\nIn Asia, nearly 70% of the population occurs in India and Pakistan. The combined population of the dromedary and the Bactrian camel decreased by around 21% between 1994 and 2004. The dromedary is sympatric with the Bactrian camel in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central and southwestern Asia. India has a dromedary population of less than one million, with most (0.67 million) in the state of Rajasthan. Populations in Pakistan decreased from 1.1 million in 1994 to 0.8 million in 2005 \u2013 a 29% decline. According to the FAO, the dromedary population in six countries of the Persian Gulf was nearly 0.67 million in 2003. In the Persian Gulf region the dromedary is locally classified into breeds including Al-Majahem, Al-Hamrah, Al-Safrah, Al-Zarkah and Al-Shakha, based on coat colour. The UAE has three prominent breeds; Racing camel, Al-Arabiat and Al-Kazmiat.\n\n\n=== Domestication ===\n\nThe dromedary was probably first domesticated in Somalia or the Arabian Peninsula about 4,000 years ago. In the ninth or tenth century BC, the dromedary became popular in the Near East. The Persian invasion of Egypt under Cambyses in 525 BC introduced domesticated camels to the area. The Persian camels were not well-suited to trading or travel over the Sahara; journeys across the desert were made on chariots pulled by horses. The dromedary was introduced into Egypt from south-western Asia (Arabia and Persia). The popularity of dromedaries increased after the Islamic conquest of North Africa. While the invasion was accomplished largely on horseback, new links to the Middle East allowed camels to be imported en masse. These camels were well-suited to long desert journeys and could carry a great deal of cargo, allowing substantial trans-Saharan trade for the first time. In Libya, dromedaries were used for transport and their milk and meat constituted the local diet.\nDromedaries were also shipped from south-western Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Canary Islands, the Americas and Australia. Dromedaries were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD. Camels were exported to the Canary Islands in 1405 during the European colonisation of the area, and are still extant there, especially in Lanzarote and to the south of Fuerteventura. Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.\nIn 1840, about six camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, but only one survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the explorer John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.\n\n\n== Relationship with humans ==\nThe strength and docility of the dromedary make it popular as a domesticated animal. According to Richard Bulliet, they can be used for a wide variety of purposes: riding, transport, ploughing, trading and as a source of milk, meat, wool and leather. The main attraction of the dromedary for nomadic desert-dwellers is the wide variety of resources they provide, which are crucial for their survival. It is important for several Bedouin pastoralist tribes of northern Arabia, such as the Ruwallah, the Bani Sakhr and the Mutayr.\n\n\n=== Riding camels ===\n\nAlthough the role of the camel is diminishing with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used in warfare since the 2nd century BC, and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.\nThe ideal riding camel is strong, slender and long-legged with thin, supple skin. The special adaptations of the dromedary's feet allow it to walk with ease on sandy and rough terrain and on cold surfaces. The camels of the Bejas of Sudan and the Anafi camel bred in Sudan are common breeds used as riding camels.\nAccording to Leese, the dromedary walks with four speeds or gaits: walk, jog, fast run and canter. The first is the typical speed of walking, around 4 km/h (2.5 mph). Jog is the most common speed, nearly 8\u201312 km/h (5.0\u20137.5 mph) on level ground. He estimated a speed of 14\u201319 km/h (8.7\u201311.8 mph) during a fast run, by observing northern African and Arabian dromedaries. He gave no speed range to describe the \"canter\", but implied it was a type of gallop that if induced could exhaust the camel and the rider. Canter could be used only for short periods of time, for example in races.\nThe ideal age to start training dromedaries for riding is three years, although they may be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry heavy loads before the age of six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.\n\n\n=== Baggage and draught camels ===\nThe baggage camel should be robust and heavy. Studies have recommended the camel should have either a small or a large head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage from the age of five years, but must not be given heavy loads before the age of six. The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.\nDraught camel are used for several purposes including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It may be used for ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around 2.5 km/h (1.6 mph), and should not be used for more than six hours a day \u2013 four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and hardiness.\n\n\n=== Dairy products ===\n\nCamel milk is a staple food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it consists of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, but it does not compare favourably with sheep milk.\nDaily milk yield generally varies from 3.5 to 35 kg (7.7 to 77.2 lb) and from 1.3% to 7.8% of the body weight. Milk yield varies geographically and depends upon the animals' diet and living conditions. At the peak of lactation, a healthy female would typically provide 9 kg (20 lb) milk per day. Leese estimated a lactating female would yield 4 to 9 L (0.88 to 1.98 imp gal) besides the amount ingested by the calf. The Pakistani dromedary, which is considered a better milker and bigger, can yield 9.1\u201314.1 kg (20\u201331 lb) when well-fed. Dromedaries in Somalia may be milked between two and four times a day, while those in Afar, Ethiopia, may be milked up to seven times a day.\nThe acidity of dromedary milk stored at 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) increases at a slower rate than that of cow milk. Though the preparation of butter from dromedary milk is difficult, it has been carried out successfully in 1959 in the USSR. The cream of the dromedary milk, containing 4.2% fat, yielded 25.8% butter. In 2001, the ability of dromedary milk to form curd was studied; coagulation did not show curd formation, and had a pH of 4.4. It was much different from curd produced from cow milk, and had a fragile, heterogeneous composition probably composed of casein flakes. Nevertheless, cheese and other dairy products can be made from camel milk. A study found bovine calf rennet could be used to coagulate dromedary milk. A special factory has been set up in Nouakchott to pasteurise and make cheese from camel milk. Mystical beliefs surround the use of camel milk in some places; for example, it may be used as an aphrodisiac in Ethiopia.\n\n\n=== Meat ===\n\nThe meat of a five-year-old dromedary has a typical composition of 76% water, 22% protein, 1% fat, and 1% ash. The carcass, weighing 141\u2013310 kg (311\u2013683 lb) for a five-year-old dromedary, is composed of nearly 57% muscle, 26% bone and 17% fat. A seven-to-eight-year-old camel can produce a carcass of 125\u2013400 kg (276\u2013882 lb). The meat is bright red to a dark brown or maroon, while the fat is white. It has the taste and texture of beef. A study of the meat of Iranian dromedaries showed its high glycogen content, which makes it taste sweet like horse meat. The carcasses of well-fed camels were found to be covered with a thin layer of good quality fat. In a study of the fatty acid composition of raw meat taken from the hind legs of seven one-to-three years old males, 51.5% of the fatty acids were saturated, 29.9% mono-unsaturated, and 18.6% polyunsaturated. The major fatty acids in the meat were palmitic acid (26.0%), oleic acid (18.9%) and linoleic acid (12.1%). In the hump, palmitic acid was dominant (34.4%), followed by oleic acid (28.2%), myristic acid (10.3%) and stearic acid (10%).\n\nDromedary slaughter is more difficult than the slaughter of other domestic livestock such as cattle, because of the size of the animal and the significant manual work involved. More males than females are slaughtered. Though less affected by mishandling than other livestock, the pre-slaughter handling of the dromedary plays a crucial role in determining the quality of meat obtained; mishandling can often disfigure the hump. The animal is stunned, seated in a crouching position with the head in a caudal position and slaughtered. The dressing percentage \u2013 the percentage of the mass of the animal that forms the carcass \u2013 is 55\u201370%, more than the 45\u201350% of cattle. Camel meat is rarely consumed by African camel herders, who use it only during severe food scarcity or for rituals. Camel meat is processed into food items such as burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma. Dromedaries can be slaughtered between four and ten years of age. As the animal ages, the meat grows tougher and deteriorates in taste and quality.\nA 2005 report issued jointly by the Ministry of Health (Saudi Arabia) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention details five cases of bubonic plague in humans resulting from the ingestion of raw camel liver. Four of the five patients had severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. Yersinia pestis was isolated from the camel's bone marrow, from the jird (Meriones libycus) and from fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel's corral.\n\n\n=== Camel hair, wool and hides ===\nCamels in hot climates generally do not develop long coats. Camel hair is light, and has low thermal conductivity and durability, and is thus suitable for manufacturing warm clothes, blankets, tents and rugs. Hair of highest quality is typically obtained from juvenile or wild camels. In India, camels are clipped usually in spring and around 1\u20131.5 kg (2.2\u20133.3 lb) hair is produced per clipping. In colder regions one clipping can yield as much as 5.4 kg (12 lb). A dromedary can produce 1 kg (2.2 lb) wool per year, whereas a Bactrian camel has an annual yield of nearly 5\u201312 kg (11\u201326 lb). Dromedaries under the age of two years have a fine undercoat that tends to fall off and should be cropped by hand. Little information about camel hides has been collected but they are usually of inferior quality and are less preferred for manufacturing leather.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCamel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"Camelus dromedarius\".

In other words, uncertainty analysis aims to make a technical contribution to decision-making through the quantification of uncertainties in the relevant variables.\nIn physical experiments uncertainty analysis, or experimental uncertainty assessment, deals with assessing the uncertainty in a measurement. An experiment designed to determine an effect, demonstrate a law, or estimate the numerical value of a physical variable will be affected by errors due to instrumentation, methodology, presence of confounding effects and so on. Experimental uncertainty estimates are needed to assess the confidence in the results. A related field is design of experiments.\nLikewise in numerical experiments and modelling uncertainty analysis draws upon a number of techniques for determining the reliability of model predictions, accounting for various sources of uncertainty in model input and design. A related field is sensitivity analysis.\nA calibrated parameter does not necessarily represent reality, as reality is much more complex. Any prediction has its own complexities of reality that cannot be represented uniquely in the calibrated model; therefore, there is a potential error. Such error must be accounted for when making management decisions on the basis of model outcomes. \n\n\n== See also ==\nInterval finite element method\nUncertainty quantification\nPropagation of uncertainty\nMeasurement uncertainty#Uncertainty evaluation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEtienne de Rocquigny, Nicolas, Devictor, Stefano, Tarantola (Editors), Uncertainty in Industrial Practice: A Guide to Quantitative Uncertainty Management, Wiley & Sons Publishers, 2008.\nJ.C.
