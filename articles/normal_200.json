Miller, who co-founded the town with Henry Barr. It was granted a post office in 1903 and was still open in the 1990s. After the population dropped to 70 in 1970, the population has stayed consistently around 75 since 2000.

            "content": "The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican is an American animated television series that debuted on local stations in Chicago during the 1950s. It is exceedingly rare, but has gained some fame for appearing on Jerry Beck's Worst Cartoons Ever. On the DVD, Beck states that he has not found any evidence that this particular animated adaptation was aired on TV, although there is evidence that the Paddy the Pelican character began in 1950 as a local TV puppet show on Chicago's WENR-TV (now WLS-TV). Paddy's adventures were presented in comic strip drawings done by Sam Singer. This show appeared on the ABC network in the fall of 1951, but for only one month. The show aired on the ABC television network weekdays between 5:15 and 5:30pm from September 11, 1950 to October 13, 1950. Singer had also started producing a newspaper, Paddy Pelican Junior Journal. The animated episodes currently in existence all have copyright dates of 1954.\nThe show is notable and infamous for its shoddy pencil-sketch artwork, reused animation, rambling and apparently improvised voiceovers, muffled and poorly synchronized soundtrack, and general low-budget problems. The only music is a few chords played on an organ, although the title card is accompanied by a man making noises apparently intended to sound like a pelican squawking. All of the characters were voiced by Singer.\nSinger, who worked for Disney and other Hollywood animation studios, also produced a local children's television show, based on the Marshall Field's character \"Uncle Mistletoe\", as well as other early animated shows.\nIn October 2016, all the shorts were uploaded to YouTube. They were taken from their original 16mm and were transferred online.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nHollis, Tim (2001). Hi There, Boys and Girls!

            "content": "Josef Labor (29 June 1842 \u2013 26 April 1924) was an Austrian pianist, organist, and composer of the late Romantic era. Labor was an influential music teacher. As a friend of some key figures in Vienna, his importance was enhanced.\nLabor was born in the town of Ho\u0159ovice in Bohemia to Josef Labor, an administrator of ironworks, and his wife Josefa Wallner, coming from a doctors-family. At the age of three, he was left blind due to contracting smallpox. He attended the Institute for the Blind in Vienna and the Konservatorium der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde (Conservatory of the Society of Friends of Music) where he studied composition with Bruckner\u2019s teacher, Simon Sechter, and piano with Eduard Pickhert.\nHe toured Europe as a pianist and, in the process, formed a lasting friendship with King Georg V of Hanover, who was also blind. Georg named him Royal Chamber Pianist in 1865. The following year, the two men settled in Vienna, where Labor began organ lessons and became a teacher, while continuing to compose and perform.\nIn 1904, Labor received the title Kaiserlich und K\u00f6niglich Hoforganist (Royal and Imperial Court Organist) and is today best known for his organ works. Labor took a serious interest in early music and wrote continuo elaborations for Heinrich Biber\u2019s sonatas.\nLabor taught many notable musical personalities including Alma Schindler (who married Gustav Mahler and others), Paul Wittgenstein and Arnold Schoenberg. Alma Schindler studied with Labor for 6 years, beginning when she was 14, and her diaries contain numerous references to her esteemed teacher.\nLabor was exceedingly close to Paul Wittgenstein's family. He attended many musical evenings at the Wittgenstein home with such Viennese musicians of the day as Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann, Gustav Mahler, Bruno Walter, and Richard Strauss.\nWhen Wittgenstein lost his right arm in World War I, Josef Labor was the first person he asked to write a piece for piano left hand. Wittgenstein later commissioned works for the left hand from other composers including Strauss, Maurice Ravel, Benjamin Britten, Sergei Prokofiev, and Franz Schmidt (the finale of Schmidt's A major Clarinet Quintet - the last of his Wittgenstein commissions - is a set of variations on a theme by Labor from Labor's own clarinet and piano quintet, his opus 11 published in 1901).\nPaul's brother, the philosopher and writer Ludwig Wittgenstein, praised Josef Labor as one of \"the six truly great composers\" along with Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nProgram notes by Bonnie H.

            "content": "The Cook Islands is a Large Ocean State with an Exclusive Economic Zone spanning approximately 2 million km2. It extends from latitude 8\u00b0 to 23\u00b0 South, longitude 156\u00b0 to 167\u00b0 West. The nation is divided into a northern group of six islands and a southern group of nine islands. Three are uninhabited (Suwarrow, Manuae and Takutea). Rarotonga is the most populated island with about 85% of the national population; the outer islands are remote and sparsely populated.\nElectrical power has been provided by generators on each island, but diesel fuel is sourced from Auckland and requires long sea voyages, especially to the northern atolls. Faced with global climate change driven largely by human activities, shipping fuel such long distances no longer seems viable. carbon footprint. The outer islands conserved fuel by turning the power off overnight (11 pm to 6 am), but because Taio shipping is rare they occasionally still ran out of fuel. Rarotonga and Manihiki had 24-hour power.\nNew Zealand Government decided to assist Cook Islands by providing solar power in the northern atolls. The AID programme Uira Natura ko Tokerau (NZ$20 million) was provided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & Trade Construction of the solar arrays was by PowerSmart Solar of New Zealand \nThe first solar site was at Rakahanga, which was completed in September 2014. Pukapuka and Nassau were next, going online at Christmas 2014. Construction began at Tongareva on 23 February 2015 and just 10 weeks later both villages Omoka and Te Tautua were running on solar power. Manihiki was progressed at the same time. In June 2015 all of the northern atolls were fully solar powered. In addition the requirement to send ships north during the cyclone season (November to April) is now reduced.\nThe solar arrays photovoltaic produce 800 volts DC, which is inverted to 230 volts AC and fed to the grid. Power can be inverted again to 48 volts DC to trickle charge the batteries. The system is completed with a small diesel generator that starts automatically.\nConstruction of solar arrays in the Southern Cook Islands is out for tender, and should be funded by the Asian Development Bank; it is expected that Cook Islands will be entirely solar powered by 2020\n\n\n== References ==",

The only road in the area to be named after a European, it commemorates the hugely popular Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, then Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner in 1887 to 1893, who was a Chinese scholar and responsible for most of the work to combat the problems of secret societies.\nAs is common for roads with English names, it has an informal Chinese name, hei yuen kai, meaning Theatre Street in reference to the Lai Chun Yuen Theatre then located at unit 36 and the centre of entertainment in the Kreta Ayer area. The theatre existed sometime in the 1880s and staged Cantonese operas until 1927. With the advent of cinemas, the theatre was converted into a cinema theatre, Sun Seng Cinema, just before World War II, when it was damaged in a bomb attack in 1942.\nIts red-light reputation contributed character to the street, which was also known for hawker stalls crowding into the street during its heyday reputation as the main \"Food Street\". There are attempts to recreate the ambiance today by closing parts of the road and turning it into an outdoor eating area.\nA local joke has it that the road got its English name when the British asked Chinese locals the name of the road, they given clueless answers \"See mee?\" (Hokkien for What?) as they could not understand English. Thus they duly recorded the name as \"Smith\" instead.\n\n\n== References ==\nPeter K G Dunlop (2000) Street Names of Singapore Who's Who Publishing ISBN 981-4062-11-1\nVictor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2003), Toponymics - A Study of Singapore Street Names, Eastern Universities Press, ISBN 981-210-205-1",

His work is characterized by rich hues and strong, textured brushwork.\nBorn in a Jewish family in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), he immigrated with his family to the United States in 1887. In 1889 he began studying painting at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. His teachers included William Merritt Chase, Thomas Anshutz and Cecilia Beaux. Abram Molarsky and his younger brother Maurice Molarsky, who was also a student at the Pennsylvania Academy, went to Paris to continue their artistic studies in 1906. Abram returned to Philadelphia in 1908, where he married artist Sarah Ann Shreve.\nIn 1913, Molarsky had his first solo show at the Doll & Richards Gallery in Boston, where he and his wife had settled. \"Molarsky's color is delicate, refined and harmonious,\" wrote critic William Howe Downes, who had authored books about American painters Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent. After five years in the Boston area, the family moved to Nutley, New Jersey, where Molarsky would spend the rest of his life. Many of the landscapes he painted are scenes of the local parks, woods and fields near Nutley, where he and his wife often worked plein air. During the summers, they often painted in Provincetown, Gloucester and Rockport, Massachusetts. In 1922 a writer for The Boston Evening Transcript visited Molarsky's summer studio in Gloucester and wrote that the paintings had \"a rich and translucent patina of color.\" He described one landscape: \"Delightful to the senses is a little scene from the moors overlooking the harbor, with its fresh notations of color, flight of green, soft distance and rolling clouds.\"\nThroughout his career, Molarsky showed at many galleries and museums, including the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Corcoran Gallery, the National Academy of Design, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Montclair Art Museum and the Newark Museum. In New York, he was represented by the Milch Gallery. In addition to doing his own work, Molarsky taught plein air painting, watercolor and pastel to students in Nutley for many years.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nWho's Who in American Art, 1947.\nWho's Who in American Art, 1953.\nWho Was Who in American Art, 1564-1975.\nThe Artists Bluebook, Lonnie Pierson Dunbier (editor), 2005.\nAnnual Exhibition Record, 1876-1913, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.\nThe Annual Exhibition Record of the Art Institute of Chicago.\nAnnual Exhibition Record, National Academy of Design, 1901-1950.\nBiennial Exhibition Record of the Corcoran Gallery of Art.\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts \u2013 archives on Abram & Maurice Molarsky.\nPennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts \u2013 annual exhibition records for Abram Molarsky.\nAbram (aka Abraham) Molarsky\u2019s 1905 passport application.\nWho\u2019s Who of American Women, 1957 (Sarah Ann Shreve Molarsky).\nThe New York Times, May 11, 1928, \"Out of Town: Art News.\"\nThe New York Times, March 13, 1934, \"National Academy Show opens today.\"\n\n\n== External links ==\nAbram Molarsky on AskArt.com\nAbram Molarsky on ArtNet.com\nAbram Molarsky at the Smithsonian American Art Museum",

            "content": "\"Unity makes strength\" (Dutch: Eendracht maakt macht, pronounced [\u02c8e\u02d0ndr\u0251xt ma\u02d0kt m\u0251xt] ( listen); French: L'union fait la force) is a motto that has been used by various nations and entities throughout history. Currently, it is used by Bulgaria and Haiti on the national coat of arms and is the national motto of Belgium and Bulgaria.\nThe motto was originally used by the Dutch Republic. It was derived from the Latin phrase concordia res parvae crescunt (\"small things flourish by concord\"), used in the Bellum Iugurthinum of Roman Republican writer Sallust.\n\nThe similar moral of the Aesopic fable \"The Old Man and his Sons\" has been rendered in various related ways: \"All power is weak unless united\" (1668), \"Unity makes strength, strife wastes\" (1685), \"Strength lies in union\" (1867), \"Strength is in unity\" (1887), \"Unity is strength\" (title), \"Union gives strength\" (moral) (1894), \"Union is strength\" (1912), \"In unity is strength\" (1919); although older versions are more specific: \"Brotherly love is the greatest good in life and often lifts the humble higher\" (2nd century), \"Just as concord supplies potency in human affairs, so a quarrelsome life deprives people of their strength\" (16th century).\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nThe motto was used by Belgium after its Revolution of 1830, initially only in its French form \"L'union fait la force\". Only when Dutch was made equal in status to French did the Belgian state also take \"Eendracht maakt macht\" as its motto, sometimes with the variant \"Eenheid baart macht\". In 1830, this unity was identified with the unification of Belgium's nine provinces, whose nine provincial coats of arms are represented on the national arms, and the new country's unification of its liberal progressives and Catholic conservatives. Indeed, it was launched in 1827-1828 by newspapers published in Li\u00e8ge which allied liberals and Catholics in the unionism which brought about the Revolution and which then dominated Belgian politics until the founding of the Liberal Party in 1846. Although the motto is often used in Belgicist or unitarist circles (as a call to Flemings and Walloons, natives of Brussels and German speakers, all to maintain Belgium's unity), this is a historical misinterpretation \u2014 the motto is a unionist, not a unitarist, slogan. Its German version is \"Einigkeit macht stark\". Flemings sometimes parody the motto by chanting it as \"L'union fait la farce\" (\"Union makes a farce\") or \"L'oignon fait la farce\" (\"The onion makes the filling\"), trivialising it as a cooking recipe.\n\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n\nFollowing the Bulgarian unification and after Ferdinand of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha took over the throne of the Principality of Bulgaria, the country adopted Belgium's motto of L'union fait la force (in Bulgarian: \u0421\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430). After the king was deposed, it was the country's motto until 1948. After the fall of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the end of Communist rule in the 1990s, the parties debated what should be the country's new coat of arms, deciding on a modified version of its former royal coat of arms. However, the Bulgarian motto also represents the last words of khan Kubrat, the founder of Old Great Bulgaria in 632 AD, and is likely rooted much earlier in Bulgarian symbolics than in other European states.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nAt the second national convention of Acadians in 1884 \"L'union fait la force\" was chosen as the national motto of Acadia and appeared in the coat of arms of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale de l'Acadie in 1995.\n\n\n=== Georgia ===\nDzala ertobashia (Georgian: \u10eb\u10d0\u10da\u10d0 \u10d4\u10e0\u10d7\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0\u10e8\u10d8\u10d0, \"Strength is in Unity\") is the official motto of Georgia.\n\n\n=== Greece ===\nThe phrase is first recorded in Homer as \"Strength in Unity\" (Greek: \"\u1f29 \u1f30\u03c3\u03c7\u03cd\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1fc7 \u1f10\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\").\n\n\n=== Haiti ===\n\nOne of the oldest uses of the term written in the French language, is known since 1807, on Haiti's national coat of arms bearing the motto, \"L'union fait la force\". Although, it should not be confused with the national motto of Haiti, which according to the Constitution of Haiti is \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\"\n\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nAn early design of the coat of arms for the Federation of Malaya (present day Peninsular Malaysia) in used between 1948 and 1963 adopted a variation of the motto, \"Unity is Strength\", rendered in both English and Jawi. Following the admission of three more states into the federation in 1963, the English motto of the arms was replaced by a rough Malay translation, Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu (literally \"Unity Improves Quality\"), while the Jawi motto remained unchanged.\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n\nThe motto was recorded for the first time in the Netherlands in the book Gemeene Duytsche Spreekwoorden (\"Common Dutch Proverbs\") in 1550, whilst the area was still within the Spanish Empire and under the rule of Charles V. After the Dutch gained independence, the new Dutch Republic took over the phrase as its motto and it appeared on several of its coins and coats of arms, usually in the original Latin form, referring to the new state's initially small territorial size. From the late 16th century onwards the start of the motto was frequently used on Dutch coinage, such as the Leicester-rijksdaalder in 1586.\nThe French occupied the Netherlands from 1795 to 1813, first as the Batavian Republic then the Kingdom of Holland then as an annexed part of France itself. Early in the occupation the national motto was changed to \"Gelykheid, Vryheid, Broederschap\" (Equality, Liberty, Fraternity), but from 1802 to 1810 'Unity makes strength' was re-introduced. It remained in use until the institution of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands when, in 1816, it switched to the House of Orange motto 'Je maintiendrai'.\n\n\n=== South African Republic ===\n\nOn 17 January 1852 the United Kingdom, ruler of the Cape Colony, approved the independence of the South African Republic in the Sand River Convention. \"Eendragt maakt magt\" was the motto on the new state's shield and in 1888 it decided it should only use high Dutch (not Afrikaans) as its only official language. Rendered in Latin, the motto of the Union of South Africa from 1910 until 1961 was \"Ex Unitate Vires\" (\"Out of Unity, Strength\"). After 1961, as the Republic of South Africa, the motto was rendered on coins in both Afrikaans (as \"Eendrag maak mag\") and in English (as \"Unity is Strength\"). The motto was changed in 2000 to \"\u01c3ke e: \u01c0xarra \u01c1ke\" which is \"Unity in Diversity\" written in \u01c0Xam.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nThe motto of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City founded by Dutch settlers, is \"Eendraght maeckt maght\". It appears on Brooklyn's seal and flag. Additionally, it is the motto of The Collegiate School, the oldest primary and secondary school in the United States. The motto Eendragt maakt magt also appears on the badge of the police force of Holland, Michigan, combined with God zij met ons (God be with us).\n\n\n== Other uses ==\nEendragt maakt Magt was a noble-society (Heeren-Soci\u00ebteit) founded in Rotterdam in 1830, originally based in the Kralingse Plaslaan. It originally held weekly meetings in the Den Otter coffee house on the corner of the Hoflaan and the Honingerdijk. On 1 May 1865 the Association of Shareholders began fundraising for a private building for the society. This coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, which was one reason the society took the motto of king William II of the Netherlands. The architect Jan Verheul designed the new building and it opened in 1903 on the corner of the Oudedijk and Waterloostraat. In 1980 the building was demolished to make way for the Caland Line metro route, after saving a section of its ornate art nouveau facade (giving the club's name between glazed tiles and leaf patterns) was built into the nearby Voorschoterlaan station.\nThe name was also used as the business name of the tailors \"Eendracht maakt macht\", who in 1910 decided to rent a building on Oranjeboomstraat in Rotterdam, as a joint workshop-office to move their office out of their home. The fine dust from the finished goods caused many to suffer from emphysema and a larger workplace named \"Eendracht maakt macht\" was built.\nThe motto was also used by Helena Blavatsky in her editorials, in response to the internal feuding which often affected the Theosophical Society.\nThe motto of the fascist British government in the Doctor Who serial Inferno, mainly set in an alternate world, was \"Unity is Strength,\" based on the slogan \"Union is Strength\" used by Oswald Mosley's contemporary Union Movement. Similarly, Norsefire, the fascist British government in the 2005 film V for Vendetta uses \"Strength through Unity\" (along with \"Unity through Faith\") as a prominent slogan.\nThe Latin form concordia res parvae crescunt is used by various institutions: the Ateneum in Helsinki, Finland; the former mortgage society in Riga, Latvia (now the Foreign Ministry).\n\n\n== See also ==\nSkilurus, a legendary Scythian king who taught the same moral by instructing his sons to break a bundle of arrows\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Patricia Barry (November 16, 1921 \u2013 October 11, 2016) was an American stage, film, and television actress.\nAlthough Barry has numerous credits performing in stage productions and in films, the majority of her work was in television between 1950 and 2005, when she appeared in over 100 series either in supporting roles or as a guest star.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nThe daughter of a physician, Barry was born Patricia Allen White in Davenport, Iowa. She attended Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, where she received her academic and practical training in acting in the school's drama department, which was administered by the distinguished Broadway actress and teacher Maude Adams. After Barry's graduation from college, she gained some professional experience on stage in 1944 before winning a Rita Hayworth look-alike contest. The resulting publicity from that contest led to Barry being signed to a Hollywood movie contract with Warner Brothers.\n\n\n== Stage ==\nBarry's theatrical debut came in summer theater at Peterborough, New Hampshire. Later appearing on Broadway, her credits there include The Pink Elephant (1953) and Goodbye Again (1956). She also starred in productions in Los Angeles, California, and Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\n\n== Film ==\nBarry's performances in Hollywood productions began in 1946 with her involvement in five Warner Brothers films released that year. However, she received a screen credit\u2013as Patricia White\u2013in only one of those five, in The Beast with Five Fingers. She played \"Clara\" in that horror film, which starred Robert Alda, Andrea King, and Peter Lorre.\nFrom 1947 to 1950, Barry gained additional acting experience in sixteen other movies with Paramount Pictures, Columbia, RKO, and Gene Autry Productions. As before, when credited for her performances in those films, she continued to be recognized by her maiden name, although, following her marriage to producer Philip Barry Jr. in 1950, she began to use her married name professionally. She returned to film work occasionally, including Safe at Home!, Send Me No Flowers, and Dear Heart.\nFollowing those performances, she appeared in a few other theatrical releases in the coming decades, but the vast majority of her work continued to be on television. Some of her other films during that latter stage of her career include The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971), The End of August, (1982), Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), For Keeps (1989), City Rhythms (1989), and Sea of Love (1989). In 2014, just two years before her death and 25 years after her role in Sea of Love, Barry would appear in her final film, Delusional.\n\n\n== Television ==\nFor over 50 years, Barry was a very popular supporting character and guest star on \"the small screen,\" appearing in literally scores of television series and made-for-television movies. Her first role on television was in 1950, in The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse presentation \"The Life of Vincent Van Gogh,\" with Everett Sloane playing the troubled artist. For the remainder of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, she performed in nearly every genre of television programming, including contemporary televised plays, Westerns, situation comedies, doctor and detective series, courtroom dramas, and suspense, adventure, and science-fiction series.\nOften she was cast as high-class, avaricious femme fatales, although she also demonstrated in many series her abilities to perform a wide range of other characters. The following is only a small selection of the television series in which Barry appeared: The Alcoa Hour, Playhouse 90, The Third Man, Yancy Derringer, Sugarfoot, Maverick, The Rifleman, The Millionaire, 77 Sunset Strip, Rawhide, Gunsmoke, The Donna Reed Show, My Three Sons, Bachelor Father, Markham, Laramie, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Going My Way, Thriller, Route 66, Perry Mason, The Twilight Zone, Harris Against the World, The Felony Squad, Judd for the Defense, CBS Playhouse, Ironside, The High Chaparral, and Mannix.\nAs Barry's career extended into the 1970s and beyond the 1990s, she continued her frequent guest roles on an array of more top-rated weekly television series, such as Columbo; Police Woman; Charlie's Angels; Three's Company; Quincy, M.E.; Knots Landing; Dallas; and Murder, She Wrote. Barry in this period also performed in a dozen made-for-television movies and became a recurring character on several major daily daytime dramas or \"soap operas,\" playing Addie Horton Williams on Days of Our Lives (1972-1973), Sally Gleason on Guiding Light (1985-1987), Isabelle Alden on Loving (1992-1994), and Peg English on All My Children (1981-2005). Her performance on the February 28, 2005, episode of All My Children was Barry's last acting appearance broadcast on television.\nDuring her prolific television career, Barry received three Emmy Award nominations for her performances: in 1957 for her role as a dying socialite in \"Dark Victory\" on NBC's Matinee Theater; in 1958 as \"Miss Calhoun\" in Startime's episode \"The Wicked Scheme of Jebal Deeks\"; and in 1959 as \"Lucille\" in Playhouse 90's presentation \"Reunion.\"\n\n\n== Professional and charitable organizations ==\nOutside of her acting career, Barry supported and served in a variety of educational foundations, charities, professional organizations, and women's advocacy groups. She was a charter member and past president of Women in Film (WIF), a Los Angeles-based organization established in 1973 to promote equal opportunities for women in the film industry and later to supporting the work of women not only in films but also \"in all other forms of global media.\" With regard to expanding support for female directors, producers, actors, technicians, and writers, Barry helped to promote the establishment of other WIF chapters throughout the United States and then, in the 1990s, in other countries through the creation of Women in Film and Television International. In addition to her work on behalf of WIF, Barry was the founding president of the American Film Institute Associates and served on boards and committees for Stephens College, the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, the Screen Actors Guild, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, and the John Tracy Clinic, a diagnostic and educational center that provides assistance to children coping with hearing loss.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nPatricia was married for 48 years to Philip Barry, Jr., until his death in 1998. The couple had two daughters, Miranda and Stephanie. On October 11, 2016, Patricia Barry died of natural causes at her home in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 94.\n\n\n== Partial filmography ==\n\nThe Beast with Five Fingers (1946)\nCry Wolf (1947)\nThe Man I Love (1947)\nThe Wreck of the Hesperus (1948)\nRiders of the Whistling Pines (1949)\nThe Undercover Man (1949)\nThe Tattooed Stranger (1950)\nDear Heart (1964)\nKitten with a Whip (1964)\nSend Me No Flowers (1964)\nThe Marriage of a Young Stockbroker (1971)\nTwilight Zone: The Movie (1983)\nSea of Love (1989)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPatricia Barry on IMDb\nPatricia Barry at the TCM Movie Database\nPatricia Barry at the Internet Broadway Database",

The defending champions were Cove Rangers. Brora Rangers were crowned champions for the first time in their history, while Fort William finished last. Brora set new Highland League records by achieving the highest points total and largest margin of victory in the league's history, and their win rate of 31 out of 34 (91.2%) was the highest since Clachnacuddin achieved 11 wins out of 12 (91.7%) in the 1903\u201304 season. In conceding just 16 goals during the season, Brora also beat Peterhead's previous postwar record of 19 conceded in the 1998\u201399 season, and became the first club ever to achieve a positive goal difference in excess of 100.\nThis was the first season in which the Highland League was integrated into the senior pyramid system at level 5, however it was confirmed as per the terms of restructuring that play-offs for a place in the SPFL would commence from 2014\u201315 onwards.\n\n\n== League table ==\n\n\n== Results ==\nUpdated to games played on 16 May 2014.\nSource: highlandfootballleague.com\n1 ^ The home team is listed in the left-hand column.Colours: Blue = home team win; Yellow = draw; Red = away team win.\n\n\n== References ==",

One of his stories, \"The Face in the Sea\", won the 2009 Harper's Pen Award for Sword and Sorcery fiction.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nAccording to Hocking, he wrote his Conan novel Conan and the Emerald Lotus out of dissatisfaction with the Conan novels being published in the early 1990s, \"trying to put into the story all the things I thought were missing from Conan pastiche at that time.\" After taking three years to write it, he was proud enough of the result that he \"didn't want to just drop it into a drawer ....[s]o I sent out a handful of letters, and L. Sprague de Camp responded ...that if I sent him my book he'd look it over. He liked it a lot and LOTUS was published.\" After its success he spent two years writing a second Conan novel, Conan and the Living Plague, under contract with Conan Properties, which was \"sufficiently pleased with the book that they wanted to use it to attract a new publisher for Conan and try to break into hardcover.\" Publication of it and a third Conan novel Hocking had started were canceled due to a change in ownership of Conan Properties.\nHocking has since published a number of fantasy stories, most forming a series featuring the original character Brand the Viking.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Conan series ===\nConan and the Emerald Lotus (1995)\nConan and the Living Plague (unpublished)\n\n\n=== Short stories ===\n\n\n==== Brand the Viking ====\n\"Vali's Wound\" (2004)\n\"The Face in the Sea\" (2009)\n\"The Bonestealer's Mirror\" (2010)\n\n\n==== Other ====\n\"A River Through Darkness and Light\" (2011)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nConan the Barbarian\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn C.

            "content": "Blind Witness is a Canadian deathcore band from Granby, Quebec. Formed in 2005, the group was formerly signed to Mediaskare Records and released two full-length studio albums. The band broke up in 2012, but reformed in 2014.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation, Silence Are Words, Nightmare on Providence St. (2005\u20132010) ===\nBlind Witness was founded in 2005, by vocalist Jonathan Cabana in Granby, Quebec along with friends guitarist Pier-Luc Desroches and drummer Kevin Desroches. They later added guitarist/vocalist Maxime Lacroix and bassist Miguel Lepage to the roster. In 2005, the band began performing in Montreal.\nIn 2007, the band was signed by Victory/Torque Records. In 2007, the band released their first full-length album entitled Silences Are Words.\nWhile writing their follow up album, Blind Witness signed to heavy music label Mediaskare Records and entered the studio to record Nightmare on Providence Street. Released in 2010, the album was met with positive reviews, with Absolute Punk scoring it 84 percent and the reviewer stating that \"metal core is one of the most hated genre's of metal. I believe that Blind Witness can prove that wrong to a lot of different metal fans.\"\n\n\n=== Line-up changes and break up (2011\u20132012) ===\nIn September 2011 it was announced that John Campbell, Maxime Lacroix, Miguel Lepage and Eric Morotti left the band. A few days later Campbell posted on his Facebook: \"The band is not broken up. Myself, Miguel, Max and Eric have quit. The band could very well continue with a new line-up. I'm sure something will be posted soon in regards to the continuation of the band, but for now, 4 of the 5 members have quit, and that's that.\" Cabana had the following to say: \"I'll keep everyone posted soon! We toured a lot and need some time home! I started this band in my basement. I changed a LOT of members through the time! Me and Max are they only original members; Max doesn't want to tour anymore but he still wants to write the new record! Only the people who play live will change, not the music!\" A few months later Eric Morotti rejoined the band, along with new guitarist, Olivier Roy, and bassist Francis Beaupr\u00e9. Lacroix played his last show with the band in October but will continue to write and record the band's next record. Nicolas Doiron has now taken the place as the 2nd guitar player for the band.\nOn February 10, Blind Witness confirmed that they're going into the studio to record their next album in May.\nOn May 25, 2012 Blind Witness announced their break up. They played their last show in Montreal, QC, Canada on August 12 at the Heavy MTL 2012 festival.\n\n\n=== Reformation (2014 onward) ===\nOn July 3, 2014, Blind Witness announced on their Facebook page \"more songs in the making\". In the following months, they confirmed that they would be recording and releasing their next album I Am Hell. Along with releasing artwork and an update video uploaded to YouTube.\n\n\n== Members ==\nCurrent members\nJonathan Cabana \u2013 lead vocals (2005\u20132012, 2014\u2013present)\nMaxime Lacroix \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals (2005\u20132011, 2014\u2013present), studio songwriting (2010-2012)\nEric Morotti \u2013 drums (2009\u20132012, 2014\u2013present)\nOlivier Roy \u2013 guitars (2011\u20132012, 2014\u2013present)\nFrancis \"Frank the Tank\" Beaupre \u2013 bass (2011\u20132012, 2014\u2013present)\nFormer members\n\nTimeline\n\n\n== Discography ==\nStudio albums\nSilences Are Words (Torque Records, 2008)\nNightmare on Providence Street (Mediaskare, 2010)\nEPs\nMeans/Blind Witness - Split EP (Torque Records, 2007)\nI Am Hell (independent, 2015)\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\"Confessions\" (2007)\n\"Bleeding Blades\" (2008)\n\"Baby, One More Notch\" (2010)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBlind Witness at AllMusic\nBlind Witness on Facebook",

Ellis enjoyed utilizing unusual combinations of instruments; the instrumentation on this date consists of five trumpets, three trombones, five saxes, piano, three bassists, two drummers and a percussionist...

            "content": "Complete Failure, also known as \"ComFail\", is a hardcore punk band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America.\n\n\n== History ==\nComplete Failure formed in the summer of 2006 as a collaboration between Pittsburgh-based artists Joe Mack and Mike Rosswog. In late 2007 they signed to Supernova Records, where they recorded Perversions of Guilt, recorded, mixed, and mastered by label owner and Today Is the Day frontman Steve Austin. From March to July 2008 they toured the United States, Canada, and Europe with Today is the Day and others playing over 100 shows.\nIn April 2009 Complete Failure self-recorded and self-released their sophomore full length entitled Heal No Evil. In May 2009 they toured with Relapse Records artists Antigama. Relapse Records then re-released Heal No Evil after the first versions sold out completely.\nIn 2011 drummer Mike Rosswog briefly left the band due to creative differences. James Curl became the primary songwriter and Rosswog contributed drum tracks to albums released thenceforth. The band continued on in this fashion until 2014 when Rosswog left the band permanently to pursue his graphic design work, other musical projects, and start a family.\n\n\n== Influences and Sound ==\nComplete Failure's sound varies from droning hypnotic tribal rhythms to full speed blasting grindcore designed to confuse, disorient, and overwhelm the listener. The band members were brought together by their love of a wide range of underground punk and metal artists including Terrorizer, Napalm Death, Lock Up, Repulsion, His Hero Is Gone, Neurosis, Darkthrone, Mayhem, and others.\n\n\n== Members ==\nJoemack - Vocals\nJames Curl - Bass, Guitars\nMark Bogacki - Bass\n\n\n== Discography ==\nCrossburner \u2013 Season of Mist Records \u2013 to be released October 2017\nThe Art Gospel of Aggravated Assault - Season of Mist Records - Released February 2013\nThe Art Gospel of Aggravated Assault - UNRELEASED - Released 2011-2012\nHeal No Evil - Self Released - Released March 2009\nPerversions of Guilt - Supernova Records (SPNV 16) Released April 2008\nThree calluses of spit and depression (demo) - Self Released - 2007\nPraise the Brainwound (demo) - self-released - 2007 (digital demo)\nGood things happening to bad people - Live from Bern Switzerland (live) - Self-released - 2008\nSupernova Records Sampler 2007 (compilation) - Supernova Records - 2007\nSupernova Records Sampler 2008 (compilation) - Supernova Records - 2008\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Jay Lane (born December 5, 1964) is an American drummer from the San Francisco Bay Area. He is a founding member of Furthur, as well as the Golden Gate Wingmen with John Kadlecik, Jeff Chimenti, and Reed Mathis. Bob Weir's RatDog, Scaring the Children with Weir and Rob Wasserman, Jay's Happy Sunshine Burger Joint, and the hip hop/jazz fusion band Alphabet Soup. He was one of the first drummers of Primus, playing with the band for around eight months in 1988 and later rejoining the band from 2010-2013.\nIn 2002, Lane was named \"drummer of the year\" by the California Music Awards.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLane began learning to play the drums at age nine, and continued to take lessons for 2 years. At sixteen, he took a summer job at a music camp in Cazadero, where he met saxophonist/drummer Dave Ellis and future Spearhead guitarist Dave Shul. In 2014 Jay Joined The Golden Gate Wingmen\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1982, Lane played with Dave Shul in the band Ice Age. In 1983, he joined Bay Area ska punk band The Uptones when their saxophonist left, prompting drummer Dave Ellis to switch instruments. They released an album, K.U.S.A., before Lane left in 1985 to join the Freaky Executives. After four years of gigging the Executives landed a record deal with Warner Bros. Records. It was during this time that Lane met Primus bassist Les Claypool in the bands' shared rehearsal space, and the two became friends as Claypool volunteered to act as a roadie for the Freaky Executives.\nIn 1988, Lane had become so frustrated with Warner's handling of the Executives' contract that when Claypool asked him to recommend a replacement for Primus' recently departed drummer Tim \"Curveball\" Wright, Lane accepted the position himself. Claypool, Lane, and guitarist Todd Huth played together as Primus for about eight months, and recorded a demo tape named Sausage. At the end of 1988, the Freaky Executives' deal looked to be taking a turn for the better, and as Claypool was ready for Primus to start touring, Lane decided he no longer had time for both projects and chose to leave Primus, and also left the Freaky Executives after their record deal was shelved.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the early '90s, Lane began playing in a trio with double bass player Rob Wasserman and Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir, who had previously been playing as a duo for \"six or eight years\" before inviting Lane to join them. In 1992, Lane was reunited with Dave Ellis when he joined jazz combo the Charlie Hunter Trio, and co-founded the hip hop/jazz fusion group Alphabet Soup. The Charlie Hunter Trio released their debut album, Charlie Hunter Trio, in 1993.\nLane later reunited with Claypool and Huth as the band Sausage, named in recognition of the Primus demo they recorded together six years prior. They recorded a single album, 1994's Riddles Are Abound Tonight, followed by a short tour in support of Helmet and Rollins Band. In 1995, Lane released his last album with the Charlie Hunter Trio, Bing, Bing, Bing!, as well as Alphabet Soup's debut, Layin' Low in the Cut, and following the death of Jerry Garcia, the trio of Lane, Weir and Wasserman became the basis for the band RatDog. In 1996, Alphabet Soup released their second album, Strivin', and Lane guested on Claypool's debut solo album Highball with the Devil. In 1997, Lane guested on Christi\u00f3n's debut album, Ghetto Cyrano, playing keyboards.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Lane continued to tour with RatDog, playing hometown shows with Alphabet Soup whenever they had a break in the schedule. In 2000, RatDog released their own debut album, Evening Moods, followed by Live at Roseland in 2001. Also in 2001, Lane appeared once more alongside Claypool and Huth, plus others, on the Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade albums Live Frogs Set 1 and Live Frogs Set 2, the latter of which is a complete performance of Pink Floyd's Animals. In 2002, Lane guested on the Frog Brigade's studio album, Purple Onion, and was named \"drummer of the year\" by the California Music Awards.\nIn 2005, Claypool released his retrospective DVD 5 Gallons of Diesel, featuring many projects that included Lane, and Lane toured with him as part of his Fancy Band. In 2006, many members of Alphabet Soup branched out to form the hip hop/reggae fusion group Band of Brotherz, and Lane joined shortly after. They released their debut album Deadbeats and Murderous Melodys in 2009, featuring covers of Grateful Dead songs, supported by a tour of the East Coast of the United States and a number of dates nationwide with special guests, including the trio of Lane, Weir and Wasserman reunited under the name Scaring the Children. At the end of 2009, Weir put RatDog on hiatus in order to dedicate his time to forming the supergroup Furthur with Phil Lesh, and Lane joined them as a charter member.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2010, Lane left both Furthur and Band of Brotherz to rejoin Primus with Claypool and long-standing guitarist Larry LaLonde, and they released the free June 2010 Rehearsal digital EP, followed in 2011 by a new album, titled Green Naugahyde. As of 2012, Lane's official site still credited him as an active member of RatDog despite the hiatus, as well as Alphabet Soup, and Scaring the Children. In September 2013, it was revealed that Lane had left Primus to rejoin RatDog, who were ending their hiatus. In 2014 Jay Joined The Golden Gate Wingmen. They are a jam band formed in November 2014, featuring Jeff Chimenti, John Kadlecik from Dark Star Orchestra & Reed Mathis from Tea Leaf Green. They record every show and release them to download.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n1984 \u2013 The Uptones \u2013 K.U.S.A.\n1988 \u2013 Primus \u2013 Sausage (demo)\n1993 \u2013 Charlie Hunter Trio \u2013 Charlie Hunter Trio\n1994 \u2013 Sausage \u2013 Riddles Are Abound Tonight\n1995 \u2013 Charlie Hunter Trio \u2013 Bing, Bing, Bing!\n1995 \u2013 Alphabet Soup \u2013 Layin' Low in the Cut\n1996 \u2013 Alphabet Soup \u2013 Strivin'\n1996 \u2013 Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel \u2013 Highball with the Devil\n1997 \u2013 Christi\u00f3n \u2013 Ghetto Cyrano\n2000 \u2013 RatDog \u2013 Evening Moods\n2001 \u2013 RatDog \u2013 Live at Roseland\n2001 \u2013 Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade \u2013 Live Frogs Set 1\n2001 \u2013 Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade \u2013 Live Frogs Set 2\n2002 \u2013 The Les Claypool Frog Brigade \u2013 Purple Onion\n2005 \u2013 Les Claypool \u2013 5 Gallons of Diesel (DVD)\n2009 \u2013 Band of Brotherz \u2013 Deadbeats and Murderous Melodys\n2010 \u2013 Primus \u2013 June 2010 Rehearsal (EP)\n2011 \u2013 Primus \u2013 Green Naugahyde\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJayLane.net \u2013 Official site (archived)\nPrimusville.com \u2013 Official Primus site\nRat-Dog.com \u2013 Official RatDog site",

            "content": "Revival is a novel by American writer Stephen King, published on November 11, 2014 by Scribner. This was King's second novel published during 2014, and his fourth since 2013.\n\n\n== Background information ==\nThe novel was first mentioned by King on June 20, 2013, while doing a video chat with fans as part of promoting the upcoming Under the Dome TV series. During the chat King stated that he was halfway through writing his next novel, Revival. The novel was officially announced on February 12, 2014. An excerpt was included at the end of the paperback edition of King's Doctor Sleep, published on June 10, 2014 (ISBN 978-1451698855). In an interview with Rolling Stone, King stated that Revival was inspired by Arthur Machen's \"The Great God Pan\" and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and, like several of King's preceding novels, he has had the idea for this novel since childhood.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nWhen Charles Jacobs, a new minister, comes to town, young Jamie Morton is excited. Almost everyone in the tiny Maine hamlet comes to love Jacobs, his beautiful wife, and his young son. Things change all too suddenly when Mrs. Jacobs and her child die in a gruesome auto accident. Stricken with grief, the reverend denounces God and religion during a sermon, is banished from the town, and spends many years pursuing a career as a sideshow huckster before regaining his belief in God and becoming a prolific faith healer, fuelled by lifelong experiments with electricity. Jamie, meanwhile, grows up to become a musician and begins using heroin, which stops when he meets Jacobs again - Jacobs' unorthodox electrical treatment successfully cures him of his addiction.\nAfter being treated, Jamie experiences strange side effects, including sleepwalking and jabbing himself in the arm with sharp objects while in a fugue state, as if trying to inject heroin. This leads him to start looking into the many others that Jacobs has healed. As it turns out, many of them have experienced similar side effects, and some have killed themselves and others as a result. Later, Jacobs contacts him; Jamie's childhood sweetheart, Astrid, has developed terminal cancer. Jacobs agrees to heal her, but only if Jamie will become his personal assistant for one last experiment. Jamie reluctantly agrees, and Astrid is cured.\nJamie helps Jacobs prepare for his final experiment: Jacobs has discovered something he terms \"secret electricity\", an all-powerful energy source that he has been using to achieve his miraculous cures over the years. He now intends to harness a massive surge of this energy from a lightning rod and channel it into a terminally ill woman named Mary Fay, whom he has relocated to his lab. Jacobs' plan is to revive Mary Fay after her death, not in the conventional manner, but in the sense that she will be clinically dead and yet able to communicate with Jacobs and tell him of the afterlife and what fate befell his wife and child after their death.\nThe experiment works, but not in the way Jacobs intends. The revived Mary Fay does become a doorway to the afterlife, but to the horror of both Jacobs and Jamie, there is no heaven and no reward for piety. Instead, the fate awaiting every living person is revealed to be \"The Null\", a dimension of chaos, where dead humans are enslaved for eternity by insane, Lovecraftian beings, the most powerful of which is known as \"Mother\". Mother inhabits the body of Mary Fay, transforming her into a grotesque monster, and attempts to kill Jacobs. Jamie shoots Mother with Jacobs' gun, and she leaves Mary's body. Jacobs has a fatal stroke, and Jamie arranges his body to make it look like he shot Mary. Jamie flees the scene and relocates to Hawaii.\nLater, many of the people cured by Jacobs go insane and kill themselves and others, including Astrid, who kills her partner and herself. Jamie, one of the few survivors of Jacobs' treatments, is left relying heavily on antidepressants and reflecting that no matter what happens, sooner or later he is going to die and end up trapped in The Null under the yoke of Mother.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRevival generally received positive reviews, with many critics noting the book's nods to classics of the horror genre, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Arthur Machen's The Great God Pan, and the cosmic-horror of H.P. Lovecraft.\nDanielle Trussoni of the New York Times described Revival as \"pure Stephen King ... reading Revival is experiencing a master storyteller having the time of his life.\" Trussoni noted that the book \"is filled with cultural allusions both high and low: In addition to the Bible and Frankenstein, there are references to Thomas Edison's work at Menlo Park, Dan Brown, The X Files, the Forbidden Books (that is, grimoires banned and burned by the Catholic Church) ... As the Kingian references pile up, and become layered into the events of the fictional world, you fall deeper and deeper under the story\u2019s spell, almost believing that Jamie\u2019s nightmarish experiences actually happened.\"\nElizabeth Hand, writing in the Washington Post also highlights Revival's influences: \"King\u2019s restrained prose explodes in an ending that combines contemporary realism with cosmic horror reminiscent of H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s fiction and the classic film \u201cQuatermass and the Pit.\u201d The tormented relationship between Jamie Morton and Charles Jacobs takes on the funereal shading of an Arthur Miller tragedy.\" King's storytelling is praised as offering \"the atavistic pleasure of drawing closer to a campfire in the dark to hear a tale recounted by someone who knows exactly how to make every listener\u2019s flesh crawl when he whispers, 'Don\u2019t look behind you.'\"\nOther reviews were less enthusiastic, with The Guardian\u2032s Ben East describing Revival\u2032s ending as \"a bit odd.\" East praises the story's beginning, but opined that \"Revival takes a turn for the ridiculous\" after moving past the protagonist's childhood. \"In the context of a novel with so many interesting things to say about growing up and growing old in the 21st century, the more fantastical elements feel a little silly.\"\nTasha Robinson, writing for The A.V. Club, offered a similar criticism: \"Virtually all of Revival is a slow build that sometimes feels suspiciously like a shaggy-dog story, one which may not have a punchline. ... Revival could have trimmed all the buildup and instead been an extremely unnerving short story. King\u2019s fans, familiar with his sprawling voice and comfortably compelling style, may be perfectly content to hang out with him on this leisurely stroll toward eventual horror.\"\n\n\n== Film adaptation ==\nOn February 2, 2016, it was announced that an adaptation for Revival was written by Josh Boone while he was working on adapting The Stand. The script is currently being looked at by Universal Pictures and will be shopped around if the producers refuse it. In December 2016, Boone announced that Russell Crowe was attached to star in the film.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial page on StephenKing.com\n(in Russian) Book review on Knigosearch.com",

Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch, which launched a demonstration to counter \"Camp Casey\" in downtown Crawford.\nIt was named \"Fort Qualls\" in honor of Marine Lance Corporal Louis Wayne Qualls (20), who was killed in Fallujah, Iraq, in the fall of 2004.\nThe Crawford encampment included a banner that says, \"God Bless Our President!\"\nThe camp's namesake's father, Gary Qualls, became increasingly frustrated with the Camp Casey anti-war demonstrators when he had to repeatedly remove a cross bearing his son's name from among those the anti-war group had put up along the road to Bush's ranch. Although Mr. Qualls did not wish his fallen son associated with Camp Casey, its supporters kept replacing the Corporal Qualls cross each time it was removed by his father.\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-20-counter-protest_x.htm",

A cocktail party organized for purposes of social or business networking is called a mixer.\nA cocktail hour is sometimes used by managers of hotels and restaurants as a means of attracting patrons between 4 pm and 6 pm.\nSome events, such as wedding receptions, are preceded by a cocktail hour. During the cocktail hour, guests socialize while drinking and eating appetizers. Organizers of these events use the cocktail hour to occupy guests between related events and to reduce the number of guests who arrive late.\nAlthough it has been said that the inventor of the cocktail party was Alec Waugh of London, an article in the St. Paul Pioneer Press in May 1917 credited its invention to a certain Mrs. Julius S. Walsh Jr. of St. Louis, Missouri. Mrs. Walsh invited 50 guests to her house on a Sunday at high noon for a one-hour affair. \"The party scored an instant hit,\" the newspaper declared, and stated that within weeks cocktail parties had become \"a St. Louis institution\".\nAlec Waugh noted that the first cocktail party in England was hosted in 1924 by war artist Christopher Nevinson.\n\n\n== Dresscodes ==\nWomen who attend a cocktail party may usually wear a cocktail dress. A cocktail hat is sometimes worn as a fashion statement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCocktail hors d'oeuvres\nThe Cocktail Party, a play by T. S. Eliot\n\n\n== References ==",

George, is a British oceanographer, poet, and linguist noted as being the originator of Kernewek Kemmyn, an orthography for the Cornish language which he claims is more faithful to Middle Cornish phonology than its precursor (Unified Cornish).\nGeorge has published over eighty items relating to Celtic linguistics, including several dictionaries of Cornish. His edition of the recently discovered Middle Cornish play Bewnans Ke was published by the Cornish Language Board in May 2006. George received a Commendation for this work in the 2007 Holyer an Gof awards. He has translated numerous hymns and songs into Cornish, and also the lyrics of Die Zauberfl\u00f6te. He has composed a substantial amount of poetry in Cornish, including the full-length play Flogholeth Krist, in the style of the Ordinalia.\nGeorge lives in Cornwall, and speaks Breton and French as well as English and Cornish. George was formerly Principal Lecturer in Ocean Science in the Institute of Marine Studies at the University of Plymouth.\nGeorge was made a Bard of Gorseth Kernow in 1979, taking the Bardic name Profus an Mortyd ('Tide Predictor'). This reflected one of his research interests in oceanography, the other being numerical modelling. He has over fifty publications in the oceanographic field, including the textbook Tides for Marine Studies, which has sold over 1000 copies.\nGeorge is a Gorseth Kernow representative committee member of the Kesva an Taves Kernewek (Cornish Language Board) which is a body promoting the Cornish language.\nGeorge took early retirement in 2006, and has recently been learning Japanese.\n\n\n== References ==",

Sousa debuted in the World Tour in 2008, playing that year's Estoril Open as a qualifier, and won his first top-tier ATP singles title in September 2013, at the Malaysian Open.

            "content": "Censorship has been a fundamental element of Portuguese national culture throughout the country's history. From its earliest history Portugal was subject to laws limiting freedom of expression. This was mainly due to the influence of the Church since the time of Ferdinand I, who requested that Pope Gregory XI institute episcopal censorship. Later, the censorship would also apply to the publication of other written works. Portuguese citizens still remember the Estado Novo's censorship policy, institutionalizing strict control over the media, resorting to measures used previously against newspapers and systematic sequestering of books. In fact, every political regime was very careful with the legislation related to the area of press freedom\u2014in most cases restricting it. In the five centuries of the history of Portuguese press, four were marked by censorship.\nPortuguese history was marked by many forms of intellectual persecution. Those who dared to freely express thoughts that were contrary to official discourse were frequently punished with prison or public death.\n\n\n== Beginnings of censorship ==\nThe first books known with some certainty to have been censored by the Portuguese monarchy were the works of Jan Hus and John Wycliff, which were banned, confiscated and ordered to be burned on August 18, 1451, by Afonso V.\nLater, there is mention of suppression by Manuel I of the distribution of Lutheran texts, which earned him a commendation from Pope Leo X on August 20, 1521.\n\n\n== Inquisitorial censorship ==\nWith the start of the Inquisition in Portugal following the papal bull Cum ad nihil magis of May 23, 1536, teaching Judaism to \"New Christians\", and the use of vernacular translations of the Bible were prohibited. Three types of censorship thus became evident: ecclesiastical, royal, and ordinary.\nThe earliest existing documentation of publication licences refer to the works of Baltasar D\u00edas in 1537 as well as to the Cartinha, an introduction to Jo\u00e3o de Barros' \"Grammar\", in 1539.\n\nOn November 2, 1540, Henry I, who had been named Grand Inquisitor by John III, gave to the prior of the Dominicans the authority to verify the type of books sold in both public and private libraries, as well as to prohibit the granting of the Imprimatur, the Church's permission, to any book without prior examination. In 1598, the General Inquisitor Ant\u00f3nio de Matos Noronha conceded this privilege to other clerical orders, as the Dominicans had a monopoly on the review of books.\nOn July 16, 1547, the restrictions were lessened somewhat due to the directives in the bull Meditatis cordis, although the first edition of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in Portugal appeared in 1515, as a consequence of the Fifth Council of the Lateran. The Index virtually reproduced the lists of books proscribed by the Sorbonne in 1544 and by the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain (Catholic University of Leuven) in 1546.\nAs a consequence of the Inquisition's discovery that foreign-born professors were in possession of prohibited books, monitoring of books was extended to customs. They began to verify the orthodoxy of books entering the country in greater detail. A second edition of the Index was published on July 4, 1551, in which the Portuguese censors expanded the list of works prohibited by the theologians of Leuven to include the books catalogued by the Swiss scholar Conrad Gesner in their Bibliotheca Universalis, in addition to other works, seven folios of Gil Vicente among them. This would be the first Portuguese Index to be created, and would be published in all national territories by the Inquisitors who had, according to Inquisition order, to take in and note all found books and report their owners to the Inquisition itself.\nIn 1557, Pope Paul IV, due to pressure from the University of Leuven and Charles I of Spain, ordered the creation of the Roman Index, where owners of forbidden books were sentenced to 'latae sententitae' excommunication (implying automatic excommunication) and \"perpetual infamy\". Such severity, even for those times, brought a wave of panic to European booksellers, dealers, and intellectuals. Portugal was no exception.\nIn 1561, the Dominican Francisco Foreiro signed a new Portuguese Index, by order of then-Cardinal Henry I, who wrote as introduction to it a letter in which, while not being as hostile as the one by the Holy See, proclaimed the need for \"preventive Censorship\".\nOn October 21, 1561, the Grand Inquisitor defined the duties of the \"Carrack inspectors\", who would inspect the works brought from foreign lands by sea.\nCensorship efforts in Portugal were openly recognized by Pope Pius IV, who appointed Friar Francisco Foreiro to head the commission of the Council of Trent, responsible for reviewing Paul IV's Index.\nThe Portuguese friar was the author of the rules that preceded the Synod's Index, published by Pope Paul V, and that would later be used in all upcoming Indexes. The Index of Trent was published in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon in the same year, with an addendum called Rol dos livros que neste Reino se proibem (Roll of the books which in this Kingdom are forbidden - List of banned books). This list would be added to all subsequent editions of the Index in Portugal.\nKing Sebastian of Portugal, enacting a law on June 18, 1571, had an important role in censorship legislation defining the civil penalties for Index infractors. He defined a fine of from a fourth to a half of the infractors' legal possessions, plus the penalty of exile in Brazil or an African colony. Death sentences were also not uncommon. Apprehended books were burned and burnings were supervised by clerics.\n\n\n== Portuguese Indexes until the end of the Inquisition ==\n\nIn 1581, Jorge de Almeida, Archbishop of Lisbon, published a new Index in which the Tridentine document is reprinted.\nThe Holy Inquisition Council's Regulations of March 1, 1570 stated that all local inquisitors no longer had authority over preventive censorship, centralizing their functions on the Inquisitorial Council .\nIn 1596, Pope Clement VIII publishes an Index, the last one of the century, which was translated and reprinted in Lisbon the next year.\nThe Philippine Orders of 1603, from Philip II's regency, reaffirm the mandatory character civil preventive censorship, as had been established by King Sebastian.\nIn 1624, Great Inquisitor Fernando Martins Mascarenhas created, with the help of Jesuit Baltasar \u00c1lvares, the first Index of the 17th century, which had a new feature: general guidance - the rules of the Portuguese Catalogue - besides the ones from the Universal Roman Catalogue. The Index consisted, therefore, of three parts: the Tridentine Index, the Index pro Regnis Lusitaniae, and a section detailing the content to be removed from any book published about the Scriptures, philosophy, theology, the occult, and even science and literature. This Index would be in use until the 18th century.\nA decree of April 29, 1722 created a memorable and unique exception to this regulations, by freeing the Royal Academy of History from any kind of censorship, especially Inquisitional.\nWith the establishment of the liberal regime in Portugal, the Inquisition came to an end, and its censorship with it.\n\n\n== Royal Censorial Court ==\nThe Marquis of Pombal simplified the process of book censorship by institutionalizing one sole court, called Real Mesa Cens\u00f3ria (Royal Censorial Court), and appointing as its president noted linguist and writer Manuel do Cen\u00e1culo, the same man who inspired him to found the National Library. He also minimized the censorship against \"heretical actions\", instead directing the repression against the Freemasons and the Jesuits, both seen as threats to the Royalty. Indeed, the greatest focus in King Joseph I's reign was the utter elimination of any obstacles whatsoever in the way of complete monarchical power. The monarchy was seen as the absolute sovereign authority, with the divine right to rule.\nA new law passed on April 5, 1768 reaffirmed the right of \"temporal sovereignty\" over the prohibition of \"pernicious books and papers\" in the interest of political defense. This law actually prohibited even certain documents issued by the Holy See like the In Coena Domini bull of 1792 (which reserved exclusively to the Pope powers now claimed by the Monarch) and the Expurgation Indexes.\nThese indexes, like the one from 1624, were presented as a subversive scheme by the Jesuits of the Col\u00e9gio de Santo Ant\u00e3o (an important education institution of the time).\nIt was also through this law that the Real Mesa Cens\u00f3ria was instituted, unifying the previous three censorship departments, and directed by \"Censores R\u00e9gios\" (Royal Censors), including an Inquisitor from Lisbon and the Vicar-General of the Patriarchy. The Court was presented as a \"Junta\", with \"private and exclusive jurisdiction on anything regarding the exam, approval or reproval of books and papers\", publishing regular edicts on listing banned works.\nThe Regimento da Real Mesa Cens\u00f3ria (Charter of the Royal Censorial Court) of May 18, 1768, makes provisions for the inspection of bookshops, libraries and printing presses. Works that conveyed superstitious, atheistic, or heretical ideas were forbidden, even though exceptions were provided for some works by Protestant scholars. Such works were accepted in \"well governed and prudent (wise) Roman Catholic States\", being tolerated only thanks to the provisions contained in the peace of Westphalia treaties, and because their erudition was recognized and deemed useful for the Portuguese scholars. Works by Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, Jean Barbeyrac, among others, were accepted, although they supported some heterodox views. Voltaire also risked being completely banned in Portugal. That was at least the intent of Ant\u00f3nio Pereira de Figueiredo, but the Dominican friar Francisco de S\u00e3o Bento decided against censoring works of history and theater.\n\n\n== Liberalism ==\n\nMary I's Carta de Lei (law) of 1787 replaced the Real Mesa Cens\u00f3ria with the Mesa da Comiss\u00e3o Geral sobre o Exame e Censura dos Livros (Board of the General Commission on the Exam and Censorship of the Books), the Queen having asked Pope Pius VI to provide this organ with the adequate jurisdiction for the censorship works throughout the entire Portuguese Empire. On December 17, 1793 Portugal returned to a system similar to the one in use before the Real Mesa Cens\u00f3ria, with the separation of duties between 3 authorities: Pontifical, Royal and Episcopal. This meant that the Inquisition once again set foot on Portuguese lands. These were, however, times of change. Some periodicals, like the Correio Brasiliense (1808), the Investigador Portugu\u00eas (1811), and the Campe\u00e3o Portugu\u00eas, managed to evade investigation during this period. During the Peninsular war, a rigorous regime of censorship was instituted by the French authorities, similar to the one in place in France at the time. Despite that, clandestine newspapers were still published. It would be from London, however, that the political refugees, with the support of local Portuguese merchants, would start an abundant literary production and an effort to translate the most important liberal works by John Locke, Adam Smith and Benjamin Franklin, among others, and establish dozens of periodicals, some of them being printed until after the Civil War.\nThe Decree of March 31, 1821 brought the \"Tribunal do Santo Oficio\" (the Inquisition) to an end, because it is found to be \"incompatible with the principles adopted as basis for the Constitution\", being \"the spiritual and the merely ecclesiastical causes\" returned to the \"Episcopal Jurisdiction\". The Constitution of 1822 established the freedom of the press (\"the free communication of thoughts\"), without the need for prior censorship, though it still reserved the possibility for any abuse to be punished \"in the cases and the way the law determines\". The censorship in matters of religion was left, reserved to the ecclesiastical episcopal power, being the government obligated to help the bishops in punishing whoever was found guilty. This period of relative freedom, would however, be a short one. With the Vilafrancada, one year later, prior censorship was once again reintroduced. On November 13, John VI, aware of the revolutionary influences that were coming into the country through several newspapers printed abroad, extended censorship also to include international papers, which would, from then on, require a royal license to enter the country. From 1824, censorship was handled by two instances (being the third one, the Inquisition definitely extinct): the \"Censura do Ordin\u00e1rio\" (Ordinary Censor) and the \"Desembargo do Pa\u00e7o\" (roughly the Custom House Censor, for foreign materials).\n\nThe \"Carta Constitucional\" (Constitutional Charter) of 1826 once again rejected prior censorship, as is stated in article 145, third paragraph: \"Everyone can communicate their thoughts by words and writings, and publish them through the press, without depending upon censorship, as long as they are made to answer for any abuse that is committed while exercising that right, in the cases and form prescribed by the law\". Quickly, however, the government tried to establish a stricter control in its press policies. Francisco Manuel Trigoso, the chief of government, established on September 23, the \"Comiss\u00e3o de Censura\" (Censorship Commission) for \"handbills and periodical writings\" (newspapers). By August 16, 1828, this commission had been abolished, with its censorship responsibilities being transferred to the \"Mesa do Desembargo do Pa\u00e7o\" (the appellate court).\nIt would be on November 21, 1833, with the liberal regime in place, that Joaquim Ant\u00f3nio de Aguiar would sign a decreto-lei nominating those responsible for the prior censorship of Portuguese newspapers until a law that agreed with the constitutional principle came into force (a Decreto-Lei (decree) is a law enacted by the government alone, as opposed to the parliament, and is usually accepted as morally weaker). This law would be signed into effect on December 22, 1834, abolishing prior censorship, but making provisions for the prosecution of abuses, namely those against the Roman Catholic Church, the state, or the \"bons costumes\" (good habits - the public morals), and for slander.\nOn February 3, 1840, a complaint was brought by the owners of typographical workshops to the C\u00e2mara dos Deputados (Chamber of Deputies - the parliament), alleging that \"without condemnation or sentence\", they had been the victims of the whims of the authorities (police) which had been coming into the workshops and destroying their presses. On the night of August 11 of that same year, there was rioting in the streets of Lisbon, which lead Queen Mary II to begin a cycle of constant and successive \"temporary\" elimination of liberties, like the freedom of press, resulting in further rioting. The law of October 19, drafted by Costa Cabral, forced publishers to pay hefty bonds, deposits and mortgages, and to submit to an exam qualifying them as honorable persons. Press freedom would only be formally reestablished through the law of August 3, 1850 (known as the \"Lei das Rolhas\" [the bottle-corks law]), even though public opinion did not regard it as being in the spirit of the Constitution, because it still contained heavy sanctions which in practice completely restricted the activity of writers and journalists. Among the intellectuals that rebelled against this law were Alexandre Herculano, Almeida Garrett, Ant\u00f3nio Pedro Lopes de Mendon\u00e7a, Jos\u00e9 Est\u00eav\u00e3o de Magalh\u00e3es and Latino Coelho. Also sharing this opinion was the Duque of Saldanha, who shortly after rising to power, revoked it, opening a period known as the \"Regenera\u00e7\u00e3o\" (regeneration/renewal) which would be especially welcomed by journalists after the law of May 17, 1866 specifically abolished any \"bonds or restrictions to the periodical press\".\n\nThe monarchic regime, however, tried to face the growing power of republican ideals. The first repressive action taken in this context was the closure of the Confer\u00eancias do Casino (the Casino Conferences, republican public meetings), where Antero de Quental, Augusto Soromenho, E\u00e7a de Queiroz and Adolfo Coelho had already spoken. When Salom\u00e3o Saragga was to take the stand to speak about the \"Divinity of Jesus\", the room was closed, under the pretext that the discussions were offensive to religion and to the \"Fundamental Code of the Monarchy\". After the protests of a few dozen Portuguese intellectuals against this attitude of the government, Antero de Quental and Jaime Batalha appealed the parliament to recognize these actions as illegal. Deputy Luis de Campos brought his protest to the Marqu\u00eas de \u00c1vila e Bolama, the Prime Minister at the time: \"sue them but don't close them, you don't have the power for that\".\nOn March 29, 1890, a dictatorial decree imposed severe sanctions on newspaper publishers, and forceful closure should they repeat the offense. On February 13, 1896 the government of Hintze Ribeiro took even more drastic actions. Despite no legal provisions existing for prior censorship, the police seized any materials that criticized the monarchic institutions. It would be another two years until the press once again enjoyed more freedom. This state of things would last until June 20, 1907, when through a coup d'etat Jo\u00e3o Franco came to power, and any \"writings, drawings or printed papers deemed dangerous to public order or security\" were forbidden. The Governadores Civis (Civil Governors - the representative of the central government in the district) were allowed to close down newspapers. This law would be officially repealed when Manuel II was enthroned, but the repression would be unchanged and a \"gabinete negro\" (dark cabinet) would be added to every criminal court, in order to watch over the Press in each judicial district.\n\n\n== First Republic ==\n\nWith the proclamation of the Republic, a new press law was quickly passed on October 28, 1910, which, according to its thirteen articles, aimed at reinstating freedom of expression. Critiques of the government or of any political or religious doctrine would no longer be impeded. However, faced with difficulties implementing the new regime, the republican government also imposed, on July 9, 1912, a set of measures and situations that warranted the confiscation of printed materials by the judicial authorities. Thus were forbidden publications of pornographic content or those that would outrage the republican institutions or jeopardize the security of the State.\nCensorship was reinstated on March 12, 1916, after the declaration of war by Germany. Seizures were ordered of all documents whose publication might hinder national security or could be perceived as anti-war propaganda. Prior censorship, now a task of the Department of War, was always seen as a temporary exception, being unconstitutional. The military coup by Sid\u00f3nio Pais would be in part justified with the unpopularity of prior censorship, which was now very obvious in the newspapers, as the space occupied by the censored text was intentionally left blank, so as to indicate to readers that the text had been censored. Sid\u00f3nio Pais would, however, resort to prior censorship, adding it to all other repressive actions by his government until the end of the War.\n\n\n== Estado Novo ==\nAfter the Coup of May 28, 1926, Gomes da Costa signed a decree on July 5 that would secure freedom of thought \"independent from bonds and censorship\", even though it insisted on prohibiting offences to the republic's institutions or any behaviour that would disturb public order. The Press Law of the new military executive repeated almost word-for-word the assurances of article 13 from the previous Press Law, allowing criticism and discussion of legislative bills, political and religious doctrines, acts of government, and so forth, as long as the goal was to \"enlighten and prepare the (public) opinion for the necessary reforms(...)\". On July 29, however, prior censorship was re-instated. The Estado Novo never took a definite stance on the censorship, avoiding even discussion of the subject the few times the issue was raised in the Parliament. If only the signed legislation is taken into account, one might suppose the regime was quite lenient. On May 27, 1927 the Literary Property Law was reformed, which in its letter guaranteed censorship-free publication. A decree of September 3, 1926 had already extended the freedom of the press concept to apply on the Overseas Provinces, pending a future law that would be signed into effect on June 27, 1927.\nOn April 11, 1933 a new constitution was published. While its article 8, n.4, would establish the \"freedom of thought under any form\", n.20 of the same article states that \"special laws will regulate the exercise of the freedom of expression\". One article would also explain that the purpose of censorship is \"to prevent the perversion of public opinion in its function of social force and (censorship) should be exercised so as to defend (public opinion) from all factors that might make it stray from the truth, justice, morality, good administration and common good, and to avoid that the fundamental principles of organization of society are attacked\". As would be expected, the government reserved for itself the definition of criteria for this truth, justice, and morality. In fact it would be Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar himself who said in that same year, \"Men, groups and classes see, observe things, study the events, under the light of their own interest. Only an institution has, by duty and position, to see everything under the light of everyone's interest\".\nThe decree 22 469, published on the same day as the Constitution, was explicit in establishing prior censorship for periodicals, \"handbills, leaflets, posters and other publications, whenever in any of them political or social matters are covered\". By May 14, 1936, the creation of newspapers was regulated and official public notices were also removed from some of them, so as to prevent any sort of official connection between government and the press.\nThe \"Regulamento dos Servi\u00e7os de Censura\" (Censorship Services Regulations) was adopted in November of the same year but was, however, not published in the Di\u00e1rio do Governo (the official journal). Whoever wanted to establish a newspaper or magazine would have to, from the on, require a permit from the direction of the Service. In order to prevent white spaces from appearing in newspapers' pages, as had happened during the First Republic, the Estado Novo would force them to completely reorganize the pages before printing, so that any traces of censorship were disguised. Adding to this, editors were sometimes forced to submit pre-press pages to the censorship commission which would make maintaining a paper unbearably expensive and eventually drove some editors into bankruptcy. In 1944 the Censorship Service fell under the \"Secretariado Nacional de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o\" (National Information Secretariat) which in turn was under the control of Salazar himself.\n\nUsing the \"l\u00e1pis azul\" (blue pencil, which came to be a symbol of censorship), city and district censors would strike out any text deemed unsuitable for publication. While receiving generic instructions regarding which subjects were sensitive and should be censored, each censor would decide by himself what was admissible or not, resulting in considerable variations in what got published. This was mainly because censors were intellectually a very disparate group: while some would quickly cut any \"dangerous\" text, others would let by openly subversive content. This becomes readily clear by examining the original, struck-out articles preserved to date.\nAn order from the Direction of Censorship Services noted that, concerning children's and young adult books, \"it seems desirable that the Portuguese children are educated, not as citizens of the world, in preparation, but as Portuguese children, that will soon no longer be children but will continue to be Portuguese\".\nBooks were not subject to prior censorship, but could be confiscated after being published. This would be frequently enforced by the Direc\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral de Seguran\u00e7a (General Directorate of Security, the political police), which would issue search warrants for bookstores. The post office would also monitor any mailing of books. The Inspec\u00e7\u00e3o Superior de Bibliotecas e Arquivos (Library and Archive Inspection) would also forbid the reading of certain documents, namely those concerning Portuguese India after the War of Ba\u00e7aim (1732/1739). The Biblioteca Nacional (National Library) would also keep a list of books that were not to be read.\nWhen Salazar was replaced in office by Marcello Caetano, some liberalization was promised. In an interview given to the O Estado de S. Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper, Caetano himself promised to enact a new Press law shortly thereafter. However, little did change. According to \"Evolution in Continuity\", Caetano's political doctrine, \"Prior Censorship\" was now termed \"Prior Exam\". The State Secretary for Information and Tourism would say that: \"Nothing has changed in this house, not the spirit, nor the devotion to essential values, nor the course of action\", maintaining what was Salazar's stated purpose for the institution: \"To maintain the truth\". As an example of the \"new\" state of things, on October 26, 1972, for an article about the prohibition of a play (an adaptation of \"O Arco de Sant\u2019Ana\" by Almeida Garrett), the Prior Exam Services from Oporto rejected a version that referred to the prohibition: \"Don't mention it was forbidden. It can be said, however, that it won't come to stage\".\n\n\n== Effect of censorship on Portuguese culture ==\nEven Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es had to submit the text of \"Os Lus\u00edadas\" to the censorship of the Inquisition, being forced to debate it verse by verse. That which is today considered the greatest poem in Portuguese language went through a phase of abandonment, being ignored and despised, which can also be considered a subtle form of censorship.\nDami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is received the Imprimatur for his \"Cr\u00f3nica do Felic\u00edssimo Rei D. Manue\" in 1567. Five years later, however, it was still waiting for Bishop Ant\u00f3nio Pinheiro to correct an error in one of the pages. Prior censorship gave free rein to censors who could easily exploit any minuscule question they might have with the authors to delay the publication of the work.\nEven Father Ant\u00f3nio Viera was jailed by the Inquisition from 1665 to 1667, because he openly supported the works of the New Christians and criticizing actions of the Dominican inquisitors.\nMore serious were the processes that involved dramatist Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 da Silva, known as \"O Judeu\" (The Jew), who was arrested and tortured together with his mother in 1726. In 1737 he was arrested again, also with his mother, wife and daughter, being decapitated and burned in an auto-da-f\u00e9 in Lisbon, his wife and mother suffering the same fate.\nFrancisco Xavier de Oliveira, Cavaleiro de Oliveira was luckier, managing to evade on August 18, 1761, the last auto-da-f\u00e9 held in Portugal, exiling himself in the Netherlands. His works, however, were apprehended and burned.\nLater, during the Estado Novo, Maria Velho da Costa, Maria Teresa Horta and Maria Isabel Barreno were involved in a court case due to the publication of their \"Novas cartas portuguesas\" (New Portuguese Letters), which allegedly contained pornographic and immoral content and which is today considered no more than a sharp criticism of the Portuguese chauvinism and a commentary on the condition of women in society.\nMaria Velho da Costa would, as a reaction to this proceedings write \"Ova Ortegrafia\" (Ew Rthography) which begins with \"(I) [h]ave [d]ecided [t]o [c]ut [m]y [w]riting, [t]hat [w]ay I [s]pare [t]he [w]ork [o]f [w]ho [w]ant [t]o [c]ut [m]e (...) \" (letters within brackets added for readability).\nWriters fear that their works will end up prohibited, and therefore some things are not worth writing, lest they damn the whole book. Journalists were always the ones that suffered the most from this self-imposed censorship, as there would bear responsibility for any delays in the newspaper, for some ill-pondered or reckless phase. Ferreira de Castro wrote in 1945 \"Each of us, when writing, places an imagiary censor on the desk\".\nSome authors started using metaphors: Dawn for Socialism, Spring for Revolution, Vampire for Policeman, etc., which made some of the works unintentionally poetic, something that is today remembered with some nostalgia (even today, specially in some of the smaller newspapers, we can find an overly elaborated prose in everyday subjects). David Mour\u00e3o Ferreira wrote in the poem that was later sung by Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues as \"Fado de Peniche\", \"At least you can hear the wind! - At least you can hear the sea!\", in a reference to the political prisoners held in the Forte de Peniche (Peniche fortress), not to the fishermen of the town (fisheries and fish canning have been the most important activity in Peniche for decades). The objective of this coded wording was to induce in the audience the suspicion of everything being reported and officially sanctioned by the authorities, and let the second meaning be imagined even where there were none.\nIt is often told that in a Zeca Afonso concert the censor assigned to monitor the performance unwittingly joined the chorus of singing \"You'll end up in the PIDE\", being later severely punished for his naivete.\nMany other authors were jailed or saw their books impounded, such as Soeiro Pereira Gomes, Aquilino Ribeiro, Jos\u00e9 R\u00e9gio, Maria Lamas, Rodrigues Lapa, Urbano Tavares Rodrigues, Alves Redol, Alexandre Cabral, Orlando da Costa, Alexandre O\u00b4Neil, Alberto Ferreira, Ant\u00f3nio Borges Coelho, Virg\u00edlio Martinho, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Forte, Alfredo Margarido, Carlos Coutinho, Carlos Loures, Amadeu Lopes Sabino, F\u00e1tima Maldonado, H\u00e9lia Correia, Raul Malaquias Marques, among others.\nAquilino Ribeiro saw his book Quando os lobos uivam (When the wolves howl) confiscated in 1958. The regime brought a criminal suit against him for alleged offenses against the state, though the suit was later dropped after protests from Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Louis Aragon, Andr\u00e9 Maurois and other foreign writers. Even upon his death, any news about these events was suppressed.\nIn 1965 the Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores (Portuguese Authors Society) had the audacity to present Angolan writer Luandino Vieira with the Camilo Castelo Branco Award at a time when he was serving a 14-year sentence at Tarrafal camp for terrorism (while fighting for the independence of Angola). As a consequence, the society was shut down by order of the Minister of Education, and its headquarters were vandalized. Jaime Gama, who would become foreign affairs minister in the '90s, wrote about the issue in the \"A\u00e7ores\" newspaper and was arrested by the PIDE.\nIn cinema the regime, besides prohibiting certain movies and scenes, also sought to impede the access of the less literate to certain ideas. According to law 2027 of 1948, when Ant\u00f3nio Ferro was in charge of the Secretariado Nacional de Informa\u00e7\u00e3o (National Information Secretariat), he forbade the dubbing of foreign movies, not out of any aesthetic concern, but simply because dialog could thus be left untranslated or purposely mistranslated so as to avoid forbidden subjects. Even though censorship ended, today's Portuguese moviegoers still prefer subtitles over dubbing, and in recent years even children's cartoons have been available in subtitled, non-dubbed versions.\nSeveral Portuguese intellectuals have showed how the various forms of censorship have hindered the cultural development of Portugal. Some authors have pointed out that the Portuguese cultural elite has become something of an aristocracy, disconnected from the rest of the population. This is evident by the prevalence of a gap between popular culture and \"high culture\", with the arraiais (popular gathering with light music and ball dancing), pimba music (based on double-entendre or straightforward sexual slang) and racho folcl\u00f3rico (folk and ethnological dancing and music groups) on one side, and literature, drama and classical music on the other. Portugal has become one of the countries in Europe with the lowest attendances of theater and the lowest rates of book reading. The traditionally bad box-office results of Portuguese cinema, compared to the amount of foreign awards the same movies get, is also pointed out as a result of this gap.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nFreedom of expression was one of the achievements of the Carnation Revolution. It also quickly led critics to protest against the \"excess of liberty\" that was taking hold of newspapers, magazines, television, radio and cinema. Movies that had until then been forbidden started being screened, some of them many years after being filmed. Social and political satire became common in television and theater, a prime example being teatro de revista.\nThe Portuguese Constitution of 1976 once again included freedom of expression and information and freedom of the press in its text. Following revisions of the constitutional text have extended freedom of expression to all the media.\nHowever, incidents of censorship still occur occasionally, in the form of appeals to entrepreneurial groups, to the government, or to lobbies, to exert their influence on the media. For example, Herman Jos\u00e9, in 1988, had his TV series \"Humor de Perdi\u00e7\u00e3o\" suspended by the RTP Management Council. The Council, then headed by Coelho Ribeiro (who had been a censor during the dictatorship) justified the action by the supposedly undignified way in which the \"Historical Interviews\" segment (written by Miguel Esteves Cardoso) portrayed important figures in Portuguese history. References to the supposed homosexuality of King Sebastian are frequently cited as the main reason for the termination of the series.\nIn 1992, Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Ant\u00f3nio Sousa Lara, who had final say on applications from Portugal, prevented Jos\u00e9 Saramago's \"The Gospel According to Jesus Christ\" from participating in the European Literary Award, claiming that the work was not representative of Portugal, but was instead divisive of the Portuguese people. As a result, and in protest against what he saw as an act of censorship by the Portuguese government, Saramago moved to Spain, taking permanent residency in Lanzarote in the Canary Islands.\nIn 2004, the so-called \"Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa affair\" became public. A former leader of the PSD, Rebelo de Sousa, was a political commentator for the TVI television station when he was pressured by the station president, Miguel Pais do Amaral and by the Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Rui Gomes da Silva, to refrain from criticizing the government so sharply. This was regarded as unacceptable by the press and prompted Rebelo de Sousa's resignation from TVI and an investigation by the Alta Autoridade da Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o Social (High Authority for the Media - the media regulator) into the station which found proof of \"pressures from the government and promiscuity between political and economical powers\".\nIn 2006, Portugal was ranked at number 10 on the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, number 8 in 2007, number 16 in 2008 and more recently number 30 in 2009.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInternet censorship and surveillance in Portugal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRodrigues, Gra\u00e7a Almeida; Breve hist\u00f3ria da censura Liter\u00e1ria em Portugal; Amadora; Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o e Ci\u00eancia, 1980.\nMarques, A.

Its Latin name was derived from Alpena, a city in Michigan. Silver colored and growing to a maximum length of about 30 centimeters (12 inches) long, the extinction of longjaw cisco was a result of overfishing, pollution of the Great Lakes and the disruption of Great Lakes food chains after the introduction of the sea lamprey.\nThe systematics of the group of fishes called \"ciscoes\" is complicated and scientists now generally believe that the longjaw cisco was not a separate species, but a distinctive population of large-bodied individuals of shortjaw cisco (Coregonus zenithicus).\nThe deepwater cisco fishery caught longjaw ciscoes and sold them as \"smoked herring\". The commercial catch peaked around the 1930s when about one-third of the catch of ciscoes was this species.\nNo individuals have been reported in commercial fish catches since 1967, and in Ontario the last individual was recorded from Georgian Bay in 1975.\n\n\n== References ==\nWorld Conservation Monitoring Centre (1996). \"Coregonus alpenae\".

He attended the University of Pittsburgh originally on a football scholarship but excelled on the school's track team winning the NCAA outdoor national championship in the 110 meter hurdles in 1983 and the NCAA indoor national championship in the 55 meter hurdles in 1984. He now makes his home in Orlando, Florida.\nHe had a long and distinguished career on the track in the 110 meter high hurdles and won two Olympic gold medals. In 1988 he was unbeaten all season and was the favorite to retain his Olympic title in Seoul, South Korea. In a stunning display of technique, power and speed he won by three meters, becoming the first man to run below the 13 second barrier in an Olympic final, running 12.98s. This record stood until 1996 when Allen Johnson broke it at the Atlanta Games. Kingdom is only the second athlete to have successfully defended his 110 m hurdle Olympic title, after Lee Calhoun, who won the gold medal in both 1956 and 1960.\nKingdom set a 110 m high hurdles World Record of 12.92 seconds in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland in 1989. This stood until August 20, 1993 when it was beaten by one 1/100th of a second by Colin Jackson of Great Britain in Stuttgart, Germany, a subsequent record that stood for 13 years.\nHis progress was hampered some in 1991 when he underwent surgery to repair ACL ligament damage and remove bone chips from his knee.\nHe is also a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity.\nOn March 6, 2014, Kingdom was hired as the assistant strength and conditioning coach for the NFL's Arizona Cardinals. Kingdom will assist newly hired strength and conditioning coach Buddy Morris his collegiate strength coach and his focus will be on improving the team's speed.\n\n\n== Achievements ==\n(110 m hurdles unless stated)\n1983\n1983 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championship\ncollegiate national champion, 13.53 sec.\n\n1983 Pan American Games - Caracas, Venezuela\ngold medal 13.44 seconds\n\n1984\n1984 NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championship\n55m hurdles collegiate national champion, 7.08 sec\n\n1984 Summer Olympics - Los Angeles, U.S.\ngold medal 13.20 sec.\n\n1988\n1988 Summer Olympics - Seoul, South Korea\ngold medal 12.98 sec.\n\n1989\n1989 IAAF World Cup - Barcelona, Spain\ngold medal 12.87 sec.

            "content": "The Jesus Army is the identity that the Jesus Fellowship Church uses in its outreach and street-based work. It is a neocharismatic evangelical Christian movement based in the United Kingdom, that is part of the British New Church Movement.\nThe Jesus Fellowship was founded in 1969, when Noel Stanton (1926\u20132009), at that time the lay pastor of the Bugbrooke village Baptist chapel near Northampton, East Midlands, was inspired by a charismatic experience which led him to successfully expand the congregation, largely by appealing to a younger generation of worshippers. As the new church grew and became more charismatic in nature, many of the original congregation left to continue worshipping in more traditional churches. The Jesus Fellowship has grown considerably and there are now approximately 3,500 members in around 24 congregations in various cities and towns of the UK.\nThe Jesus Army frequently engages in evangelism in public places, seeking through outreach to demonstrate the love of Jesus and the moving of the Holy Spirit. The Jesus Army has used various slogans, in its early days adopting \"Love, Power & Sacrifice\" and later \"Jesus People, Loving People\", but since 2012 has simply gone by the name \"Jesus Army\".\n\n\n== Distinctive features ==\nThe Jesus Fellowship operates much like the house church movements, or the more radical elements of the larger, more conventional churches. It was affected by the Charismatic Movement of the late 1960s and early 70s, and influenced by the Jesus People movement in the USA. According to William Kay, Stanton was highly influenced by Arthur Wallis's book In the Day of Thy Power, and associated with a number of the early leaders within the British New Church movement.\nThe beliefs of the Jesus Fellowship are in line with historic Christian orthodoxy. Nevertheless, there are various aspects of the Jesus Fellowship\u2019s way of practising Christianity that are distinctive when compared with more conventional churches.\n\n\n=== Jesus Army, evangelism and ministry to the marginalised ===\nThe UK general public are most likely to be aware of the Jesus Army by its brightly coloured minibuses and coaches and highly visible multi-coloured camouflage jacket often worn by Jesus Army evangelists on the street.\nThe Jesus Army was launched in 1987 as the campaigning identity of the Jesus Fellowship. Following the example of the early Salvation Army, and with a stated intention to \"go where others will not go\", the Jesus Army engages in what has been called \"aggressive and effective street evangelism among the marginalized sections of society\". The Jesus Army\u2019s mission has been described as \"essentially one to the poor, the disadvantaged and the marginalized\" .\nSince 1987 The Jesus Army have held an annual high-profile gospel event in London called London Jesus Day with a three-hour public event on Trafalgar Square, then (until 2005) an evening event in a marquee on Roundwood Park.\n\n\n=== Jesus Army Charitable Trust and Jesus Centres ===\nGrowing from the Jesus Army\u2019s work among homeless street people, those involved in drug or alcohol abuse, and prisoners and ex-prisoners, the Jesus Army/Jesus Fellowship has founded a charitable trust \"to develop and enhance its existing work with many disadvantaged groups and individuals\", largely through the founding and running of \"Jesus Centres\" in UK cities and towns.\nIn 2002, the Jesus Fellowship opened the Coventry Jesus Centre including a Drop-In Centre known as \"The Bridge\", which provides services such as a subsidised breakfast, free clothing, showers and hot drinks, as well as social support, job training and medical help to vulnerable people. The Centre also assists in finding rented accommodation for the homeless, though a major emphasis of these activities is evangelistic, \"bringing people to Jesus\". Other Jesus Centres have been opened in Northampton (2004), Central London (2008) and Sheffield (2011), with more expected to follow.\n\n\n=== Multiply Christian Network ===\nThe Jesus Fellowship is also linked to around 250 other churches and groups in the UK and elsewhere through the Multiply Christian Network, which it initiated in 1992.\n\n\n=== Youth ministry ===\nThe Jesus Army hosts a yearly event for young people aged between 15 and 35 called \"RAW (Real and Wild)\". In contrast with many Christian churches which often have an ageing population, the Jesus Army has a comparatively high proportion of young members.\n\n\n=== New Creation Christian Community ===\nIn the early years of the Jesus Fellowship, a residential Christian community was founded for its growing membership. Initially a large Anglican rectory in Bugbrooke was purchased and renamed \"New Creation Hall\". Several members of the Jesus Fellowship moved in and it became the first centre of a community lifestyle. By 1979, several other large houses in the surrounding area were purchased and \"New Creation Christian Community,\" as the entire community was named, was established, with some 350 residents. Today there are around 60 New Creation Christian Community houses in the UK with about 700 people \u2013 about 25 per cent of the total membership of the Jesus Fellowship \u2013 living in them.\nMotivation for the Jesus Fellowship\u2019s venture into residential communal living and the sharing of possessions came primarily from their interpretation of Biblical descriptions of the early church. The Jesus Fellowship\u2019s community has many features in common with other charismatic Christian intentional communities and part of the initial stimulation towards starting the New Creation Christian Community came from the Church of the Redeemer, Houston, Texas, established by the Episcopalian priest Graham Pulkingham. New Creation Christian Community is one of the largest intentional Christian communities in Europe, charismatic or otherwise. According to sociologist Stephen Hunt, the Jesus Fellowship\u2019s community \"has been a source of inspiration and frequently attracts visitors from Europe and beyond who wish to observe, and sometimes imitate, a vibrant and enduring model of charismatic community life.\"\nFrom six to 35 people live in a community house, though a few larger properties have up to 60 residents. The pattern of community life in the largest, down to the smallest residence, is modelled along the same principles and pattern. Those dwelling in a community house, along with the majority of members who live outside but who are formally attached to it, make up the \"church household\".\nThe church household is the basic unit of the Jesus Fellowship, usually comprising both members who live in community and a majority who do not. Several church households will usually come together to form congregations for public worship along with members of the public who wish to attend. Jesus Fellowship congregations will typically meet in a hired venue such as a school or community centre, although latterly the church has purchased \"Jesus Centres\" in some cities and towns (see above): the Jesus Fellowship in these places use these centres as their venue for public meetings.\nThe community has founded a series of Christian businesses (House of Goodness group) employing some 250 people. Profits from the businesses help fund the wider work of the Jesus Fellowship. Businesses and community houses are owned by a Trust Fund ultimately controlled by the members.\nIn 2001, one of the houses was featured in a Channel 4 television documentary, Battlecentre. (Production summary, Guardian Unlimited Reader Reviews, BBC interview with producer).\n\n\n=== Membership ===\nThere are a variety of levels of commitment in the Jesus Fellowship with corresponding types of membership. Those in the loosest forms of membership may merely attach to a Jesus Fellowship weeknight \"cell group\" or attend only on Sundays. Others will be more involved.\nThe committed core membership of the Jesus Fellowship consists of \"covenant members\", those who have made a \"covenant\", or pledge expressing an intention of lifelong loyalty to the Jesus Fellowship. Even within covenant membership, there are four different \"styles\". \"Style 1\" is the non-resident, with a similar membership practice to that of most members of other churches. \"Style 2\" covenant members enter into closer financial and general accountability. \"Style 3\" covenant members are the residential members of the New Creation Christian Community: all their income, wealth and possessions are shared, though they may reclaim them should they subsequently decide to leave. While they are members, the value of their contribution is protected by the Trust Fund. Becoming a member of the Jesus Fellowship\u2019s community is a gradual process  and most of those who join the community have already belonged to the Jesus Fellowship as part of its broader membership first. \"Style 4\" is for covenant members who live at a distance and are unable to join regularly in the life of the church.\n\n\n=== Celibacy and marriage ===\nThe Jesus Fellowship is the only new church stream that advocates and practices celibacy, claiming it leads to a full life for single people. Within the Jesus Fellowship there are couples and there are male and female celibates. The Jesus Fellowship claims both as high callings. The main justification used for advocating celibacy is that it frees a member for ministry, particularly in the unsocial hours that Jesus Army campaigning requires. Some critics have maintained that the Jesus Fellowship teaches celibacy as a better or higher way, and that single members have felt pressured into making the vow. Others deny this and insist that both marriage and family life, and celibacy are held in high regard in the Jesus Fellowship. Celibacy is, however, described by the Jesus Fellowship as \"a precious gem\".\nSome 200 Fellowship members are committed to celibacy, plus a further 100 or so probationers. There have been instances where committed celibates have subsequently entered into married life within the Jesus Fellowship, but this is not taken lightly. Such a step can involve sanctions such as having one\u2019s leadership responsibilities reduced. Noel Stanton, the Jesus Fellowship\u2019s original leader, was himself a celibate, and the senior leadership of the church is made up of roughly 50 per cent celibates and 50 per cent who are married.\nDespite this high view of celibacy, studies indicate that marriage and the family are afforded a high priority by the Jesus Fellowship. According to sociologist Stephen J. Hunt, marriage in the Jesus Fellowship is seen as \"a ministering relationship in which human warmth and Christian fellowship can be offered to others, providing spiritual parenting for those who are emotionally damaged\". Hunt found that \"where problems in child-rearing occur, support and advice for the parents is on hand from fellow members. Even those children brought up in the New Creation Christian Community are not totally separated from the outside world.\" The Jesus Fellowship\u2019s children attend state schools.\n\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\nThe Jesus Fellowship upholds the historic creeds of the Christian faith. The creeds are a set of common beliefs shared with many other Christian churches, and consist of the Apostles' Creed, the Athanasian Creed and the Nicene Creed. It believes in baptism in water and the Holy Spirit, in the Bible as the Word of God, and in acceptance of charismatic gifts.\nThe Jesus Fellowship define their Christian beliefs in the following statement:\n\nThe Jesus Fellowship Church, which is also known as the Jesus Army and includes the New Creation Christian Community, upholds the historic Christian faith, being reformed, evangelical and charismatic. It practises believer\u2019s baptism and the New Testament reality of Christ\u2019s Church; believing in Almighty God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit; in the full divinity, atoning death and bodily resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ; in the Bible as God\u2019s word, fully inspired by the Holy Spirit.\nThis Church desires to witness to the Lordship of Jesus Christ over and in His Church; and, by holy character, righteous society and evangelical testimony to declare that Jesus Christ, Son of God, the only Saviour, is the way, the truth and the life, and through Him alone can we find and enter the kingdom of God.\nThis church proclaims free grace, justification by faith in Christ and the sealing and sanctifying baptism in the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n=== Theology and economics ===\nUnderwriting much of the Jesus Fellowship\u2019s beliefs and practices is a theology of the new creation. Regeneration brings the individual into a spiritual family that incorporates and transcends the biological family. Critics have claimed that this can tend to break up the natural family, but the Jesus Fellowship maintains that many relationships with parents have been strengthened and that the Fellowship encourages (and the community pays for) community members to visit relatives, including visits overseas if family members are abroad.\nIn line with this basic theology, all members are deemed as equal in an economic sense. There is little by way of private property for those who live in community. Jesus Fellowship community members aim to \"eschew worldly belongings and seek what is perceived as a simple and more ethical form of economic life\". It is not surprising, therefore, that the \"prosperity doctrine\" espoused by many ministries originating in the United States is singled out for particular scorn. Wealth is not regarded as a blessing, particularly for the individual. An official Jesus Fellowship publication states that \"the love of money brings selfishness in human hearts\". As far as the Fellowship is concerned, \"wealth for Jesus\" means to the benefit of the whole church and the deprived individuals it serves. As mentioned above, the wealth deposited in the common purse includes members\u2019 incomes and salaries. Approximately half of this wealth is used for the needs of the community itself and to fund evangelizing endeavor. The other half is re-invested in the fellowship\u2019s businesses or in paying off bank loans for new business ventures. In many respects the economic structure of the Jesus Fellowship might be said to be \"socialist\" in orientation and is most readily seen in the property-less community and the philosophy of \"each according to their need\".\nOne writer has described the Jesus Fellowship as \"careful with both members and money\". New community members have to live in a community for a probationary period for two years and must be over 21, before being allowed to commit themselves to full community membership. Although New Creation Christian Community members donate all their money to the Community Trust fund, if they later decide to leave the community, their capital is paid back, sometimes with interest. New Creation Christian Community keeps its running expenses and its capital completely separate, and has its accounts audited by an international firm of accountants.\n\n\n=== Allegations of sexual and financial abuse ===\nThere have been allegations of historic abuse of members of the Jesus Fellowship, including abuse of children and vulnerable adults, by the late Noel Stanton and other leaders of the group. \n\n\n=== Baptist Union and Evangelical Alliance membership ===\nFrom its inception, the Jesus Army aroused controversy. The original Bugbrooke Jesus Fellowship had long been a part of the Baptist Union. However, the sudden expansion in members made the new church a nationwide movement. This took it out of the ambit of the Baptist Union, which places authority within a specific congregation. The JA was also accused of \"isolationism\", epitomised by the JA practice of sometimes rebaptising new members who had already been baptised by other Baptist churches, implying that Christian baptism elsewhere may have been invalid. Consequently, in 1986 the Jesus Army was expelled from the Baptist Union, leaving it on the margins of the Baptist denomination.\nIn 1982, the Jesus Fellowship had joined the Evangelical Alliance, one of whose membership requirements was that the church remain in close fellowship with other local evangelical churches. Earlier in 1986, the Evangelical Alliance had launched an inquiry into the beliefs and practices of the Jesus Fellowship Church and found that it no longer qualified for membership, citing much the same problems as did the Baptist Union later that year. But at least as relevant in both cases was the fact that the rise of the JA came at a time when an international welter of anti-cult activity was under way. Allegations that the JA had too authoritarian a style of leadership and that members were under pressure to commit to lifelong celibacy, together with the fact that corporal punishment of children (rodding) was practised, and that community members were required to hand over their material possessions, left them vulnerable to accusations of cultic practices. Their intense style and all-engulfing requirement of commitment led to some allegations of abuse from disillusioned former members, and some hostility from more conventional churchgoers. A number of churches within the Evangelical Alliance threatened to leave if the Jesus Fellowship Church was allowed to remain a member.\nDuring the late 1980s and the 90s, the Jesus Fellowship improved its relationships with other churches, and broadened its membership so that community residents became a minority of the church. At the same time it re-examined its practices and loosened its style, with the result that when it reapplied for membership of the Evangelical Alliance in 1999 it received endorsements from both local and national church leaders and was accepted into membership later in the year. It has never re-applied for membership of the Baptist Union, though a number of key Baptist ministers have spoken at Jesus Fellowship events.\nDespite the entry of the Jesus Army into the charismatic mainstream, the church still attracted a range of views and anti-cult groups like the Cult Information Centre, FAIR and Reachout Trust still included the Jesus Army on their lists. Writing in 1998, Stephen Hunt summed up the outlook of the wider charismatic Christian fraternity on the Jesus Fellowship at that time as follows: \"To some in the broader movement, the Jesus Fellowship will always be something of an enigma, tending towards exclusiveness and displaying a sectarianism incongruent with contemporary Pentecostalism. To others, the Jesus Fellowship will continue to epitomize the fullest expression of Christian and Pentecostal life.\" \n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBarker, Eileen (1989).

            "content": "In semiotics and postmodernism, hyperreality is an inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced postmodern societies. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins. It allows the co-mingling of physical reality with virtual reality (VR) and human intelligence with artificial intelligence (AI). Individuals may find themselves, for different reasons, more in tune or involved with the hyperreal world and less with the physical real world. Some famous theorists of hyperreality/hyperrealism include Jean Baudrillard, Albert Borgmann, Daniel J. Boorstin, Neil Postman and Umberto Eco.\n\n\n== Origins and usage ==\nThe postmodern semiotic concept of \"hyperreality\" was contentiously coined by French sociologist Jean Baudrillard in Simulacra and Simulation. Baudrillard defined \"hyperreality\" as \"the generation by models of a real without origin or reality\"; hyperreality is a representation, a sign, without an original referent. Baudrillard believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the 'real' with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus. Baudrillard in particular suggests that the world we live in has been replaced by a copy world, where we seek simulated stimuli and nothing more. Baudrillard borrows, from Jorge Luis Borges' \"On Exactitude in Science\" (already borrowed from Lewis Carroll), the example of a society whose cartographers create a map so detailed that it covers the very things it was designed to represent. When the empire declines, the map fades into the landscape. He says that, in such a case, neither the representation nor the real remains, just the hyperreal. Baudrillard's idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by phenomenology, semiotics, and Marshall McLuhan. Baudrillard challenges McLuhan's famous statement that the 'medium is the message', by suggesting that information devours its own content. Hyperreality is the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced societies. However, Baudrillard's hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan's medium theory: \"There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined\".\nItalian author Umberto Eco explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real. Linked to contemporary western culture Umberto Eco and post-structuralists would argue, that in current cultures fundamental ideals are built on desire and particular sign-systems.\nHyperreality can also be thought of as \"reality by proxy\"; simply put, an individual takes on someone else's version of reality and claims it as his or her own. For example, persons who watch soap operas for an extended period of time may develop a view of interpersonal relationships (reality) that are skewed by how the writers depict the characters and situations within the show. Individuals may begin to believe that these extreme dramatic relationships are authentic and real, and they may begin to judge social relationships and situations by this heightened lens of reality.\n\n\n== Significance ==\nHyperreality is significant as a paradigm to explain current cultural conditions. Consumerism, because of its reliance on sign exchange value (e.g. brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one's wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition. Hyperreality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement, instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of fundamentally empty appearance. Essentially, (although Baudrillard himself may balk at the use of this word) fulfillment or happiness is found through simulation and imitation of a transient simulacrum of reality, rather than any interaction with any \"real\" reality.\nWhile hyperreality is not a relatively new concept, its effects are more relevant today than when it was first conceptualized. There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models, when the images don't necessarily represent real physical people. This can result in a desire to strive for an unobtainable ideal, or it may lead to a lack of unimpaired role models. Daniel J. Boorstin cautions against confusing celebrity worship with hero worship, \"we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are great\". He bemoans the loss of old heroes like Moses, Ulysses, Aeneas, Jesus, Caesar, Mohammed, Joan of Arc, Shakespeare, Washington, Napoleon, and Lincoln, who did not have public relations (PR) agencies to construct hyperreal images of themselves.\n\n\n== Key relational themes ==\nSimulation/Simulacra: The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by Jean Baudrillard in his book Simulacra and Simulation. The two terms are separate entities with relational origin connections to Baudrillard's theory of hyperreality.\n\n\n=== Simulation ===\nSimulation is characterized by a blending of 'reality' and representation, where there is no clear indication of where the former stops and the latter begins. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance; \"It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.\" Baudrillard suggests that simulation no longer takes place in a physical realm; it takes place within a space not categorized by physical limits i.e., within ourselves, technological simulations, etc.\n\n\n=== Simulacrum ===\nThe simulacrum is often defined as a copy with no original, or as Gilles Deleuze (1990) describes it, \"the simulacrum is an image without resemblance\". Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes truth in its own right, aka the hyperreal. He created four steps of reproduction: (1) basic reflection of reality, (2) perversion of reality; (3) pretence of reality (where there is no model); and (4) simulacrum, which \"bears no relation to any reality whatsoever\".\n\n\n== Definitions ==\n\"A real without origin or reality\" \u2013 Jean Baudrillard\n\"The authentic fake.\" \u2013 Umberto Eco\n\"The virtual irreality\" \u2013 Pater Sparrow\n\n\n== Quotations ==\n\"Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory\u2014precession of simulacra\u2014it is the map that engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose shreds are slowly rotting across the map.\" \u2014 Jean Baudrillard, \"The Precession of Simulacra,\" Simulacra and Simulation\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n=== Disneyland ===\nBoth Umberto Eco and Jean Baudrillard refer to Disneyland as an example of hyperreality. Eco believes that Disneyland with its settings such as Main Street and full sized houses has been created to look \"absolutely realistic\", taking visitors' imagination to a \"fantastic past\". This false reality creates an illusion and makes it more desirable for people to buy this reality. Disneyland works in a system that enables visitors to feel that technology and the created atmosphere \"can give us more reality than nature can\". The fake animals such as alligators and hippopotamuses are all available to people in Disneyland and for everyone to see. The \"fake nature\" of Disneyland satisfies our imagination and daydream fantasies in real life. Therefore, they seem more admirable and attractive. The idea is that nothing in this world is real. Nothing is original, but all are endless copies of reality. Since we do not imagine the reality of simulations, both imagined and real are equally hyperreal, for example, the numerous simulated rides, including the submarine ride and the Mississippi boat tour. When entering Disneyland, consumers form into lines to gain access to each attraction. Then they are ordered by people with special uniforms to follow the rules, such as where to stand or where to sit. If the consumers follow each rule correctly, they can enjoy \"the real thing\" and see things that are not available to them outside of Disneyland's doors.\nIn his work Simulacra and Simulation, Baudrillard argues the \"imaginary world\" of Disneyland magnetizes people inside and has been presented as \"imaginary\" to make people believe that all its surroundings are \"real\". But he believes that the Los Angeles area is not real; thus it is hyperreal. Disneyland is a set of apparatuses which tries to bring imagination and fiction to what is called \"real\". This concerns the American values and way of life in a sense and \"concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle.\"\n\n\"The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It's meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the \"real\" world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness.\"\n\n\n=== Filmography ===\nExistenz\n\n\n=== Other examples ===\nFilms in which characters and settings are either digitally enhanced or created entirely from CGI (e.g.: 300, where the entire film was shot in front of a blue/green screen, with all settings super-imposed).\nIn A Clockwork Orange when Alex says, \"It's funny how the colors of the real world only seem really real when you viddy them on the screen\" when he undergoes Ludovico's Technique.\nA well manicured garden (nature as hyperreal).\nAny massively promoted versions of historical or present \"facts\" (e.g. \"General Ignorance\" from QI, where the questions have seemingly obvious answers, which are actually wrong).\nProfessional sports athletes as super, invincible versions of human beings.\nMany world cities and places which did not evolve as functional places with some basis in reality, as if they were creatio ex nihilo (literally 'creation out of nothing'): Black Rock City; Disney World; Dubai; Celebration, Florida; and Las Vegas.\nTV and film in general (especially \"reality\" TV), due to its creation of a world of fantasy and its dependence that the viewer will engage with these fantasy worlds. The current trend is to glamorize the mundane using histrionics.\nA retail store that looks completely stocked and perfect due to facing, creating an illusion of more merchandise than there actually is.\nA high end sex doll used as a simulacrum of an unattainable partner.\nA newly made building or item designed to look old, or to recreate or reproduce an older artifact, by simulating the feel of age or aging. Such as Reborn Dolls.\nConstructed languages (such as E-Prime) or \"reconstructed\" extinct dialects.\nSecond Life: The distinction becomes blurred when it becomes the platform for RL (Real Life) courses and conferences, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings or leads to real world interactions behind the scenes.\nWeak virtual reality.\nThe 2008 film Synecdoche, New York in which the life of the main character Caden Cotard is lived in the confines of a warehouse made to be the set of a play which is about his life, blurring all distinction between what is real and the simulation\nThe superfictional airline company Ingold Airlines\nWorks within the spectrum of the Vaporwave musical genre often encompass themes of hyperreality through parody of the information revolution.\nPlastic surgery: the constructed face that effaces the distinction between \"natural\" and \"artificial\" in the syntax of beauty\nAirbrushed images of men and women. For example, Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAllegory of the cave\nAuthenticity (philosophy)\nConsensus reality\nCyberspace\nGame theory\nHypermodernism\nJean Baudrillard\nMarx's theory of alienation\nMyth of Progress\nRationalization (sociology)\nReality shifts\nSimulacrum\nSimulated reality\nSkeuomorph\nSolipsism\nSupernormal stimulus\nTheme park\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nJean Baudrillard, \"The Precession of Simulacra\", in Media and Cultural Studies : Keyworks, Durham & Kellner, eds.

The population is threatened by a plague. Emperor Theodosius II orders Constantine, praetorian prefect of the East, to supervise the repairs. He employs the city's demoi (\"Circus factions\") in the work and rebuilds the walls within 60 days.\nThe Huns, led by Attila, cross the Danube and invade the Balkans as far as Thermopylae (Greece). During the invasion Serdica (modern Sofia) is destroyed. For disobeying the terms of the treaty made since 442, Attila triples his demand for tribute to 2,100 pounds (ca. 700 kg) of gold per year; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner to 12 solidi.\nTheodosius II sends an embassy to Attila; Priscus of Panium, envoy for the Eastern Roman Empire, records one of few eyewitness accounts of Hun kingdom.\nBattle of the Utus: Attila defeats the Roman army near the Vit River (Bulgaria). The Huns are forced to abandon the siege of Constantinople. They march north and plunder the defenseless Balkan provinces (including Thrace, Scythia, Moesia, Dacia and Illyricum).\nWinter \u2013 Theodosius II chooses a policy to protect Constantinople against the Huns. He removes Aspar and Areobindus (magister militum) from their military commands.\n\n\n==== Britannia ====\nVortigern, king of the Britons, receives the Saxon leaders Hengist and Horsa \"as friends\" and grants the brothers the Isle of Thanet, most easterly point of Kent (England).\n\n\n==== Europe ====\nMerovech becomes king of the Salian Franks and founder of the Merovingian dynasty.

            "content": "Leonard Joseph Chabert, I (November 18, 1932 \u2013 September 26, 1991), of Houma, Louisiana, was a member of both houses of the Louisiana State Legislature. He was born in rural Chauvin in Terrebonne Parish in South Louisiana.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nChabert served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1972 to 1980, along with Dick Guidry, Morris Lottinger, Jr., and Elward Thomas Brady, Jr., who represented other districts which included a portion of Terrebonne Parish. and in the Louisiana State Senate from District 20 from 1980 until 1992.\nIn 1983, Chabert won his second term in the Senate in a general election race against fellow Democrat, Glenn F. Voisin, 19,530 votes (55.2 percent) to 15,862 (44.8 percent). In 1987, Chabert was again forced into a second race with Glynn Voisin. The third-place candidate, Elward Brady, had switched to the Republican Party and finished with 19.6 percent of the vote in the nonpartisan blanket primary. In the general election, he defeated Voisin once again but narrowly, 17,419 (51.5 percent) to 16,405 (48.5 percent).\nChabert died near the end of his third Senate term and was succeeded for one term by son, Marty James Chabert, an easy winner over the Republican Paul E. Brown. A younger son, Norby Chabert of Houma, was elected to the same seat in a special election held in August 2009, upon the resignation of Reggie Paul Dupre, Jr., who had succeeded Marty Chabert in 1996. Like his father and brother, Norby Chabert held Democratic Party allegiance. In 2011, however, Norby Chabert switched to the Republican Party, which had already become the majority in the chamber.\n\n\n== Chabert Medical Center ==\nLeonard Chabert was employed at some point after 1988 and prior to his death at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge. The Leonard J. Chabert Medical Center in Houma, a regional acute-care facility, is named in his honor. The center began in 1978 as a teaching hospital providing clinical training to medical students and physicians. In 2009, LJCMC completed a study of patients suffering from heart failure. Some 42 percent of the patients there are Medicaid recipients. LJCMC is a surgical facility too; it has 156 beds.\nIn his Senate campaign, Norby Chabert recalled his father's dedication to bringing Chabert Medical Center to Acadiana:\n\nNot only did my father bring the Impossible Dream of a charity hospital to the bayou region, but he fought every session, not only to have it funded, but he fought to keep its very doors open. He knew what it was like to grow up poor and have no health care. ... It was his life's mission to take care of the sick and the uninsured of the bayou region. Upon his death, his legacy of fighting for the medical center was rewarded by having \"his hospital\" renamed in his honor. ... Chabert Medical faces the same deep cuts that used to keep my father awake at night wondering how he would overcome the funding shortfalls that threatened its closure. ...\n\n\n== Louisiana Political Hall of Fame ==\nOn February 2, 2013, the Chaberts, Leonard J., Marty J., and Norbert N., were inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield, along with several other individuals, including the late State Senator Charles C. Barham of Ruston, a former Leonard Chabert colleague, and George Dement, the former mayor of Bossier City in northwestern Louisiana.\n\n\n== References ==",

It stated its commitment to address the impact of armed conflict on children and underlined the need for all concerned parties to comply with the provisions of the United Nations Charter and international law.\n\n\n=== Acts ===\nThe Council pledged to consider the protection of children in armed conflict when discussing matters with which the Council was seized, and provisions for protecting children when considering the mandates of peacekeeping operations. It supported ongoing work by Secretary-General, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and others. The importance of unimpeded access for humanitarian organisations to areas of conflict, particularly for vulnerable groups, was stressed. It would also address the impact of sanctions on children. Furthermore, the Council intended to consider connections between armed conflict and terrorism, the illegal trade in precious minerals, illicit arms trafficking, and other criminal activities.\nAll parties to armed conflict were called upon to:\n(a) respect international instruments relating to children in armed conflict;\n(b) protect and provide assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons;\n(c) promote and protect the rights of girls in armed conflict;\n(d) abide by commitments made to the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict;\n(e) provide protection for children in peace agreements.\nAll Member States, the Secretary-General, United Nations bodies and various international organisations were also asked to address the protection of children and child soldiers in areas of armed conflict. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to submit a report by 31 October 2002 on the implementation of the current resolution and to list parties involved in armed conflict that recruited children in violation of their international obligations; 23 parties were subsequently named.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of international instruments relevant to the worst forms of child labour\nList of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1301 to 1400 (2000\u20132002)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nText of the Resolution at undocs.org",

It is a sub-prefecture of the department.\nAt an altitude of 1,326 metres (4,350 feet) it is the highest city in France, based on the French definition as a community containing more than 2,000 inhabitants. Brian\u00e7on's most recent population estimate is 11,645.\nBrian\u00e7on is built on a plateau centred on the confluence of the Durance and the Guisane rivers.\n\n\n== History ==\nBrian\u00e7on was the Brigantium of the Romans and formed part of the kingdom of King Cottius. Brigantium was marked as the first place in Gallia after Alpis Cottia (Mont Gen\u00e8vre). At Brigantium the road branched, to the west through Grenoble to Vienna (modern Vienne), on the Rhone; to the south through Ebrodunum (modern Embrun), to Vapincum (modern Gap). Both the Antonine Itinerary and the Table give the route from Brigantium to Vapincum. The Table places Brigantium 6 M.P. from Alpis Cottia. Strabo mentions the village Brigantium, and on a road to Alpis Cottia, but his words are obscure. Ptolemy mentions Brigantium as within the limits of the Segusini, or people of Segusio (modern Susa), in Piedmont; but it seems, as D'Anville observes, to be beyond the natural limits of the Segusini. Walckenaer (vol. i. p. 540) justifies Ptolemy in this matter by supposing that he follows a description of Italy made before the new divisions of Augustus, which we know from Pliny. Walckenaer also supports his justification of Ptolemy by the Jerusalem Itinerary, which makes the Alpes Cottiae commence at Rama (near modern La Roche-de-Rame) between Embrun and Brian\u00e7on.\nIn the 1040s it came into the hands of the counts of Albon (later dauphins of the Viennois) and thenceforth shared the fate of the Dauphin\u00e9. The Brian\u00e7onnais included not merely the upper valley of the Durance (with those of its affluents, the Gyronde and the Guil), but also the valley of the Dora Riparia (C\u00e9sanne, Oulx, Bardonn\u00e8che and Exilles), and that of the Chisone (F\u00e9nestrelles, P\u00e9rouse, Pragelas)\u2014these glens all lying on the eastern slope of the chain of the Alps. But by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) all these valleys were handed over to Savoy in exchange for that of Barcelonnette, on the west slope of the Alps. In 1815 Brian\u00e7on successfully withstood a siege of three months at the hands of the Allies, a feat which is commemorated by an inscription on one of its gates, Le pass\u00e9 r\u00e9pond de l'avenir.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\nThe historical centre is a strongly fortified town, built by Vauban to defend the region from Austrians in the 17th century. Its streets are very steep and narrow, though picturesque. Brian\u00e7on lies at the foot of the descent from the Col de Montgen\u00e8vre, giving access to Turin, so a great number of other fortifications have been constructed on the surrounding heights, especially towards the east. The Fort Janus is no less than 1,200 m. above the town.\nThe parish church, with its two towers, was built 1703\u20131726, and occupies a very conspicuous position.\nThe Pont d'Asfeld, east of the town, was built in 1734, and forms an arch of 40 m span, thrown at a height of 56 m across the Durance.\nThe modern town extends in the plain at the southwest foot of the plateau on which the old town is built and forms the suburb of Ste Catherine.\nBrian\u00e7on is close to the Parc National des Ecrins and the Vall\u00e9e de la Clar\u00e9e.\nOn 8 July 2008, several buildings of Brian\u00e7on were classified by the UNESCO as World Heritage Sites, as part of the \"Fortifications of Vauban\" group. These buildings are: the city walls, Redoute des Salettes, Fort des Trois-T\u00eates, Fort du Randouillet, ouvrage de la communication Y and the Asfeld Bridge. Along with Brian\u00e7on, 11 other sites of fortified buildings in France were classified. Among them is the place-forte of Mont-Dauphin, also in the Hautes-Alpes department. These pieces of art were designed by S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban (1633\u20131707), a military engineer of King Louis XIV.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nThe following people were either born in Brian\u00e7on or lived there for a significant portion of their lives.\nStarting with Jacques Challiol, members of the Challiol family served as the Vice Bailiffs of the Brian\u00e7onnais region for more than 400 years.\nOronce Fine (1494\u20131555), mathematician and cartographer\nAugustin Chenu (1833-1875), painter\nEmilie Carles (1900\u20131979), author\nJules Melquiond (born 1941), Alpine ski racer\nHenry Br\u00e9chu (born 1947), Alpine ski racer\nLuc Alphand (born 1965), Alpine ski racer\nBenjamin Melquiond (born 1975), Alpine ski racer\nNicolas Bonnet (born 1984), ski mountaineer and runner.\nLaure Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my (born 1988), cross-country skier.\nRichard Jouve (born 1994), cross-country skier.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities ===\nBrian\u00e7on is twinned with:\n Rosenheim, Germany\n Susa, Italy\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\n\n=== Cycling ===\nBrian\u00e7on has often hosted starts and finishes of stages of the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9. In 2017 stage 18 of the Tour de France started here.\nAs Brian\u00e7on has regularly featured as a stage town in the Tour de France, it is a popular base for cyclists. Since 1947, the town has been the start point for a stage of the Tour 22 times, and has also been a stage finish 22 times.\nIn 2007, the town was the finish of the 159.5 km (99.1 mi) stage 9 on 17 July from Val-d'Is\u00e8re crossing the Col de l'Iseran, the Col du T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe and the Col du Galibier with a 37 km (23 mi) downhill finish to Brian\u00e7on.\n\n\n=== Ice hockey ===\nThe Diables Rouges de Brian\u00e7on play in the Ligue Magnus, the French top league.\n\n\n=== Kayaking ===\nBrian\u00e7on is situated around the confluence of the Durance river and its tributary the Guisane which are fed with snow melt in the Spring. Tourists come from around Europe to kayak and raft on the resultant whitewater rivers and their tributaries, including the Onde, the Gyronde, the Guil, the Rabioux, the Ubaye and others; often basing themselves in Brian\u00e7on.\n\nPopular white water rivers in the Alps are mainly medium volume glacier-fed rivers with long continuous rapids and few big drops. The season is short (two or three months in early summer when the snow and glaciers are melting) but the whitewater is reliable during this period.\n\n\n=== Skiing ===\nBrian\u00e7on is the base and lowest altitude station of the large Serre Chevalier ski resort. Most of the town's accommodation is used exclusively in winter, the population tripling during that period.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommunes of the Hautes-Alpes department\n\n\n== References ==\nINSEE\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

            "content": "Paul Speckmann (born September 28, 1963) is an American bassist and singer from Chicago, Illinois. He currently lives in Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b, Czech Republic. His first band was War Cry, founded in 1982. In 1983 he started the band Master as a death metal band. Due to internal problems it was put on hold and Speckmann started another band, called Death Strike for which he recorded one demo. which was later released on Nuclear Blast with additional tracks as an album.. After obtaining a deal for Abomination on Nuclear Blast, Master was approached at the same time and Master re-surfaced to record a full-length CD as well. The band subsequently broke up in the original form two days after the recording. They were replaced shortly afterward by Aaron Nickeas on drums, and Jim Martinelli on guitars. This period was followed by the Fleische tour with Master as headliner, Abomination as support, and Pungent Stench in the middle of both acts. Nickeas and Speckmann played in both groups for 26 dates on this tour. Speckmann recorded the self-titled debut album, which was really the Master songs re-recorded with Martinelli and Nickeas. Nuclear Blast turned this down, and decided to remix the original recording with Schmidt and Mittelbrun. The recording with Martinelli and Nickeas was then released as the Speckmann Project. Speckmann also played, and wrote all the songs for a band called, Abomination and recorded two albums with them. Currently he is playing bass guitar in the Czech death metal band Krabathor, as well as keeping Master alive. He also played in the Master-Krabathor side-project Martyr and released one album with them. The band Krabathor split up in 2004 and Master was reformed with guitarist Alex Nejezchleba and drummer Zdenek Pradlovsky. Master has been recording and touring Europe extensively for the last several years. \n\n\n== Discography ==\nWarcry, Trilogy Of Terror (demo, 1983)\nDeath Strike, Fuckin' Death (demo, 1985)\nMaster, '85 Demo (demo, 1985)\nMaster/Abomination split 7\" EP (Nuclear Blast, 1990)\nAbomination, Abomination (Nuclear Blast, 1990; re-released by Metal Mind, 2008)\nMaster, Master (Nuclear Blast, 1990; re-released by Displeased, 2008)\nMaster, Demo '91 (demo, 1991)\nDeath Strike, Fuckin' Death (Nuclear Blast, 1991)\nMaster, On the Seventh Day God Created...

            "content": "Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Javier Oriol Encarnaci\u00f3n de Espronceda y Delgado (25 March 1808 \u2013 23 May 1842) was a Romantic Spanish poet, one of the most representative authors of the XIX century. He was influenced by Eugenio de Ochoa, Federico Madrazo, Alfred Tennyson, Richard Chenevix Trench and Diego de Alvear.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nEspronceda was born in Almendralejo, at the Province of Badajoz. As a youth, he studied at the Colegio San Mateo at Madrid, having Alberto Lista as a teacher. When he was 15 years old, he formed a secret society named \"Los Numantinos\" alongside his friends Ventura de la Vega and Patricio de la Escosura, conspiring against Ferdinand VII and intending to avenge the death of Rafael del Riego. For this, he was imprisoned in a monastery and exiled. Afterward, he left Spain and lived in Lisbon, Belgium, France, England and Holland. On his return to Spain in 1833, he became active in the extreme left-wing of Spanish political culture. Espronceda is also known for his affair with Teresa Mancha, for whom he wrote \"Canto a Teresa\" (from El diablo mundo). He died of diphtheria in 1842.\nIn 1902, his body was moved to Pante\u00f3n de Hombres Ilustres, Spain.\n\n\n== Literary production ==\nHaving been inspired to a literary career by his teacher Alberto Lista, Espronceda began to write the historical poem El Pelayo during his stay in the monastery. The poem was never completed. Later he wrote the novel Sancho Salda\u00f1a. His other important works include El estudiante de Salamanca, whose main character is Don F\u00e9lix de Montemar, El mendigo, \u00a1Guerra!, Al dos de mayo and El diablo mundo, long lyric poems, the latter remained unfinished. Also important were A Jarifa en una org\u00eda, El verdugo, El canto del cosaco, La canci\u00f3n del pirata and Himno al sol. Many of his works display the tendencies of Romanticism, and along with Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla he is considered Spain's most important Romantic poet, as well as the most rebellious.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMarrast, Robert (1974).

            "content": "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Dar\u00e1nyi de Pusztaszentgy\u00f6rgy et Tet\u00e9tlen (22 March 1886 in Budapest \u2013 1 November 1939 in Budapest) was a Hungarian politician who served as Prime Minister of Hungary from 1936 to 1938. He also served as Speaker of the House of Representatives of Hungary from 5 December 1938 to 12 June 1939 and from 15 June 1939 to 1 November 1939. Dar\u00e1nyi was associated with the radical right in Hungarian politics, and although not sympathetic to the Hungarian fascists, pursued an increasingly authoritarian policy at home, and an alliance with the fascist powers Germany and Italy abroad.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHis parents were B\u00e9la Dar\u00e1nyi and Ant\u00f3nia Nagy. His uncle was Ign\u00e1c Dar\u00e1nyi who served as Minister of Agriculture during the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Dar\u00e1nyi started his civil service career in 1909 at Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun County. After the revolutions of 1918\u20131919 he served as commissioner then isp\u00e1n (or official) of Gy\u0151r County, Kom\u00e1rom County and Gy\u0151r. Dar\u00e1nyi became a member of the Hungarian Diet in 1927. Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s appointed him Minister of Agriculture in 1935. In addition to his political activities he played a directing role in the agricultural class movement. He also took part in the life of the Calvinist Church as a member of the Universal Convent and synod.\n\n\n== Prime Minister of Hungary ==\nHe substituted the ailing Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s. After the Prime Minister's death the Regent Mikl\u00f3s Horthy appointed Dar\u00e1nyi to G\u00f6mb\u00f6s' successor on 12 October 1936. Dar\u00e1nyi wanted to recur to basis of Istv\u00e1n Bethlen with the program of the conservation of the constitutional order, but he did not want to turn sharply against G\u00f6mb\u00f6s' political testament. He maintained the promise of the secret suffrage, but first of all he wanted to increase the gubernatorial jurisdiction and the House of Magnates' role.\nHe delimited himself from the right- and the left-wing extremes equally in the initial period of his prime ministership. On April 1937 he banned the Party of National Will, which was the predecessor of the Hungarian National Socialist Party and the Arrow Cross Party. Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi, the leader of the party, was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment for three years. But the March Front (founded on 15 March 1937), which wanted to create the peasant-civil democracy, was also not able to obtain considerable influence either at the same time.\nDar\u00e1nyi and his Minister of Foreign Affairs, K\u00e1lm\u00e1n K\u00e1nya made an attempt at the strengthening of the contacts being connected with the United Kingdom and France because of the cumulative pressure of Nazi Germany. However the western powers did not show great receptivity for these endeavours. The Hungarian foreign policy cultivated the friendship with a big trouble between Hungary and Italy at the same time. The thought of the cooperation between Italy, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Poland was resumed in Rome.\nDuring his term the gubernatorial jurisdiction was expanded again (this was the fourth occasion). From this the Regent could delay the bills begun with a year, and the Parliament could not call him to account anymore. The law took action on the National Council's erection during a case of the vacancy of the gubernatorial seat. Furthermore, the House of Magnates' jurisdiction was also expanded: the upper house could send back the laws to discussion twice.\nHe accepted the law of suffrage, which was advanced by Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s yet, in 1938. This modified the earlier provision in two concerns: it abolished the open vote but narrowed the suffrage rights. The new law reduced the number of the entitled voters with 250 \u2013 300 000. Men only could vote above 26 (regional) and 30 years (constituency), while 30 years were the women's age limits uniformly. He introduced the agricultural employees' obligatory old-age insurance. For the civil servants must had work 44 hours per a week and for the industrial workers 48 hours per a week.\nThe Hungarian military force's state was catastrophic. That's why Dar\u00e1nyi published the Gy\u0151r Program which was drawn up by B\u00e9la Imr\u00e9dy. The aim of the program was the army's equipment and its modernisation. The government intended one billion peng\u0151s for the program. This sum was earmarked for five years, but they made use of it under two years. The 60% of the program's budget was used for the development of the army while its 40% was for the infrastructure. Despite of thing this program's economy activating effect was really considerable.\nThe change took place after the Anschluss in his politics. Hungary became neighbour of Nazi Germany on March 1938 and vigorous Nazi propaganda began in the country at this time. Dar\u00e1nyi selected the shiftings towards the right due to these threats. He appointed Germanophile politicians to his government and from this he regularly expressed the importance of the German contacts. Dar\u00e1nyi began secret negotiations with K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Hubay with the intention of sharing the right extremist forces. With whom he came to an agreement about the Arrow Cross Party members may secure parliamentarian mandates, but the right extremist politicians must respect the lawful way. The conservatives received this activity of his distrustfully. Horthy also expressed his discontent, that is why Dar\u00e1nyi resigned on 11 May 1938. He was followed by B\u00e9la Imr\u00e9dy in the position.\n\n\n== Later life ==\nPromoting the First Anti-Jewish Law and its preparation are connected to his name yet. This bill was introduced to the parliament during his prime ministership, but it already became law during reign of Imr\u00e9dy. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Dar\u00e1nyi served as Speaker of the House of Representatives from 5 December 1938 until his death.\n\n\n== References ==\nMagyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikon\nparlament.hu\nJen\u0151 Gergely \u2013 Lajos Izs\u00e1k: A huszadik sz\u00e1zad t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete.

            "content": "The House\u2013Brackmann score is a score to grade the degree of nerve damage in a facial nerve palsy. The measurement is determined by measuring the upwards (superior) movement of the mid-portion of the top of the eyebrow, and the outwards (lateral) movement of the angle of the mouth. Each reference point scores 1 point for each 0.25 cm movement, up to a maximum of 1 cm. The scores are then added together, to give a number out of 8. The score predicts recovery in those with Bell's palsy.\nThe score carries the name of the Dr John W. House and Dr Derald E. Brackmann, otolaryngologists in Los Angeles, California, who first described the system in 1985. It is one of a number of facial nerve scoring systems, such as Burres-Fisch, Nottingham, Sunnybrook, and Yanagihara. Of these, the Nottingham scale has been identified as possibly being easier and more reproducible. A modification of the original House\u2013Brackmann score, called the \"Facial Nerve Grading Scale 2.0\" (FNGS2.0) was proposed in 2009.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe visual appearance of the defect is described here",

            "content": "Arcaicam Esperantom (English: Archaic Esperanto; Esperanto: Ar\u0125aika Esperanto), is an auxiliary sociolect for translating literature into Esperanto created to act as a fictional 'Old Esperanto', in the vein of languages such as Middle English or the use of Latin citations in modern texts.\nIt was created by Manuel Halvelik as part of a range of stylistic variants including Gavaro (slang) and Popido (patois), forming \"Serio <La Sociolekta Triopo>\".\nHalvelik also compiled a scientific vocabulary closer to Greco-Latin roots and proposed its application to fields such as taxonomy and linguistics. He gave this register to Esperanto the name Uniespo (Uni\u00ebspo, Universala Esperanto, \"Universal Esperanto\").\nThe idea of an \"old Esperanto\" was proposed by the Hungarian poet Kalman Kalocsay who in 1931 included a translation of the Funeral Sermon and Prayer, the first Hungarian text (12th century), with hypothetic forms as if Esperanto were a Romance language deriving from Vulgar Latin.\n\n\n== La Sociolekta Triopo ==\nLa Sociolekta Triopo (The sociolect triple) does not create new Esperantidoj (like eg Esperanto II), but its sole purpose - including \"Arcaicam Esperantom\" - is to reflect styles in literature translated into Esperanto, like the Berlin Middle-German dialect spoken by characters in Carl Zuckmayers \"Captain of K\u00f6penick\" (Popido), or ancient styles in Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (Arkaika Esperanto).\n\"La Sociolekta Triofo\" thus constitutes not three new \"constructed languages\", but \"constructed auxillary sociolects for Esperanto\", understandable by every reader of Esperanto; still giving the stylistial differences from dialects (Popido), Slang (Gavaro) and ancient forms contrasting \"Fundamento\", standard Esperanto, eg. in works of Mark Twain (slang and southern dialect) or Lord of the Rings (Arkaika Esperanto for the elves, Popido for the Hobbits).\n\n\n== Differences from Esperanto ==\n\n\n=== Spelling ===\nc becomes tz\n\u0109 becomes ch\nf becomes ph\n\u011d becomes gh\n\u0125 becomes qh\nj becomes y\n\u0135 becomes j\nk becomes qu (before e, i) or c (before other letters)\n\u015d becomes sh\n\u016d becomes \u00f9 (but see below regarding -a\u016d adverbs)\nv becomes w\ndiphthongs:\na\u016d becomes a\u00f9 (but see below regarding -a\u016d adverbs)\ne\u016d becomes e\u00f9\nconsonant clusters:\ndz becomes zz\nks becomes x\nkv becomes c\u00f9\n\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nmi becomes mihi\nci becomes tu\nli becomes l\u00f9i\n\u015di becomes eshi\n\u011di becomes eghi\nsi becomes sihi\nni becomes nos\nvi becomes wos\nili becomes il\u00f9i\nThere is a new pronoun egui which is a personal, sex-neutral pronoun (utrum). Its intended use is for referring to deities, angels, animals etc.\nThe \"modernised\" form, gi, can be used as utrum pronoun in Giismo; in contrast to Riismo, Giismo does not abolish feminine and neutral \u015di and \u011di. In contrast to Hiismo, Giismo introduces \"gi\" as genus-indifferent pronoun and retains \"li\" as masculine pronoun.\n\n\n=== Verbs ===\nThe infinitive ends in -ir, rather than in the -i of modern Esperanto. Ex.: fari becomes pharir.\nThe verb endings change according to the subject. So it is not necessary to write the subject pronoun, where there is no ambiguity.\nEx: The modern Esperanto verb esti (to be), present tense:\nmi/ci/li/\u015di/\u011di/si/ni/vi/ili estas\nThe Arcaicam Esperantom verb estir (to be), present tense:\n(mihi) estams\n(tu) estas\n(l\u00f9i/eshi/eghi/egui/sihi) estat\n(nos) estaims\n(wos) estais\n(il\u00f9i) estait\nThe other verb tenses behave the same way, as does the conditional mood:\nThe future-tense conjugation estos becomes estoms, etc.\nThe past-tense conjugation estis becomes estims, etc.\nThe conditional-mood conjugation estus becomes estums, etc.\nThe imperative mood behaves differently from that pattern:\nThe imperative form estu stays estu for singular subjects, but becomes estuy for plural subjects.\n\n\n=== Grammatical cases ===\n\n\n=== Nouns ===\n-o becomes om (sg. noun, nominative)\n-oj becomes oy (pl. noun, nominative)\n-on stays -on (sg. noun, accusative)\n-ojn becomes -oyn (pl. noun, accusative)\nal x-o, kun x-o becomes x-od (sg. noun, dative \u2013 ex.: al domo becomes domod)\nal x-oj, kun x-oj becomes x-oyd (pl. noun, dative \u2013 ex.: al domoj becomes domoyd)\nde x-o becomes x-es (sg. noun, genitive \u2013 ex.: de domo becomes domes)\nde x-oj becomes x-eys (pl. noun, genitive \u2013 ex.: de domoj becomes domeys)\n-e becomes -\u0153 (adverb) (This is a new phoneme, not present in modern Esperanto. It is pronounced like the German \u00f6.)\n-a\u016d becomes -ez (-a\u016d-adverb such as balda\u016d, etc.)\n-a becomes -am (sg. adjective, nominative)\n-aj becomes -ay (pl. adjective, nominative)\n\n\n=== Nouns ===\nA noun is always written with a capital letter. Ex: Glawom = (la) glavo.\nThe verb infinitive can function as a noun, having the meaning that is carried in modern Esperanto by the root with the suffix -ado. The infinitive functioning as a noun takes, as does any other noun, both a capital letter and a case ending. Ex: Legirom = (la) legado.\n\n\n=== Correlatives ===\nki- becomes cuy-\nti- becomes ity-\ni- becomes hey-\nneni- becomes nemy-\n\u0109i- becomes chey-\nali- becomes altri-\n(Note: Ali-, which in modern Esperanto is not a correlative despite its use in that fashion by some, becomes in Arcaicam Esperantom as altri- a full-fledged correlative.)\n-o becomes -om\n-a becomes -am\n-am becomes -ahem\n-e becomes -\u0153\n-om becomes -ohem\n(-u stays -u)\n(-el stays -el)\nthe particle \u0109i becomes is- (\u0109i tiu = isityu)\n\n\n=== Articles ===\nThe definite article la does not exist in Arcaicam Esperantom. If necessary, a specific person or object can be indicated by means of ityu (in modern Esperanto tiu).\nThe indefinite article, which modern Esperanto does not have, does exist in Arcaicam Esperantom. The indefinite article is unn (which is the same word for the number 1).\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n=== The Lord's Prayer ===\n\n\n=== Romeus ed Yulieta ===\nSed haltu: cuyam Lumom ityun Phenestron\nTraradiat? Yemen orientom,\nEd Yulieta memes Sunom estat!\nLewizzu, belam Sunom, ed mortigu\nEnwian Lunon, cuyu trist\u0153 palat,\nChar tu, Serwantom eshiam, yamen\nPlid belam ol eshi memes estas.

Eghin phorjetu.\nYemen Damom miham; ho, yemen Amom miham!\nSe sol\u0153 ityon eshi stziut!\n\n\n=== Phrases ===\nSalutoyn cheyuyd!

His masterpiece was Il Sultano (1851).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe began his studies in Palermo with Pietro Raimondi. Afterward Antonino moved to Naples to study with Saverio Mercadante. Back in Catania, after this training period, he composed sacred and chamber music. He composed the oratory La disfatta degli Assiri (The Assyrian Defeat)(1850) and Gerusalemme Liberata (Jerusalem Delivered) (1852), both performed in Catania during the August Saint Agatha festivities. In 1851, at the Teatro Comunale di Catania was performed for the first time Il Sultano or Maometto II (The Sultan or Muhammad II). The same opera was performed in Naples at the Teatro di San Carlo in 1854 with enthusiastic success, thanks also to the outstanding cast of singers, which included among others the tenor Emilio Pancani and soprano Carlotta Carrozzi Zucchi. In 1859 the opera Caterina di Guisa (Catherine of Guise) was performed for the first time at Teatro Comunale di Catania. In 1859, he was appointed director of the Teatro Comunale di Catania. Antonino had to leave soon Sicily, taking refuge in Malta, to escape the Bourbon police because of his activities as a patriot and opponent of Bourbon's regime. In Malta he remained until Garibaldi's arrival in Sicily (1860), then Antonino returned to his hometown. He devoted himself again to composition and teaching. Among from period Antonino's works mention should be made for the Marcia Funebre (Funeral March), written in occasion of the Vincenzo Bellini's spoils repatriation from Paris (1876), as well as the Inaugurazione simphony (Opening symphony), written in occasion of the scientist patriot Vincenzo Tedeschi's celebration.

            "content": "Young Talent Time was an Australian television variety program produced by Lewis-Young Productions and screened on Network Ten. The original series ran from 1971 until 1988 and was hosted by musician Johnny Young for its entire run. The show was briefly revived by Network Ten in 2012 and was hosted by musician and actor Rob Mills.\nThe series featured a core group of young performers, in the vein of The Mickey Mouse Club, and a weekly junior talent quest. The \"Young Talent Team\" performed popular classic songs along with the top hit songs of the day. The original program launched the careers of a number of Australian performers including Jamie Redfern, Tina Arena and Dannii Minogue and spawned numerous hit singles, fifteen Young Talent Time albums, a film, swap cards, boardgames, toys, and numerous Logie Awards.\n\n\n== Young Talent Time (1971\u20131988) ==\n\n\n=== Production details ===\nYoung Talent Time was produced as a joint venture by Lewis-Young Productions (the production partnership between host Johnny Young and his friend and colleague Kevin Lewis, one of the directors of Festival Records) and was taped mainly at the studios of ATV-10 in Nunawading, Melbourne although occasional shows were taped at the TEN-10 studios in Sydney or on location.\nMany of the episodes from the early- to mid-1970s no longer exist as the tapes were wiped for re-use, being the official Network Ten policy at the time. Some later episodes from the series were repeated by pay TV broadcaster Foxtel in the late 1990s.\nOn average, 44 episodes were produced per year for 18 years. The episodes were broadcast in black and white from April 1971 to April 1975, thereafter in colour. The final episode aired on 23 December 1988.\n\n\n==== Caravan Holiday ====\nIn the Christmas break between the first and second seasons of Young Talent Time, Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team shot a 22-minute colour film. (At the time, Young Talent Time still screened in black and white on Australian television.) Sponsored by the Caravan Trade & Industries Association Caravan Holiday was completed by early 1972 and released in cinemas across Australia as a supporting feature to Peter Bogdanovich's hugely popular US comedy picture What's Up, Doc? which starred Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal.\nThe cast featured the then-current line-up of the Young Talent Team (Jamie Redfern, Rod Kirkham, Greg Mills, Philip Gould, Julie Ryles, Debbie Byrne, Vikki Broughton and Jane Scali) prior to Redfern's departure to tour the USA with Liberace. Despite not appearing in the film, new team member Trevor Hindmarch turned up to the premiere, as seen in the documentary Young Talent Time Tells All.\nIt featured comedian Buster Fiddess (as Mr Crawley) and Addie Black, and guest appearances by Johnny Young (in multiple cameos as a service station attendant, farmer, caravan site manager and speedboat lake), Evie Hayes and John Farnham (then known as Johnny Farnham) as himself. Fiddess died just a few days after he finished filming his scenes. There was also a film clip made for the Young Talent Team's version of The Cowsills' hit song The Rain, The Park and Other Things, shot in a park, but despite not appearing on the actual recording, being recorded prior to their recruitment, Mills and Ryles appeared in the clip.\nIt screened on television just once, on Christmas Eve 1972. It was then unseen for three decades until a restored version was featured as a bonus extra on the 2002 DVD Young Talent Time: The Collection (Universal Pictures - 2002).\nIn the opening credit sequence, Jane Scali's surname is misspelt as Scarli.\n\n\n==== Alumni ====\nOver the original run of the show, from 1971 to 1988, there were a total of 40 cast members.\nMembers of the cast who found continued success after leaving the series and continue working as performers include Tina Arena, Jane Scali, Jamie Redfern, Dannii Minogue, Karen Knowles, Sally Boyden, and Debra Byrne.\nThe show had a policy that when team members reached 16 years of age, they had to leave the series and move on, but this rule would subsequently be stretched and broken.\n\n\n=== Concerts and live appearances ===\nOver the 18 years of the original show, Johnny Young and the various cast members made numerous live appearances all over Australia, performing full concerts or short publicity appearances at various venues.\nIn 1973, Young, the cast and Denis Walter supported Jamie Redfern in a series of live concerts. The Jamie Redfern Show sold out a number of shows at Melbourne's Festival Hall.\nIn 1987, an unanticipated audience turnout of over 4,000 people caused trouble at a concert at the Westfield Shopping Centre, Parramatta. Some fans were crushed in the crowd and the concert was cancelled. Joey Dee had to be treated for a knee injury and Courtney Compagnino had to be treated for shock.\nIn 1988, over 12,000 people attended an outdoor concert held in Brisbane at the 1988 World Expo, which was broadcast on television the following week.\nAt the end of 1988, Young and the cast performed a series of concerts. The final concert was held at the Melbourne Tennis Centre on 23 December, the same night on which the last episode of Young Talent Time aired on Network Ten.\n\n\n=== Luna Park incident ===\nIn the early 1970s the cast performed at Luna Park. Due to the large crowd in attendance, they were unable to leave. Park management offered to stop the scenic railway so that the cast could exit through the tunnel. According to Greg Mills, the train driver was not told, and the train did not stop. The cast narrowly avoid injury by pressing themselves against the wall of the tunnel\n\n\n=== Final years ===\nIn 1988, an episode of Young Talent Time was shot in the United States. The two-hour special, Young Talent Time at Universal Studios, aired on 13 August 1988.\nIn its final years, Young Talent Time began to struggle for ratings, particularly following the decision of the Nine Network to move its popular early morning variety show Hey Hey It's Saturday to the 6:30 pm slot in 1985, which put it in direct competition to Young Talent Time.\nAfter four years of dwindling ratings, in October 1988 Network Ten finally decided to move YTT to Friday nights at 7.30 pm, but the change did not help. The show was cancelled three months later. The general manager of Channel 10 Melbourne, Renny Cunnack, announced on 25 January 1989 that Young Talent Time would \"not be resuming production in 1989\". Cunnack himself was dismissed as General Manager three months later.\nOn Australia Day in 1989, the Young Talent Time cast performed a concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne.\nNear the end of 1988, Johnny Young had invested a large amount of money in building his own TV studio complex in Richmond with the intention of producing the show himself and leasing it to Channel 10, but the termination of the show ended this plan, and he was forced to sell his family home to finance his debts.\nNetwork Ten continued airing compilation episodes in early 1989, initially as The Best of Young Talent Time at 7.30 on Friday nights, then as Young Talent Time Favorites at 11.00 on Saturday mornings. The last of these aired in Melbourne on Saturday 1 April 1989.\n\n\n=== List of team members 1971\u20131988 ===\nRod Kirkham (1971\u201373)\nVikki Broughton (1971\u201373)\nPhillip Gould (1971\u201375; 1975\u20131976)\nDebra Byrne (1971\u201375)\nJamie Redfern (1971\u201372)\nJane Scali (1971\u201376)\nGreg Mills (1971\u201376)\nJulie Ryles (1971\u201376)\nTrevor Hindmarch (1972\u201376)\nSally Boyden (1973\u201376)\nDerek Redfern (1973\u201376)\nKaren Knowles (1975\u201380)\nSteven Zammit (1975\u201380)\nDebbie Hancock (1976\u201379)\nRobert McCullough (1976\u201379)\nNicole Cooper (1976\u201381)\nJohn(ny) Bowles (1977\u201381)\nTina Arena (1977\u201383; longest-serving cast member)\nBobby Driessen (1979\u201383)\nJodie Loebert (1980\u201383)\nJoe(y) Perrone (1980\u201384)\nMichael Campbell (1981\u201383)\nKaren Dunkerton (1981\u201385)\nKatie Van Ree (1981\u201386)\nMark McCormack (1982\u201383)\nDanielle Minogue (1982\u201388)\nVince Del Tito (1983\u201388)\nBeven Addinsall (1983\u201388)\nVanessa Windsor (1983\u201387)\nGreg Poynton (1984\u201388)\nLorena Novoa (1984\u201387)\nTim Nelson (1984\u201387)\nNatalie Miller (1985\u201388)\nMark Stevens (1985\u201388)\nCourtney Compagnino (1986\u201388)\nJuanita Coco (1987\u201388)\nJoey Dee (1987\u201388)\nRikki Arnot (1987\u201388)\nJamie Churchill (1988)\nJohn(nie) Nuich (1988; shortest serving cast member)\n\n\n== The New Generation (1988) ==\nIn 1988 Johnny Young launched an American version of the show re-titled The New Generation.\nProduced in Australia, it starred the current senior members of the former Young Talent Time cast: Dannii Minogue, Vince Del Tito, Natalie Miller, Lorena Novoa, Beven Addinsall; and a new member, Keith Williams, from Los Angeles. The show also featured regular appearances from the younger members of the former cast, who were billed as \"The Young Generation\": Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco and Rikki Arnot.\nThe New Generation was hosted by American Michael Young, the host of the Emmy Award winning Kids Are People Too. Thirteen 30-minute episodes were produced by Johnny Young's Television House and Fries Entertainment and screened on The Family Channel in the US.\n\n\n== Young Talent Time (1990) ==\nIn 1990 Johnny Young self-funded and produced a one-off direct-to-video special titled Young Talent Time Now - 1990. It featured the final six members of the cast (Jamie Churchill, Johnnie Nuich, Joey Dee, Courtney Compagnino, Juanita Coco, and Rikki Arnot) and former cast member Beven Addinsall.\n\n\n== Young Talent Time (2012) ==\nNetwork Ten and Granada Media Australia - in conjunction with Johnny Young and Johnny Young Music - were the producers of a revival of Young Talent Time. Taped before a live studio audience at Fox Studios in Sydney, the 15-episode series debuted on Network Ten across Australia at 6.30 pm on Sunday 22 January 2012.\nHosted by former Australian Idol 2003 contestant Rob Mills, the 2012 revival featured a regular Young Talent Team (of 10 members) performing a couple of group numbers each week, with one team member featuring in a solo spot each episode to showcase their individual talents. Starting from Episode 10, duets were sung instead of solos as each team member had performed a solo.\nEach weekly episode featured three or four young contestants (or acts) under the age of 16. These solo performers, duos, groups, etc., included singers, dancers (ballet, hip hop, tap, jazz, etc.), musicians, sight acts, illusionists, comedians and so on. The winning contestant (or act) each week received $5,000 from NAB (National Australia Bank) and the Grand Final winner received $100,000.\nThe show's two judges/mentors were the original show's longest-serving Young Talent Team member Tina Arena (who appeared from 1977 to 1983 \u2013 six years 6 Months), and Filipino-American choreographer Charles Klapow, one of the winners of the Emmy Award for \u2018Outstanding Choreography\u2019 for High School Musical 2. Better known as 'Chucky' Klapow, he also helped choreograph the films Cheetah Girls 2, High School Musical and High School Musical 3: Senior Year as well as appearing in all three High School Musical movies as a dancer. He has choreographed for Mick Jagger and dances alongside Michael Jackson in the film Michael Jackson's This Is It. Klapow had previously been a judge on UK talent show Don't Stop Believing. TV Personality Ian Dickson filled in as judge while Tina Arena was ill for one episode. From the beginning of the finals competition he served as a full-time judge.\nWhile the judges decided the winning contestant (or act) of each weekly episode, viewers could vote online for any of the weekly runners-up to become a 'wild-card' entrant, giving them a second chance of making it into the finals. On 20 March, it was announced that YTT would move to Fridays at 7:30 to 8:30, the current time slot of Glee. It is believed YTT was moved because of poor ratings on Sunday night resulting in the much more popular program The Biggest Loser taking the 6:30 to 7:30 timeslot. The YTT team then commenced a tour having shows in Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra. The Grand Final episode was aired on 4 May. The talent quest was won by first heat entrants and wildcard winners Lil' Banditz Krew. The all-boys Hip Hop troupe toured with the YTT team and Rob Mills in June and July 2012, visiting various Sydney venues as well as Melbourne and Canberra. YTT was not renewed for the 2013 season because of poor ratings. However, such team members as Aydan Calafiore and Adrien Nookadu went on to have music careers and Georgia-May Davis works with Disney Channel. Lyndall Wennekes also starred on The Voice in 2014, Adrien Nookadu on The X Factor in 2014 and Aydan Calafiore on Australia's Got Talent in 2013.\n\n\n== Discography and videography ==\n\n\n=== DVDs ===\nA one-hour prime-time television documentary Young Talent Time Tells All aired on Network Ten on 29 October 2001.\nA small reunion of YTT cast and crew members (including Tina Arena, Dannii Minogue and Johnny Young) was held in Melbourne in October 2003 to celebrate the release of an extended version of the Young Talent Time Tells All documentary on DVD (through Universal Pictures). The DVD, which contained added bonus features and rare footage not seen in the television documentary, was titled Young Talent Time: The Collection.\nBonus features on the DVD include a restored version of the 1972 short film Caravan Holiday featuring Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team; full biographies of all 40 Team Members and Johnny Young; Nicole Kidman's appearance as a guest on the show to promote her 1983 film BMX Bandits; assorted television commercials featuring members of the team; footage of some of the Team when they appeared as contestants on the show; and the full-length clip of sisters Dannii Minogue and Kylie Minogue performing the song \"Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves\".\nRare footage includes a nine-year-old Jamie Redfern (pre-Young Talent Time) appearing with Happy Hammond on a Channel Seven test broadcast of colour television in 1968, seven years before Australian television actually began broadcasting in colour.\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1) Young Talent Time (Festival Records - 1971)\n2) Young Talent Time: Volume 2 (Festival Records - 1972)\n3) Johnny Young and the Young Talent Team Sing The Hits (L&Y Records - 1973)\n4) Young Talent Time Hits!

            "content": "Sustainability standards and certifications are voluntary, usually third party-assessed, norms and standards relating to environmental, social, ethical and food safety issues, adopted by companies to demonstrate the performance of their organizations or products in specific areas. There are perhaps up to 500 such standards and the pace of introduction has increased in the last decade. The trend started in the late 1980s and 90s with the introduction of Ecolabels and standards for Organic food and other products. In recent years, numerous standards have been established and adopted in the food industry in particular. Most of them refer to the triple bottom line of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity. A standard is normally developed by a broad range of stakeholders and experts in a particular sector and includes a set of practices or criteria for how a crop should be sustainable grown or a resource should be ethically harvested. This might cover, for instance, responsible fishing practices that don't endanger marine biodiversity, or respect for human rights and the payment of fair wages on a coffee or tea plantation. Normally sustainability standards are accompanied by a verification process - often referred to as \"certification\" - to evaluate that an enterprise complies with a standard, as well as a traceability process for certified products to be sold along the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing label. Certification programmes also focus on capacity building and working with partners and other organisations to support smallholders or disadvantaged producers to make the social and environmental improvements needed to meet the standard.\nThe basic premise of sustainability standards is twofold. Firstly, they emerged in areas where national and global legislation was weak but where the consumer and NGO movements around the globe demanded action. For example, campaigns by Global Exchange and other NGOs against the purchase of goods from \u201csweatshop\u201d factories by the likes of Nike, Inc., Levi Strauss & Co. and other leading brands led to the emergence of social welfare standards like the SA8000 and others. Secondly, leading brands selling to both consumers and to the B2B supply chain may wish to demonstrate the environmental or organic merits of their products, which has led to the emergence of hundreds of ecolabels, organic and other standards. A leading example of a consumer standard is the Fairtrade movement, administered by FLO International and exhibiting huge sales growth around the world for ethically sourced produce. An example of a B2B standard which has grown tremendously in the last few years is the Forest Stewardship Council\u2019s standard (FSC) for forest products made from sustainable harvested trees.\nHowever, the line between consumer and B2B sustainability standards is becoming blurred, with leading trade buyers increasingly demanding Fairtrade certification, for example, and consumers increasingly recognizing the FSC mark. In recent years, the business-to-business focus of sustainability standards has risen as it has become clear that consumer demand alone cannot drive the transformation of major sectors and industries. In commodities such as palm oil, soy, farmed seafood, and sugar, certification initiatives are targeting the mainstream adoption of better practices and precompetitive industry collaboration. Major brands and retailers are also starting to make commitments to certification in their whole supply chain or product offering, rather than a single product line or ingredient .\nWith the growth of standards and certification as the major tool for global production and trade to become more sustainable and for the private sector to demonstrate sustainability leadership, it is essential that there are ways to assess the legitimacy and performance of different initiatives. Company and government buyers, as well as NGOs and civil society groups committed to sustainable production, need clarity on which standards and ecolabels are delivering real social, environmental and economic results. The ISEAL Alliance has emerged as the authority on good practice for sustainability standards and its Codes of Good Practice represent the most widely recognised guidance on how standards should be set up and implemented in order to be effective. By complying with these Codes and working with other certification initiatives, ISEAL members demonstrate their credibility and work towards improving their positive impacts.\nAttempts to address the problems caused by a multiplicity of certification initiatives led to the launch of The State of Sustainability Initiatives (SSI) project, facilitated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) under the auspices of the Sustainable Commodity Initiative (SCI).\n\n\n== Origin of global standards ==\nMost sustainability standards that are being adopted today were initiated by social movements in particular countries, such as Rainforest Alliance in the United States and Fairtrade in the Netherlands. Other standards were initiated by individual companies, such as Utz Certified (Ahold), Starbucks C.A.F.E. (Starbucks), and Nespresso AAA (Nespresso). Some standards were launched by coalitions of private firms, development agencies, NGOs, and other stakeholders. For example, the Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) was initiated by an alliance of large American coffee roasters, including Kraft Foods, Sara Lee and Nestle, assisted by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (GIZ). One important facilitator for the development of most global standards were series of local development projects involving NGOs, coffee roasters and producers in different developing countries. For example, the Fairtrade standard was developed based on pilot projects with Mexican farmers. 4C builds on development projects in Peru, Colombia and Vietnam, involving GIZ, major coffee roasters, and local producers.\nThe most widely established and adopted standards are in agriculture, with 40% of global coffee production certified to one of the main schemes, and approximately 15-20% of cocoa and tea production being compliant with major international standards. Forestry and wild seafood are also sectors in which standards have been influential, with certified production pushing past 10% of the global share. Cotton, palm oil, soy, biofuels and farmed seafood are some of the commodities in which certification is growing the fastest, due in part to major roundtables that have been set up to bring the whole industry together. More recently, standards have started to emerge for mining and the extraction of metals - including gold, silver, aluminium, and oil and gas - as well as for cattle, electronics, plastics and tourism.\nEvidence suggests that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) adopted willingly by firms will be much more effective than government regulated CSR so global standards by private companies show promise for effective social impact.\nThe creation of the ISEAL Alliance in 2002 was the first collaborative effort amongst a group of sustainability standards organisations to agree to follow common good practices in how their standards are implemented and also to work together to drive up the use of standards and certification globally.\n\n\n== Different sustainability standards ==\nNumerous sustainability standards have been developed in recent years to address issues of environmental quality, social equity, and economic prosperity of global production and trade practices. Despite similarities in major goals and certification procedures, there are some significant differences in terms of their historical development, target groups of adopters, geographical diffusion, and emphasis on environmental, social or economic issues.\nOne of the major differences to be aware of is based on the level of strictness of the standard. Some standards set the bar high for a sector, promoting the strongest social and environmental practices and working with the top performers to constantly push up sustainability expectations. Other standards are more focused on the elimination of the worst practices and operate at more of an entry-level to get a large proportion of an industry working incrementally towards better practices. Often times there are strategies between standards to move producers along this performance ladder of sustainability. Another important distinction is that some standards can be applied internationally (usually with mechanisms to ensure local relevance and appropriateness) whereas other standards are developed entirely with a regional or national focus.\nAdditional differences between standards might relate to the certification process and whether it is conducted by a first, second or third party; the traceability system in place and whether it allows for the segregation or mixing of certified and non-certified materials; and the types of sustainability claims that are made on products.\n\n\n=== Fairtrade ===\nThe Fairtrade label was developed in the late 1980s by a Dutch development agency in collaboration with Mexican farmers. The initiative performs development work and promotes its political vision of an alternative economy, seeing its main objective in empowering small producers and providing these with access to and improving their position on global markets. The most distinguishing feature of the Fairtrade label is the guarantee of a minimum price and a social premium that goes to the cooperative and not to the producers directly. Recently, Fairtrade also adopted environmental objectives as part of their certification system.\n\n\n=== Rainforest Alliance ===\nThe Rainforest Alliance was created in the late 1980s from a social movement and is committed to conserving rainforests and their biodiversity. One key element of the standard is the compulsory elaboration and implementation of a detailed plan for the development of a sustainable farm management system to assist wildlife conservation. Another objective is to improve workers\u2019 welfare by establishing and securing sustainable livelihoods. Producer prices may carry a premium. Yet instead of guaranteeing a fixed floor price, the standard seeks to improve the economic situation of producers through higher yields\nand enhanced cost efficiency.\n\n\n=== Utz Certified ===\nUTZ Certified (formerly Utz Kapeh) was co-founded by the Dutch coffee roaster Ahold Coffee Company in 1997. It aims to create an open and transparent marketplace for socially and environmentally responsible agricultural products. Instruments include the UTZ Traceability System and the UTZ Code of Conduct. The traceability system makes certified products traceable from producer to final buyer and has stringent chains of custody requirements. The UTZ Code of Conduct emphasizes both environmental practices (e.g. biodiversity conservation, waste handling and water use) and social benefits (e.g. access to medical care, access to sanitary facilities at work).\n\n\n=== Organic ===\nThe Organic standard was developed in the 1970s and is based on IFOAM Basic Standards. IFOAM stands for International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements and is the leading global umbrella organization for the organic farming movement. The IFOAM Basic Standards provide a framework of minimum requirements, including the omission of agrochemicals such as pesticides and chemical-synthetic fertilizers. The use of animal feeds is also strictly regulated. Genetic engineering and the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are forbidden.\n\n\n=== trustea ===\nThe trustea code is designed to evaluate the social, economic, agronomic and environmental performance of Indian tea estates, smallholders and Bought Leaf Factories (BLFs).\nIt is expected that the compliance with the code not only improves competitiveness of the tea farms but also facilitates the tea farms in achieving compliance with national regulations and international sustainability standards in a step-wise approach. The applicable control points under eleven chapters are required to be adhered to within a four-year period. The India tea code allows producers to show that they operate responsibly\u2013 producing quality tea according to strict social and environmental standards. The verification under the code provides manufacturers with the assurance of responsible production and provides opportunities to credibly demonstrate this to their customers.\n\n\n=== SuRe\u00ae \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===\nSuRe\u00ae is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of resilience and sustainability into infrastructure development, through various criteria across governance, social and environmental factors. It is currently developed under ISEAL guidelines by the Swiss Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation (GIB) and the French bank Natixis. GIB and Natixis launched the SuRe\u00ae standard at a COP21 event on 9 December 2015.\n\n\n=== Other examples ===\nOther types of standards include sector-specific schemes such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO); standards for climate and development interventions like the Gold Standard, retailer-led sustainability certification initiatives such as GlobalGAP; Corporate own-brand sustainability initiatives such as Starbucks' CAFE Practices; and national programmes such as the Irish Food Board's 'Origin Green' scheme.\nThe United Nations Forum on Sustainability Standards (UNFSS) is a joint initiative of FAO, UNEP, ITC, UNCTAD, and UNIDO on Sustainability Standards.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCircles of Sustainability\nSustainability\nSustainable Development\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Recommended readings ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFairtrade International's main website\nFSC International\nISEAL Alliance initiative on sustainability standards\nStandards Map from the International Trade Center\nReferenced guide to major coffee certifications\nShaping Sustainable Markets' database of certification schemes\nTrustea Code's profile on database of market governance mechanisms\n[1]",

He became Solicitor-General to King Charles II.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWinnington entered the Middle Temple in 1656 and was called to the bar in 1660 and rose steadily, serving as counsel in various Parliamentary impeachments. In January 1672, he became attorney-general to the king's brother, the Duke of York and was knighted on 16 December 1672. He was appointed as Solicitor General in 1675 and chosen as MP for Windsor at a by-election to the Cavalier Parliament in 1677 on the King's recommendation.\nDuring the hysteria of the Popish Plot, Winnington's allegiances changed, and he participated in impeaching the Lord Danby. This led to his dismissal as Solicitor General. However he was elected as MP for Worcester in 1679 (twice) and again in 1681. While Parliament was not sitting, he defended political allies in the court and also the city he represented when its corporation was attacked by Quo warranto proceedings, as well as Oxford. His legal services remained in demand in the reign of James II of England. He was elected as MP for Tewkesbury in 1689, 1692 and 1695, though he had not initially sought the seat.\n\n\n== Family ==\nWinnington married first Elizabeth Herbert of Powick, he had a daughter Elizabeth who married in 1676 Richard Dowdeswell of Bushbury MP, his colleague in the representation of Tewkesbury.\nWinnington second and last marriage was to Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Salwey and third and youngest sister and coheir of Edward Salwey, who brought him Stanford Court at Stanford-on-Teme, Worcestershire to add to property he had already bought there with his considerable earnings. They had four sons and three daughters, including Salwey Winnington, Francis Winnington and Edward Winnington, later Jeffreys.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHalliday, Paul D.

            "content": "Mannix is an American television detective series that ran from 1967 to 1975 on CBS. Created by Richard Levinson and William Link and developed by executive producer Bruce Geller, the title character, Joe Mannix, is a private investigator. He was played by the late Mike Connors.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nDuring the first season of the series, Joe Mannix works for a large Los Angeles detective agency called Intertect, which was the planned original title of the show. His superior is Lew Wickersham, played by Joseph Campanella, with the agency featuring the use of computers to help solve crimes.\nAs opposed to the other employees who must wear dark suits and sit in rows of desks with only one piece of paper allowed to be on their desks at one time, Mannix belongs to the classic American detective archetype, thus he usually ignores the computers' solutions, disobeys his boss's orders, and sets out to do things his own way. He wears plaid sport coats and has his own office that he keeps sloppy between his assignments. Lew has cameras in all the rooms of Intertect monitoring the performance of his employees and providing instant feedback through intercoms in the room. Unlike the other Intertect operatives, Mannix attempts to block the camera with a coat rack and insults Lew, comparing him to Big Brother.\nTo improve the ratings of the show, Desilu head Lucille Ball and producer Bruce Geller made some changes, making the show similar to other private-eye shows. Ball thought the computers were too high-tech and beyond the comprehension of the average viewer of the time and had them removed.\nFrom the second season on, Mannix works on his own with the assistance of his loyal secretary Peggy Fair, a police officer's widow played by Gail Fisher \u2013 one of the first black actresses to have a regular series role. He also receives help from the Los Angeles police department, the two most prominent officers being Lieutenant Art Malcolm (portrayed by Ward Wood) and Lieutenant Adam Tobias (portrayed by Robert Reed). Other police contacts are Lieutenant George Kramer (Larry Linville), who had been the partner of Peggy's late husband, and Lieutenant Dan Ives (Jack Ging).\nIn the 1969 season, he also employs the services of a competitive private investigator, Albie Loos (performed by Joe Mantell), as a sort of investigative gofer. In the 1972 season, Albie returns, played by a different actor (Milton Selzer).\nWhile Mannix was not generally known as a show that explored socially relevant topics, several episodes had topical themes. Season two had episodes featuring compulsive gambling, deaf and blind characters who were instrumental in solving cases in spite of their physical limitations, and episodes that focused on racism against Blacks and Hispanics. Season six had an episode focusing on the effects the Vietnam War had on returning veterans, including the effects of PTSD.\n\n\n== Character ==\nJoseph R. \"Joe\" Mannix is a regular guy, without pretense, who has a store of proverbs on which to rely in conversation. What demons he has mostly come from having fought in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, where he was initially listed as MIA while he was a prisoner of war in a brutal POW camp until he escaped. Over the length of the series, a sizable percentage of his old Army comrades turn out to have homicidal impulses against him, as does his fellow running back from his college football days.\nDuring the series, Mannix is also revealed to have worked as a mercenary in Latin America. Like the actor who plays him, Mannix is of Armenian descent, despite the surname being traditionally an Irish one. He speaks fluent Armenian from time to time during the series, as well as conversational Spanish.\nMannix is notable for the high level of physical punishment he withstands. During the course of the series, he is shot and wounded over a dozen separate times, and knocked unconscious around 55 times. He frequently takes brutal beatings to the abdomen; some of these went on quite a long time, particularly by the television standards of the era. Whenever he gets into one of his convertibles, he can expect to be shot at or run off the road by another car or find his vehicle sabotaged. Nevertheless, he keeps his cool and perseveres until his antagonists are brought down.\nWhile making the television pilot \"The Name Is Mannix\", Connors dislocated his shoulder running away from a From Russia with Love\u2013type pursuit from a helicopter, and broke his left wrist punching a stuntman who happened to be wearing a steel plate on his back. This character aspect was lampooned multiple times by radio comedians Bob and Ray, as \"Blimmix\", portrayed as dim-witted, and ending with Blimmix being soundly beaten by his adversary. These parodies retained the Lalo Schifrin\u2013composed theme song at the beginning and conclusion.\nConnors later expressed his concerns over what he saw as the show's dismissive attitude toward violence and its consequences, citing the example of Mannix being thrown down a flight of stairs and appearing without a scratch almost immediately after.\nStarting in season two, Mannix keeps an office at 17 Paseo Verde in West Los Angeles and resides in an attached apartmemt. Mannix grew up in a town called Summer Grove, where he was a star football and basketball player. Summer Grove had a thriving Armenian immigrant community. As of 1969, Mannix's mother had died 10 years earlier, and Mannix had not been back to the town since the funeral. Mannix's estranged father, Stefan, was still living in Summer Grove, and Mannix and his father would start a reconciliation. When Mannix returns to Summer Grove for a case three years later, his father and he are on good terms.\nFollowing military service in the Korean War, Mannix attended Western Pacific University on the GI Bill, graduated in 1955, and obtained his private investigator's license in 1956. He is a black belt in karate. Throughout the series, he appears proficient in a variety of athletic pursuits, including sailing, horseback riding, and skiing. He is an accomplished pool player, golfs regularly, and is also a skilled airplane pilot. In the first season, he carries a Walther PP semiautomatic pistol. From the second season on, Mannix carries a Colt Detective Special snubnosed revolver in .38 Special caliber.\n\n\n=== Appearances on other shows ===\nIn 1971, Connors guest-starred on an episode of Here's Lucy entitled \"Lucy and Mannix Are Held Hostage\".\nIn 1997, Connors reprised the role of Mannix on an episode of Diagnosis: Murder entitled \"Hard-Boiled Murder\", which serves as a sequel to the Mannix episode \"Little Girl Lost\".\n\"Mannix\" was used as a reference several times by Mystery Science Theater 3000 when there was a foot chase or a fight.\n\n\n== Production ==\nGary Morton, the second husband of Lucille Ball and head of Desilu Studios, noticed a 1937 Bentley convertible being driven by Mike Connors. A car enthusiast, Morton began talking about cars to Connors when he remembered a Desilu detective show coming up in which he thought Connors would do well.\nMannix was initially a production of Desilu Productions, which had been purchased by Gulf + Western earlier in 1967. During the first season, Gulf + Western integrated Desilu's operations into its Paramount Pictures subsidiary and the company became Paramount Television. The series featured a dynamic split-screen opening credits sequence set to theme music from noted composer Lalo Schifrin. Unusual for a private detective series, the Mannix theme is in triple time, the same signature used for waltzes.\nThe show's title card, opening credits, and closing credits roll are set in variations of the City typeface, a squared-off, split-serif face that was long used by IBM Corporation as part of their corporate design and still appears in their logo. This refers to the computers used by Intertect in the first season. The dot over the \"i\" in Mannix had the appearance of a computer tape reel. This was removed after the first season.\nOver the life of the series, several famous entertainers were featured in one-time roles, including Neil Diamond and Buffalo Springfield as themselves and Lou Rawls as a club singer, Rich Little as an impressionist, and Milton Berle as a stand-up comedian. Essay humorist Art Buchwald also had a cameo role unrelated to journalism, and in another episode, Rona Barrett played herself.\n\n\n=== Mannix's automobiles ===\nThe automobile was a focus of Mannix's professional life, and he had several of them as his personal vehicle in the eight-year run of the series. Those were:\nSeason 1 \u2013 1966 Mercury Comet Caliente convertible (pilot episode: \"The Name Is Mannix\"), 1967 Mercury Comet Cyclone convertible (one episode only: \"Skid Marks on a Dry Run\"), 1967 Ford Galaxie 500 four-door hardtop then a 1967 Ford Fairlane 500 four-door sedan after the Galaxie got shot up \u2013 both were Intertect company cars (one episode only: \"The Cost of a Vacation\"). In all other season-one episodes, Mannix drove a 1967 Oldsmobile Toronado roadster customized by George Barris, builder of TV's Batmobile from the 1960s Batman ABC series, since the producers wanted a convertible and Oldsmobile never produced an open-topped Toronado. Due to a change in episode run order (\"The Cost of a Vacation\" was the second episode of Mannix shot after the pilot, although it was the sixth episode CBS broadcast), the one-shot appearances of the Galaxie and Fairlane were after the Toronado had been established as Mannix's car.\nSeason 2 \u2013 1968 Dodge Dart GTS 340 convertible \"kustomized\" by George Barris with functional hood scoops, Lucas Flamethrower driving lights, blacked-out grille, racing-style gas filler cap, molded-in rear spoiler, blacked out tail light panel, and custom tail light lenses. The car was originally red, but Executive Producer Bruce Geller wanted it changed to a British Racing Green, which Barris did. (This car still retains its original red paint under the carpet.) A Motorola car-phone (a remarkably expensive and rare item in 1968) was installed. Rader mag wheels like those on the Batmobile were originally installed by Barris, but changed later in the 1968 season to Cragar S/S chrome wheels. George Barris also installed his own \"Barris Kustoms\" emblem on the lower part of each front fender. No duplicate 1968 Mannix Darts were built; it is a \"1 of 1\" car. This car was used in both the 1968 and 1969 seasons of Mannix.\nThough a 1969 Dart was built by Barris to replicate this car in the show's 1969 season, the 1968 Dart was regularly seen during the 1969 season. (In the 1969 episode \"A Penny for the Peep Show\", both the 1968 and 1969 Darts are used in the same shot, to elude a police tail on Mannix, but no explanation in the episode was given forwhy or how two identically customized green Dart convertibles show up together.) In further tracing the car's history, the 1968 Dart was reportedly sold to a secretary at Paramount Studios and then was lost for decades until being discovered near a ranger station in the California mountains. It has since been restored to its original Mannix/Barris condition and was featured in Hemmings Muscle Machines, December 2009 issue.\nThe 1968 Mannix Dart and its intriguing history was also featured on the TV show Drive on Discovery HD Theater in 2010. The TV show reunited the car with Mike Connors for the first time in over 40 years. The car is currently owned by C. Van Tune, former editor-in-chief of Motor Trend magazine, who conducted the TV interview with Mike Connors and who also wrote an article on the Mannix Dart for the summer 2011 issue of Motor Trend Classic magazine. In that article, the Dart is reunited with Mike Connors, George Barris, and Mannix stuntman Dick Ziker.\nAnother article on the famous Dart was published in the October 2011 issue of Mopar Action magazine. An article in the New York Times (July 22, 2012) included information on the 1968 Mannix Dart and a recent photo of Mike Connors with the car. The Mannix Dart was also mentioned on Sirius/XM Radio's \"60s on 6\" channel by disc jockey Mike Kelly.\nSeason 3 \u2013 1969 Dodge Dart GTS 340 convertible \"kustomized\" by George Barris to replicate the 1968 Dart: This car was totalled in a wreck soon after being sold, following its use on the series.\nSeason 4 \u2013 1970 Plymouth Cuda 340 dark green convertible\nSeason 5 \u2013 1971 Plymouth Cuda convertible, actually, three 1971s (all dark green with green interiors and black soft tops), were supplied by Chrysler Corporation, and all had differently sized (318, 340, 383) engines. One was wrecked, but later repaired. One episode the hood is raised, dynamite discovered, and the air cleaner reads 383.\nSeason 6 \u2013 1973 Plymouth Cuda convertible (actually two of the 1971 cars updated with 1973 grilles, headlamps, front fenders, front/rear bumpers, and tail lights)\nSeason 7 \u2013 1974 Dodge Challenger 360 Coupe: Two were built especially for the show, and had every available option installed, including the rare factory sunroof. Mild Barris customizing included Cragar S/S 15-inch chrome wheels, G60x15 Goodyear radial tires, and an upper body pinstripe.\nSeason 8 \u2013 Chevrolet Camaro LT, and a red 1975 Chevrolet Impala 2 door with a white convertible.\nPeggy Fair's cars were less prominent, but in seasons two through eight, they included a Simca 1000, Simca 1204 hatchback, Dodge Colt hardtop, and finally a Chevrolet Vega hatchback.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nFor his work on Mannix, Mike Connors was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning once, and for four Emmy Awards. Gail Fisher was nominated for four Emmy Awards, winning once, and for three Golden Globe Awards, winning twice.\nThe series was twice nominated for the Emmy Award for Best Dramatic Series, and four times for the Golden Globe Award, winning once. In 1972, writer Mann Rubin won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the episode \"A Step in Time\".\n\n\n== Music ==\nLalo Schifrin composed the music for the series. The theme \"Mannix\", with the B-side \"End Game\", was released as a single in 1969.\n\n\n== Royalties lawsuit ==\nIn May 2011, Connors filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Paramount and CBS Television Studios, claiming that he was never paid royalties from the Mannix series. With the release of the series on DVD, the case was later settled out of court in November of that year.\n\n\n== DVD releases ==\nCBS Home Entertainment (distributed by Paramount) has released all eight seasons of Mannix on DVD in Region 1.\nOn May 9, 2017 CBS DVD released Mannix- The Complete series on DVD in Region 1.\nIn Region 4, Shock has released the first three seasons on DVD in Australia.\n\n\n== Syndication ==\nCBS Television Distribution holds the distribution rights for Mannix, but does not offer the complete series (only 130 episodes) for local stations. Portions of season seven and the entire first and final seasons are not offered.\nThe show has also aired in its entirety on Heroes & Icons and currently airs on MeTV.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMannix on IMDb\nMannix at TV.com\nDVD review of series and production history",

            "content": "4257 Ubasti, provisional designation 1987 QA, is a stony asteroid, classified as near-Earth object of the Apollo group and as Mars-crosser, approximately 1.5 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American astronomer Jean Mueller at the Palomar Observatory in California on 23 August 1987. The asteroid was named for Bastet \u2013 also known as Baast, Ubaste or Ubasti \u2013 the Egyptian goddess of cats.\n\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\nUbasti orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9\u20132.4 AU once every 2 years and 1 month (772 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.47 and an inclination of 41\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. Due to its high eccentricity, Ubasti is also a Mars-crossing asteroid. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation, as no precoveries were taken and no prior identification had been made.\n\n\n=== Close approaches ===\nAs a near-Earth object, Ubasti has a low Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 0.1714 AU (25,600,000 km), which corresponds to 66.8 lunar distances (LD). This distance, however, is too large to make it a potentially hazardous asteroid (0.05 AU; less than 20 LD).\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nUbasti is an assumed stony S-type asteroid.\n\n\n=== Rotation period ===\nAs of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of Ubasti has been obtained and its rotation period remains unknown. However, the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Asteroid Photometric Survey has measured the body's brightness variation caused by its rotation, which gave a maximum of 0.36 magnitude. This indicates that the body has a somewhat non-spherical shape.\n\n\n=== Diameter and albedo ===\nAccording to the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, Ubasti measures 1.30 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.376, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 1.96 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.9.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nThis minor planet was named after Egyptian goddesses Bastet, who was originally the goddess of warfare, equated with the lioness war goddess, but later transformed into a major protector deity represented as a cat. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 21 November 1991 (M.P.C. 19336). The discoverer dedicated this asteroid to her beloved companion, Pepper Cat (1974\u20131991).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAsteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info)\nDictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books\nAsteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend\nDiscovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center\n4257 Ubasti at the JPL Small-Body Database \nClose approach \u00b7 Discovery \u00b7 Ephemeris \u00b7 Orbit diagram \u00b7 Orbital elements \u00b7 Physical parameters",

            "content": "Public art in the City of Sydney in New South Wales, Australia includes a wide range of works across a range of genres and for a range of purposes or combination of purposes. Some are purely artistic, some are commemorative, some are both. Some are monuments or memorials; some are also fountains and some are site-specific and in some buildings, such as Australia Square and Grosvenor Place by Harry Seidler and Aurora Place by Renzo Piano, the art is a component of the architect's intentions. The City of Sydney has a Public Art Policy. Conservation work is carried on from time to time to maintain the works.\nThe materials used vary widely but include traditional marble (such as in Touchstone) and bronze (such as in the Archibald Fountain) as well as steel (such as in New Constellation and I Stay), concrete (such as in I Wish and Barrel Roll) and newer materials like aluminium (such as in Vine and Morpho). In the 21st century, kinetic, musical, and conceptual works began to appear.\nNotable sculptors from around the world are represented in works on public display in Sydney. For example, Bertram Mackennal and Bronwyn Oliver were Australian; Gilbert Bayes and Henry Moore were British; Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard and Henri Alfred Jacquemart were French; Alexander Calder and Jenny Holzer are American; Kan Yasuda and Jun'ya Ishigami are Japanese.\nSome memorials (such as the Levy Drinking Fountain) are in the form of a fountain; others (such as William Dalley) are in the form of a portrait statue. The Lawson Memorial commemorates a writer; John Christie Wright Memorial Fountain commemorates a sculptor; the Dobell Memorial commemorates a painter, the Morshead Fountain commemorates a soldier; Il Porcellino commemorates surgeons. As well as memorials to individuals or groups, matters of importance to Sydney such as navigation and the environment are also commemorated. The bronze portraits of James Cook, Arthur Phillip and Matthew Flinders also pay tribute to their skills in exploration and navigation.\nRecurring themes include flora, children and classical or abstract allusion. Local flora is represented by sculptures such as Veil of Trees, Edge of the Trees and Into the Trees II. Busby's Bore takes water as its subject; indigenous fauna is interpreted in Dancing Brolgas and domesticated animals in Trim, Islay and Mare and Foal. The lives and importance of children are acknowledged in the Tank Stream Fountain, Windlines, Youngsters and the memorial to Hans Christian Andersen. Some (such as The Offerings of Peace and The Offerings of War) employ classical references to convey an abstract meaning; others (such as Research) use abstracted forms to convey an idea.\n\n\n== Works ==\nThe list below is of works whose purpose is at least partly artistic. Excluded from the article's scope are objects and installations that are primarily water features, such as the fountains in Martin Place and in the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House; purely memorial objects such as the obelisk of botanist Allan Cunningham in the Royal Botanic Garden; the many works of public art in greater Sydney and its surrounding suburbs; and temporary exhibitions containing sculptures for sale such as those displayed in the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition or other public spaces like Barangaroo.\n\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\nCommissions for sculpture came from three main sources: the Church, the State and the private sponsor. In the later part of the nineteenth century, there was \"an active artistic relationship between Australia and Britain\".\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nBy the twentieth century, the \"basic traditional concepts of sculpture were challenged and radically undermined\" giving rise to modern sculpture.\n\n\n=== Twenty-first century ===\nThe 20th century sculptor Tom Bass described himself as \"a maker of totems \u2013 symbolic, widely recognisable forms that embody social, cultural and spiritual meanings for a community \u2013 for a city, a corporate client or humanity in general\", however, noted Sydney art critic John McDonald critic has commented that \"only nowadays our malaise is cultural illiteracy.\" In the twenty-first century, citizens and viewers of public art no longer share a common theology and world-view nor a \"general grasp of symbolism and numerology\". The absence of such a \"shared cultural lexicon\" means that sculptors have had to master more than form, medium, composition and technique to create meaning with their works.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nSculpture by the Sea\nList of public art in Brisbane\nList of public art in the City of Westminster\nList of public art in the City of London\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBooth, Chris, Edward Lucie-Smith, Gregory O'Brien and Ken Scarlett (2001) Sculpture in Europe, Australia & New Zealand, Auckland, N.Z. : Godwit.

It is taught as part of the curriculum in Australia, North America, and Ireland for lifeguard and boating safety training. It involves essentially positioning one's knees together and hugging them close to the chest using one's arms. Furthermore, groups of people can huddle together in this position to conserve body heat, offer moral support, and provide a larger target for rescuers.\nThe HELP is an attempt to reduce heat loss enough to lessen the effect of hypothermia. Hypothermia is essentially a condition where bodily temperature drops too low to perform normal voluntary or involuntary functions. Cold water causes \"immersion hypothermia\", which can cause damage to extremities or the body's core, including unconsciousness or death.\nThe HELP reduces exposure of high heat loss areas of the body. Wearing a personal flotation device allows a person to draw their knees to their chest and arms to their sides, while still remaining able to breathe.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHuman positions\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "On 29 September 2013, gunmen from Boko Haram entered the male dormitory in the College of Agriculture in Gujba, Yobe State, Nigeria, killing forty-four students and teachers.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nBoko Haram was founded in 2002 to fight against the de-Arabization of Nigeria, which the group maintains is the root cause of criminal behaviour in the country. From 2009 to 2013, violence linked to the Boko Haram insurgency resulted in 3,600 deaths, including 1,600 civilians. In mid-May 2013, the federal government declared a state of emergency in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe States, as it aimed to end the Boko Haram insurgency. The resulting crackdown has led to the capture or killing of hundreds of Boko Haram members, with the remainder retreating to mountainous areas from which they have increasingly targeted civilians.\nSince 2010, Boko Haram has targeted schools, killing hundreds of students. A spokesperson said such attacks would continue as long as government continued to interfere with traditional Koran-based education. More than 10,000 children are no longer able to attend school due to attacks by the Boko Haram. Roughly 20,000 people fled Yobe State to Cameroon during June 2013 to escape the violence.\n\n\n== Attack ==\nGunmen from Boko Haram entered the college at 1 a.m. local time and opened fire on the students while they were asleep. Only the male sleeping quarters were targeted. Forty-two bodies were recovered by Nigerian soldiers while eighteen injured were transported to Damaturu Specialist Hospital. Two of the wounded later died.\nAccording to one survivor, the attackers drove into the college in two double-cabin pickup all-terrain vehicles. Some were wearing Nigerian military uniforms. A survivor said that nearly all of those killed were Muslims, as is the majority of the student body. This attack followed a 6 July 2013 attack at Mamudo outside Damaturu that killed 29 students and a teacher, some by burning alive, which left many schools in the area closed, and other attacks in the week following killed 30 more civilians. Boko Haram's name means \"Western education is sinful\".\nAfter the attacks, 1000 other students fled the college. The militants appeared to be based in the Gwoza Hills, finding shelter in caves from repeated military bombardments. An engagement with the Nigerian military left 100 militants and 16 soldiers dead. In Gwoza town, where some of the victims were being treated, militants drove away medical officers from the government hospital and set fire to three public schools, and the town was reported to be deserted. More than 30,000 people from the region fled to Cameroon and Chad.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The Remington Nylon 66 is a rifle manufactured by Remington Arms from 1959 to 1989. It was one of the earliest mass-produced rifles to feature a stock made from a material other than wood. Previously the 22-410 Stevens combination gun had been offered with a Tenite stock. The firearms market generally lacked experience with synthetic stocks, making the Nylon 66 a risky gamble for Remington. The model name was taken from the polymer of the same name.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the 1950s, Remington Arms was interested in designing a rifle that was cheaper to produce. After analysis, engineers determined that there were savings to be found in the production of the receivers and stocks of rifles. Thus Remington asked chemical engineers at DuPont to come up with a plastic that could replace both the wooden stock and the receiver. The specs given to DuPont called for a material that could be formed into any shape desired but that also had a high tensile-impact and flexural strength.\nAfter some research, DuPont came back to Remington with a compound they called Nylon Zytel-101. Zytel is DuPont's brand name for Nylon. This compound was ultimately used to produce the stock and receiver. After the Nylon 66 proved to be successful, Remington also marketed a series of bolt action and lever action rifles using Nylon stocks.\n\n\n== Design and features ==\n\nThe largely synthetic construction meant that the Nylon 66 could operate without any added lubricants. This made it popular in arctic regions, and indeed there have been many reports of indigenous peoples killing large animals, such as moose, with a .22 LR fired from a Nylon 66. Some have speculated that the light weight of the gun could potentially cause substandard accuracy in the field, but this does not seem to be a complaint from Nylon 66 shooters.\nThe Nylon 66 was fitted with leaf sights as well as a grooved receiver that could accommodate a mount for a telescopic sight. It was available in several colors, such as \"Mohawk Brown\", \"Apache Black\", and \"Seneca Green\".\nThe 77 Apache version has a bright green stock and was sold by K-Mart. The Seneca Green is a dull colored green and, in some lighting conditions, Seneca Green is difficult to distinguish from the more common brown. This version was also made with a detachable 10 round magazine which; in contrast to the standard version; was often unreliable. A copy of the tube magazine model was also made by FIE of Brazil, but many of these had quality control issues. The standard U.S. made tube magazine model could reliably cycle hundreds of rounds without cleaning, provided high velocity ammunition was used.\nBelow are some production numbers to assist with the rarity of each model:\n\n\n== Variants ==\nNylon 66MB: Mohawk Brown, 1959\u20131987 (Brown stock, blue steel receiver/barrel)\nNylon 66GS: Gallery Special 1962\u20131981 (.22 Short only, Brown stock, blue steel receiver/barrel). Shell deflector. Counter cable attachment on bottom of stock. A few were known to have been Apache Black.\nNylon 66SG: Seneca Green, 1959\u20131962 (dark green stock, blue steel receiver/barrel) 42,500 made\nNylon 66AB: Apache Black, 1962\u20131984 (Black stock, chrome receiver & barrel) 221,000 made.\nNylon 66BD: Black Diamond 1978\u20131987 (Black stock, blue/black steel barrel and receiver cover) 19012\u2013473710. These 1967\u20131968 serial numbers were located on the bottom of the barrel about 3\" back from the muzzle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRemington Model History\n\"Complete History and Development of the Remington Nylon 66\".

Often, punjene tikvice (stuffed squashes) and punjene paprike (stuffed peppers) are made together, as a mixed dish.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name in various languages generally means literally \"stuffed squash\": Croatian: Punjene tikvice; Serbian: Punjene tikvice; Serbian Cyrillic: \u041f\u0443\u045a\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0435; Albanian: Kungulleshka t\u00eb mbushura; Macedonian: \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438; Bulgarian: \u041f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438; Greek: \u0393\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03c5\u03b8\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 ; Turkish: Kabak dolmas\u0131; kousa mahshi Arabic: \u0643\u0648\u0633\u0627 \u0645\u062d\u0634\u064a\u200e / ALA-LC: k\u016bs\u0101 ma\u1e25sh\u012b.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nIn the Levant, this dish is flavoured with mint and garlic. In Cyprus, the flowers of the marrow are also stuffed.\nThe cultivar is called \"Cousa\" in Robinson and Decker-Walters (1997) p. 77: \"Some summer squash cultivars, e.g. the vegetable marrows (Cucurbita pepo) are consumed when almost mature. In the Middle East, nearly mature fruits of 'Cousa' are stuffed with meat and other ingredients, then baked\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of stuffed dishes\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "H. Beaumont Small (1831-1919) was a Canadian civil servant and an early naturalist who authored a number of books on forestry, minerals, animals, botany, and tourism.\nBorn in Market Bosworth, Leicestershire, England on October 31, 1831, he was the son of the Rev. Nathaniel Pomfret Small and Catherine Lee. He was born after his mother was gored by a bull. She died one hour after delivering her son.\nReceiving his first degree from King's College London in 1850, he went on to attend Lincoln College, Oxford, graduating in 1853. Seeing the opportunities Canada offered in the field of Natural History, he emigrated there shortly after obtaining his degrees.\nHe later relocated to the United States to become a Classical Professor at a military college in what today is Ossining, New York. After spending two years in this capacity, he continued on in the U.S. being a private tutor for a time in New York, and then serving in the United States Sanitary Commission in Virginia during the American Civil War.\nAbout the time his first book was published in 1865, he returned to Canada and entered into civil service. In 1868, he joined the Marine and Fisheries Department shortly after its formation. In 1870 he was appointed private secretary to the Hon. Christopher Dunkin, Minister of Agriculture. After Dunkin resigned as Minister in 1871, H. Beaumont Small went on to hold various appointments within the Department of Agriculture, eventually being appointed Secretary of Agriculture in 1889.\nPersonally, H. Beaumont Small married Henrietta Falle on June 20, 1853, and the couple had five children, including their eldest son, Dr. Henry Beaumont Small.\nH. Beaumont Small died on February 6, 1919 in Bermuda and is buried there.\n\n\n== Partial Listing of Published Works ==\nAnimals of North America, Mammals (1864)\nAnimals of North America, Fresh Water Fish (1865)\nThe Canadian Handbook and Tourist's Guide, Etc.

            "content": "Hutton is a village and civil parish in Lancashire, England. It is located 3 miles (4.8 km) south west of Preston, in the South Ribble borough and parliamentary constituency. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 2,277.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe village's name was variously recorded as Hoton in 1201, Hutton and Hooton in the 16th century. After the Norman Conquest Hutton was part of the Penwortham fee acquired by Roger son of Orm, (Roger de Hoton). Helias, (Ellis) the son of Roger de Hoton granted three carucates of land in \"Hottun,\" in \"Leylondeschire,\" without any reservation to Cockersand Abbey. He also made grants to Burscough Priory and Penwortham Priory. Lytham Priory had lands in the township. In about 1200 there was a chapel at a place called Ulvedene but nothing is known of its later history. Cockersand records from 1450 to 1537 show that the manor, its mills and a large part of the land were let to tenants. After the Dissolution in 1546 the manor was granted to Lawrence Rawstorne for \u00a3560 and descended through that family until the 20th century.\nIn the Hearth tax of 1666 there were 58 hearths to be taxed, the three largest houses had three hearths each. Hutton Hall was built in the 17th century and a free grammar school was built here.\nThe parish was part of Preston Rural District throughout its existence from 1894 to 1974. In 1974 the parish became part of South Ribble.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe village is bypassed by the A59 Preston to Liverpool road, which gives the village good connections with Preston and Southport. The village once had a railway station on the Southport to Preston line, which shut in the 1960s. This station was known as New Longton and Hutton railway station. The station was situated in New Longton but served Hutton.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHutton was a township of over 2,700 acres in the parish of Penwortham in the hundred of Leyland on the Ormskirk to Preston road. Much of the land is low lying on the south bank of the River Ribble and the village is situated to the east on land above the 50 feet level. The centre of the village is to the west of the A59 road and to the east is the location of the Lancashire Constabulary headquarters, which was built on the site of Hutton Hall.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nThere are several old houses and farmhouses in Hutton, some of which are Listed buildings. They include Hutton Manor Farmhouse dated 1690 and Rawstorne House which was the parish workhouse of 1827 which has a plaque that states, \"This Work House was erected in the year 1827 at the Expense of the Tax payers of the Township of Hutton. The Foundation & Area consisting of 1106 square yards. Given by Law Rawstorne Esq.\"\nHutton Grammar School is the most notable building in the village. The Hutton Police Headquarters on the eastern side of the A59 road at Hutton roundabout was built on the site of Hutton Hall. The hall's front gate posts remain in situ. The parkland is used as football pitches for the police headquarters.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHutton Church of England Grammar School in the village has been in existence since the 16th century and is now a comprehensive school.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nListed buildings in Hutton, Lancashire\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Hutton, Lancashire at Wikimedia Commons",

            "content": "Mother Earth is the second studio album by Dutch symphonic metal band Within Temptation. Originally released on 24 December 2000 in the Netherlands, and 21 August 2001 in other parts of Europe, it quickly became a success in the band's heartland, reaching platinum status in the Netherlands and Germany in addition to achieving TMF Awards in both the Netherlands and Belgium. As of 2011, the album reportedly sold 800,000 copies.\nThe album was licensed to be released in Germany and neighboring countries through GUN Records in January 2003 as a special extended edition with four bonus tracks. The same edition reached the United Kingdom through Sanctuary Records with a release in September 2004. The album was re-released by Roadrunner Records on 28 September 2007, with bonus live tracks.\nOn 5 August 2008, Mother Earth along with The Silent Force was released in the United States on Roadrunner Records.\n\n\n== Recording ==\nBy 1999 the band had built their own studio and had begun recording demos for the Mother Earth album there. The album itself was recorded in Studio RS29 in Waalwijk, the Netherlands. Oscar Holleman, who had produced and engineered The Dance, was again producer and one of the sound engineers was Stephen van Haestregt, future drummer for the band. Sharon recalls that \"I had a day for each song, which is still not very much, but you can try out things. We also did some demos before the recordings, so there you can check if you like or dislike parts of a song, and so you have more time when it comes to recording\". Ayreon's Arjen Lucassen provided the guitar solo for the track \"Dark Wings\".\n\n\n== Music style ==\nThe sound of Mother Earth was a departure for the band. In a 2008 interview with Faceculture, Sharon states that Mother Earth was \"a little bit older, a little bit more knowledgeable about how we wanted to sound, even then, of course you grow, so we had a better picture of how we wanted to sound. We didn't want to have the grunt vocals anymore. We felt like everyone was using that as a gimmick, and we didn't want to have it in our music anymore because of that...and also we were very much enthralled by a movie at that time, Braveheart, which was very Celtic, and that's how our album became very Celtic because we were so in love with the soundtrack of the Braveheart movie. So inspired by that, the album came out that way...I still love that album very much...it came together in a very natural way. The songs were sometimes written in a day, it did take time to work it out more, the way it sounded in the end, but it was like the ideas and the whole concepts of certain songs were written mostly in one day, the chorus and the verses.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAllMusic rated the album 4 and a half stars, the reviewer calling it \"easily one of the best releases of 2001\", and praising it for its \"mature and confident sound\" and Sharon den Adel's \"elusive and intangible presence\", adding \"The rise of goth/prog metal seemed to reach a peak at the turn of the century, with an endless supply of bands offering their own spin on the subgenre. Only a handful of these bands seem to have anything interesting or unique to offer... With the release of Mother Earth, there was little doubt that the cream of the crop had indeed risen to the top... A landmark release that set new standards for creativity, musicianship, and taste \u2014 not just for goth/prog metal, but for any style of music.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll lyrics written by Sharon den Adel, except where noted; all music composed by Robert Westerholt, except where noted.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Within Temptation ===\nSharon den Adel \u2013 vocals\nRobert Westerholt \u2013 guitar, vocals on \"Mother Earth\", spoken words on \"The Promise\"\nMichiel Papenhove \u2013 guitar\nMartijn Westerholt - keyboards\nJeroen van Veen \u2013 bass\nIvar de Graaf \u2013 drums\n\n\n=== Additional musicians ===\nArjen Lucassen - guitar solo on the track \"Dark Wings\"\nRene Dissel - fretless bass guitar on the track \"Never-ending Story\"\nGuus Eikens \u2013 synthesizer, co-arrangements on \"Mother Earth\" and \"The Promise\"\nRen\u00e9 Merkelbach - additional keyboards, orchestral arrangements\nCaspar De Jonge, Hans Cassa, Melissa 't Hart, Yvonne Rooda - choir\n\n\n=== Production ===\nOscar Holleman - producer, engineer, mixing, mastering\nStephen van Haestregt - engineer\nAnthony van den Berg - executive producer\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Certifications and sales ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Anthony Grainger was shot and killed by an armed Greater Manchester Police officer in Culcheth, Cheshire on 3 March 2012. At the time, Grainger was unarmed. In January 2014 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that they would be prosecuting Chief Constable Peter Fahy under health and safety legislation over the shooting, and a full public inquiry into Grainger's death was announced in early 2016.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn September 2011, Grainger had been arrested and questioned regarding the suspected theft from a police officer of a memory stick containing unencrypted details of 1,075 police informants. Grainger was formally cleared in early January 2012 after police found no evidence connecting him to the memory stick. Despite this, several days after officially clearing him of suspicion, Greater Manchester Police launched Operation Shire, a covert surveillance operation monitoring Grainger and two associates.\n\n\n== Death ==\nGrainger was shot in the chest whilst sat in a stolen Audi with two other occupants. An armed policeman fired a single shot from a Heckler & Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbine. The bullet went through the windscreen, and entered Grainger's heart and both his lungs.\nThe other two occupants, along with a third person, were tried and cleared of plotting a robbery.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nAn inquest into the death was opened by Nicholas Rheinberg at Warrington Coroner's Court on 5 March 2012. The inquest was adjourned until an IPCC investigation was completed. The IPCC finished its investigation in July 2013, finding that the intelligence gathering under Operation Shire had been 'flawed', criticising the management of the armed police team sent in to apprehend Grainger, and concluding that the officer responsible for shooting Grainger 'may have a case to answer for regarding possible manslaughter'. These results were forwarded to the Crown Prosecution Service, who have the authority to decide whether or not to pursue a case, and the coroner. Jonathan Bridge, solicitor for Grainger's family, complained that the investigation had been leaked, without being shown to the family.\nThe CPS decided that the armed policeman who fired the shot would not be prosecuted. They decided that it would be unlikely a jury would find him guilty due to perceived threat. A CPS spokesman alleged that Greater Manchester Police failed to prepare properly for the operation, which left people at risk. Chief Constable Peter Fahy was charged under Health and Safety at Work Act as he was the corporation sole for Greater Manchester Police. The police force faced an unlimited fine if found guilty.\nHowever, in January 2015, William Boyce QC, at Liverpool Crown Court accepted an 'abuse of process' argument from the defence, who had argued that evidence which needed to be disclosed in open court in order for the defendant (Fahy) to have a fair trial would not be in the public interest and it would prejudice future Greater Manchester Police operations.\nThe CPS had no choice but to accept the judge's decision and drop the case against the Greater Manchester Police.\n\n\n== Public inquiry ==\nIn March 2016, then-Home Secretary Theresa May announced that the inquest into Grainger's death would be converted into a statutory public inquiry with greater investigative and legal powers. The public inquiry, officially opening in January 2017 with a preliminary hearing in November 2016, is to be led by Judge Teague, who was appointed coroner of the original inquest. The conversion from inquest to inquiry will enable all relevant evidence, including confidential police documents previously deemed too sensitive, to be considered.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of people killed by law enforcement officers in the United Kingdom\nPolice use of firearms in the United Kingdom\nDeath of Jean Charles de Menezes\nDeath of Mark Duggan\nDeath of Azelle Rodney\nDeaths after contact with the police\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Never Let Me Go is a 2010 British dystopian romantic drama film based on Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel of the same name. The film was directed by Mark Romanek from a screenplay by Alex Garland. Never Let Me Go is set in an alternative history and centres on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy portrayed by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield respectively, who become entangled in a love triangle. Principal photography began in April 2009 and lasted several weeks. The movie was filmed at various locations, including Andrew Melville Hall. Never Let Me Go was produced by DNA Films and Film4 on a US$15 million budget.\nPrior to the book's publication, Garland had approached the film's producers\u2014Andrew Macdonald and Andrew Reich\u2014about a possible film, and wrote a 96-page script. The producers initially had trouble finding an actress to play Kathy. Mulligan was cast in the role after Peter Rice, the head of the company financing the film, recommended her by text message while watching her performance in An Education. Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as it had long been a wish of hers to have the opportunity to play the part. The film's message and themes were the factors that attracted Garfield to become a part of the film.\nNever Let Me Go premiered at the 37th annual Telluride Film Festival in September 2010, where the audience responded positively to its message. The film was also screened at festivals including the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival, and the 54th London Film Festival which it opened. The film was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures to cinemas in the United States on 15 September 2010, where it was given a limited release. It opened on 14 January 2011 in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Never Let Me Go opened at four theatres, grossing over US$111,000 during its first weekend. The movie got off to a better start in its first weekend in the UK, earning \u00a3625,000 and taking ninth place at the box office.\nNever Let Me Go earned $9.5 million at the box office and an additional $1.89 million in DVD sales revenue. Never Let Me Go was met with generally positive reviews from film critics, with most reviewers praising the cast's performances.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film begins with on-screen captions explaining that a medical breakthrough in 1952 has permitted the human lifespan to be extended beyond 100 years. It is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H as she reminisces about her childhood at a boarding school called Hailsham, as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The first act of the film depicts the young Kathy, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spending their childhood at Hailsham in 1978. The students are encouraged to create artwork, and their best work gets into The Gallery run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day, a new teacher, Miss Lucy, quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be organ donors and will die, or \"complete\", in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is sacked by the headmistress, Miss Emily, for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes, Kathy falls in love with Tommy, but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.\nIn the second act, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages on a farm in 1985. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of \"deferral\" \u2013 a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and jealousy causes Kathy and Ruth to break their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a \"carer\" \u2013 a clone who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends.\nIn the third and final act, in 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many clones gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and drive to the sea. There, Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of \"deferral\" are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the operating table shortly afterward.\nKathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the \"all but human\" clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy dying on the operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in voice-over whether her fate is really any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, \"we all complete\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\nCarey Mulligan as Kathy H\nIsobel Meikle-Small as young Kathy\n\nKeira Knightley as Ruth C\nElla Purnell as young Ruth\n\nAndrew Garfield as Tommy D\nCharlie Rowe as young Tommy\n\nSally Hawkins as Miss Lucy\nCharlotte Rampling as Miss Emily\nNathalie Richard as Madame\nDomhnall Gleeson as Rodney\nAndrea Riseborough as Chrissie\n\n\n== Themes ==\nDirector Mark Romanek has said that, as in the novel, everyone has to uncover their relationship to our own mortality; we have two options: either go against it, or try to figure out a way around it like the character Tommy does. Romanek hoped the audience of Never Let Me Go would be reminded of what is important: love, behaviour, and friendships. He recalled an email a person had written to him: \"I saw your film and it made me cry and I haven't reacted to a film emotionally like that in years. And I called my father, cause I realized I hadn\u2019t spoken to him in 3 weeks and I told him how much I love him and how much I appreciated what a good father he's been.\"\nAndrew Garfield believes the story of Never Let Me Go is about humans, and exploring \"what it is to have a soul, and how you prove what a soul is\"; he says he enjoys the way the film is a \"call to arms\" about the positives of life. He adds that its message could hopefully remind people that they have a choice when they arise in the morning whether to pursue their own choice of activities for the day, or to do what they should do or are obliged to do. Keira Knightley feels that the film's story is alarming, but has said that the film is \"more about humanity's ability to look the other way\". \"You know in fact that if your morals can go out the window if you think you can survive in a certain way, whatever your morals may be\".\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nAlex Garland, a long-time friend of Ishiguro, asked the author for the rights to the novel before he had finished reading it. Before the novel was published in 2005, Garland had already written a script for a possible film. He gave the screenplay to two producers, Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich, and development started at that moment. \"We are delighted to be shooting this special project, which Alex Garland first brought to us before the book's publication in 2005.\" The script for the film was 96 pages long, and divided into chapters. Director Mark Romanek was originally attached to The Wolfman, but when he was dropped from that production for an unknown reason, he accepted the offer to work on Never Let Me Go. The movie was made into a dystopian drama. Romanek was glad to get the opportunity to shoot this film: \"From the moment I finished [reading] the novel, it became my dream to film it. Ishiguro's conception is so daring, so eerie and beautiful. Alex Garland's adaptation is sensitive and precise. The cast is perfect, the crew superb.\" The Seattle Times observed that the project was \"something of a departure\" for the novelist, noting that it merges Ishiguro's signature \"elegant prose with a decidedly science-fiction theme\".\nGarland, who has explored science fiction themes in some of his previous work, was a sounding board for ideas for the novel and an early reader of the book. Ishiguro stated that, despite Garland's screenwriting skills and previous experience with film, they did not discuss the idea of a film until after the novel was complete. \"I try not to think about things like that when writing a novel\u2014in fact, quite the reverse\", he stated. He said that he attempts to \"go for something... very interior, following thoughts and memories, something that I think is difficult to do on the screen, which is essentially a third-person medium.\" Thus he was surprised when Garland, after reading a complete version of the book, said he would like to try to adapt it. Ishiguro recalled that Garland wrote a draft very quickly and immediately asked of his opinion of it \"as a first go\". Ishiguro was very satisfied with Garland's screenplay\u2014which was changed very little from its initial draft to the filmed version\u2014and with the final film. When asked to compare the experience with that of The Remains of the Day, he acknowledged that both were more hands-on with this film. Romanek said that he did not make Never Let Me Go a science fiction film; rather, he was presenting a love story with fictional science context mixed in. He described the film as telling a \"love story where the science fiction is this subtle patina on the story.\" The filmmaker explained that had they done the film with \"science fiction-y things\", it would have been more openly, with props such as futuristic structures and devices.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nCarey Mulligan plays the narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant character who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who over the course of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic child to a wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three years ago she had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not \"bear the idea of anyone else\" portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought other people would be able to do a better performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would wait until she would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: \"Hire the genius Mulligan.\" When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a \"rare foresight\" in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. \"He just knew that she was it\", said Romanek.\n\nAndrew Garfield was given the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles to find a place in an environment which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, \"There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him.\" Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a \"dream to come true\". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character\u2014unable to contain his frustration\u2014erupts with a wail, was \"intense\" for him. \"I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out\". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.\nThe three lead characters do not have last names because \"they are not normal people\". Romanek believed that the three main characters act with great dignity. He noted that they are not materialistic or looking for power, but just desire to acknowledge their love for each other and stay close in their friendship. An example he mentioned was how Ruth tries to seek redemption by attempting to set right a big mistake she had made. What he found the most moving aspect of the film was the \"graceful place of acceptance that Kathy comes to at the end\". Child actors Isobel Meikle-Small, Ella Purnell, and Charlie Rowe play the younger versions of Never Let Me Go's three lead actors. Hawkins, who co-starred with Mulligan in An Education, had a supporting role as Miss Lucy, who is a teacher at an isolated English boarding school where the students slowly become aware of the fact that they are feared by people in the outside world. Charlotte Rampling portrays Miss Emily, a schoolmaster who presides over the orphanage at Hailsham. Richard was cast as an administrator, who is known as Madame. The character has been conducting an ongoing project that aims to analyse the students\u2019 characters and psychologies, which has been compared to treating them as if they were subjects in an experiment. Riseborough's casting in Never Let Me Go was announced in April 2009 by Screen Daily; she had a small role in the film.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nNever Let Me Go was given a production budget of US$15 million. Principal photography for the film started in April 2009 and lasted a few weeks. Production design was done by Mark Digby, and Adam Kimmel was assigned to cinematography. The commercial director was Duncan Reid, who works for Ingenious Media, and the film was shot by crewmembers of the English company DNA Films. On 8 May 2009, the production moved to Norfolk for filming. The beach at Holkham is also featured in the film. Knightley previously shot scenes at nearby Holkham Hall for her 2008 film The Duchess. A location on Hill Road In Clevedon was used, and a shop was converted into a travel agency. They also filmed on the beach and the Victorian pier in Clevedon. The pier is featured on the film poster and the cover of the rereleased book. A large property on the Bexhill-on-Sea seafront was used on 12 and 13 May 2009 to act as the exterior for the residence of Madame, where Tommy and Kathy go to apply for a deferral.\nAndrew Melville Hall in the University of St. Andrews was the setting for the Dover Recovery Centre. Nearly thirty film extras, film producers, and location scouts had to wait several hours for the sun to set so they could film the scenes there. The restaurant scene, which is featured in the trailer and in promotional screenshots, was shot in the Regent Restaurant and Coffee Lounge in Weston-super-Mare in April 2009. Chiswick Town Hall, a dark building in London, was also used as a shooting location. The scenes where the Hailsham assemblies were held was filmed at a school in Snaresbrook, called Forest School, in May 2009. Ham House, Richmond, was used for filming mostly exterior scenes at Hailsham School and a couple of interior scenes.\nRomanek described working with child actors and \"knowing that the first act of the film was going to have to be carried by 12-year-olds\" as probably the most difficult aspect of making the film. He said that most of the rehearsal schedule was devoted to ensuring that the first act would be good. At rehearsals, the film-maker would have the younger actors observe the older actors practise the first-act scenes. This had a double purpose: the older actors would have a memory of having played those scenes, while the child actors would get a better idea of how a more skilled actor would play their part. Romanek would then mix and match the actors (for example, Mulligan would do a scene with the child playing the younger Tommy). He also had them spend time together doing things like playing and talking. He took them to the school location and let them play games together so they could get a better idea of the layout of the place.\nAccording to Mulligan, a problem during the production was that her role required her to drive: at the time she did not know how to drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. \"I\u2019m really bad at it\", she explained. \"[I have] no hand and eye coordination.\" The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a private road, where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: \"It was difficult. She was eager and happy to do it because the role called for it. But even at her worst, Keira still looks astonishing\".\nWhen accessing the very deep emotions called for by her character, Mulligan stated, \"I really took my cue from the book\". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy was more of an observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that \"every time I was in a scene where I wasn\u2019t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience.\" The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel \"insulted or hurt\" in discussion.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nNever Let Me Go's score was composed by British composer Rachel Portman. She worked on Never Let Me Go's music for four months. Portman said that because of the film's sad themes, she wanted to \"put some hope\" and humanity into the music. It was important to her that there be a \"real emotional heartbeat in the midst of this story.\" Believing that a \"huge sweeping score\" would not have fit Never Let Me Go, she instead worked with a smaller orchestra of no more than 48 players. At the urgent request of the director and the producers, she tried other approaches, such as the use of a child's voice and what was described as a \"big finale cue.\" In the end, they went for a simpler and more subtle approach. Stating that most of the score was written for piano, strings and harp, with solos for violin and cello, she called her score something of a \"chamber piece\". \"If you use a solo instrument, it's like having a voice\", she says. \"It highlights the emotion.\" But, she adds, \"the violin is played with virtually no vibrato, because I didn't ever want it to sound sentimental\". She notes that \"for my own taste, I stay on the side of restraint, because I think it works better in film\". Her work on Never Let Me Go earned her a San Diego Film Critics Society Award for Best Score.\nThe song \"Never Let Me Go\" that Kathy listens to in the film is from a cassette tape Tommy gave her at Hailsham called Songs After Dark by Judy Bridgewater. The album and singer are fictitious, but \"Never Let Me Go\" was written by Luther Dixon and sung by Jane Monheit.\n\n\n== Promotion and release ==\n\nIn July 2010 Never Let Me Go was screened to film critics, who gave it generally positive reviews, with The Daily Telegraph calling the film's three leads \"brilliant\". Never Let Me Go premi\u00e8red at the 37th annual Telluride Film Festival, presented by the National Film Preserve. The festival began on 3 September 2010, running through Labor Day in a remote Colorado town. The Hollywood Reporter observed that the audience \"seemed to respond positively to the film's look at what makes us human and what defines a soul.\" The film was also part of the 35th Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) line-up during September 2010, and was screened along with 300 other films. According to Deadline Hollywood, Never Let Me Go was originally expected to have its world premiere at the 2010 Venice Film Festival in September, but Fox replaced it with Black Swan. They favored the TIFF over Venice, but eventually settled on the Telluride Film Festival.\nIn the same month, the film was screened during the 2010 Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas. Never Let Me Go opened the 54th London Film Festival on 13 October 2010, the same day as its European release date. Never Let Me Go was the second film based on an Ishiguro novel to open the festival, after Merchant Ivory\u2013Ismail Merchant's The Remains of the Day in 1993. Regarding the film's screening at the London Film Festival, Ishiguro said, \"It is a fantastic privilege, I feel very lucky. To some extent it is a showcase for British talent and it's a tremendous honour\". Describing Never Let Me Go as \"accomplished and imaginative\", Sandra Helborn, the London Film Festival Artistic Director, added that \"It combines impeccable film making, outstanding performances and a deeply moving story, and I couldn\u2019t wish for a stronger or more appropriate opening night\". That same month it was also screened in competition at Japan's Tokyo International Film Festival. Six screenings of the film were held in the Little Theatre at Western Michigan University between 17\u201319 December 2010.\nNever Let Me Go was scheduled for a limited release for select cities in the United States on 1 October 2010, but the date was later moved up to 15 September. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2011, and in France on 9 February 2011. As a forum of promotion for the film, Mulligan made guest appearances to introduce Never Let Me Go at movie theatre screenings, including at the Landmark Theatres and AMC Loews Lincoln Square. Upon the film's release at the Telluride Film Festival, a writer for the Los Angeles Times called the film an \"Oscar wild card\". He believed its reviews were \"likely to be split between those who consider the film a bleak masterpiece and others who find it straining so mightily for aesthetic perfection that it fails to provide a gripping narrative.\" The Globe and Mail called Never Let Me Go one of 2010's \"big noise\" films. In the United States, Never Let Me Go was released on DVD on 1 February 2011. By 6 February, it had sold 44,911 units (amounting to US$628,305 in consumer revenue) and was the 17th-best selling DVD for that week. the DVD sales revenue stands at US$1,886,997.\n\n\n== Box office ==\nIn its opening weekend in the United Kingdom, between 11\u201313 February 2011, it took ninth place at the box office. Playing on 265 screens, it took in an estimated UK\u00a3625,000, which was seen as a disappointment to the British press. In Never Let Me Go's next week, it had a 45% decrease in revenue, taking in about UK\u00a3338,404. Never Let Me Go has made a total of \u00a39,455,232 worldwide.\nNever Let Me Go was released to four movie theaters in its opening weekend in the United States, with an additional one hundred-sixty-three theatres added to its theatrical run later on. The film became the number one-screening at these four theatres on its opening day, and grossed slightly over US$44,500 from those select screenings. In its opening weekend, the film made over US$111,700, averaging US$30,250 per theatre, taking 42nd place at the box office. In its succeeding week, revenues for Never Let Me Go saw an 117% increase, making about US$241,000, with an average of nearly US$9,500 per theatre. It was the 28th top grossing film at the box office for that week. By its third week of release, the film suffered a revenue decrease to around US$188,000, despite being screened at more theatres than the previous week. After one month of release, it pulled in US$350,000, increasing nearly 90 percent from its previous weekend.\nAccording to a news piece published by the Los Angeles Times on 21 October, by Never Let Me Go's fifth week of release it had been labeled an \"undeniable disappointment\" commercially. The publication noted that when its release widened to over 200 theatres the previous weekend its per-theatre average was so low that its distributor decided to cut its screens in the succeeding weeks. Based on answers from film experts and executives for Fox Searchlight, there were five factors to why the film commercially disappointed: its timing, airing too early in the year when lighter summer fare is still popular; a novel that is particularly difficult to adapt; mixed reviews from critics; its depressing tone; and its lack of appeal to male viewers. In the following weeks Never Let Me Go began to gross under US$100,000 per weekend, going on to earn US$2.5 million in the US by the second week of December.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\nNever Let Me Go received generally positive reviews from critics, with the cast's performances being praised. The critical consensus on the film-critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes states that \"Mark Romanek has delivered a graceful adaptation that captures the spirit of the Ishiguro novel \u2013 which will be precisely the problem for some viewers.\" It holds a 71% rating based on 164 reviews. David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph saluted the film, applauding the production and the performances of its supporting cast. Saul Austerlitz, a correspondent to the Boston Globe, felt that the film struck a \"mournful note\" and believed that certain images in the film, such as a tree in an empty field, \"possess a haunting power directly lifted from the best of Romanek's video work\", while respecting the themes in Ishiguro's novel.\nThe Hollywood Reporter critic Jay A. Fernandez said that Never Let Me Go was an engaging film, but he thought that its overall impact was not as emotionally devastating as the book. Cleveland Magazine's Clint O'Connor strongly approved the acting performance of Garfield, and Eric Kohn from IndieWire praised the script and the photography of Kimmel and Garland.\nChris Knight of the National Post wrote that the film was able to capture the wistfulness and the unpredictable tone of Ishiguro's novel, but added that it \"spills the beans much sooner\". Mark Jenkins of NPR called Never Let Me Go a \"remarkably successful adaptation\" of Ishiguro's book, but acknowledged that Romanek and Garland \"do make a few missteps\", which were mostly the result of the limitations imposed by turning the novel's contents into a film. Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman described the film as feeling like a \"period piece\" and rated it a C+. Reuters's Stephen Farber called the film a disappointment, because although it was \"expertly acted, impeccably photographed, intelligently written\" and \"even intermittently touching\", Never Let Me Go is \"too parched and ponderous to connect with a large audience\". He said the film should have laid out more completely the logic of its parallel universe, such as the cloning process. He found its theme of the dangers of medical experimentation \"rather tired\".\nSlant writer Ed Gonzalez gave the film a two- out of four-star rating, saying the characters' actions do not feel \"appropriately warped\" while the interactions between the teachers and students is not \"at all rife with the what-are-they-thinking-about-us mystery of the book\". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com wrote that Romanek \"does so many difficult things beautifully in this movie\". He thought the film carried a reminder that life is short regardless of how long it lasts rather than a \"lecture about the horrors of human history\". Tom Preston from The Guardian described Mulligan and Garfield's acting as solid, while commenting that Knightley's emotional performances are occasionally jarring. He further wrote that although Never Let Me Go finely demonstrated subtlety, its screenplay could have been written with less compression in some parts. Writing in Newsweek, Louisa Thomas praised the film for its beauty and its performances but declared that \"there's something just missing here.\"\nMarshall Fine of The Huffington Post noted that like the novel, the film is difficult to embrace. He said that the film does work on a \"suspense level\", due to Romanek's creating a \"quiet, leisurely pace that would not be out of place in a yoga class\". He stated that he \"no doubt was aiming for an eerie, Children of the Damned vibe, except that it's the children who are damned\". The writer concluded that Never Let Me Go's final result is a \"staid, lifeless tale that never talks about what it's about, or at least not enough to provoke deep thoughts on the subject.\" Film critic Rex Roberts of Film Journal International thought that the film was moderately surprising given Romanek and Garland's previous work, saying that they \"show real affinity for the subtle shades of resignation and quiet desperation that characterize Isighuro's [sic] prose and, as would be expected, accentuate the unsettling eeriness that pervades Never Let Me Go\". Roberts felt that Mulligan and Knightley were not convincing in portraying their ages until the last third of the movie.\nThe Canadian Press's Christy Lemire stated that the film was a \"gorgeous, provocative look at humanity\" and observed that like its characters, the film \"demands much of its audiences emotionally\". She concluded that Never Let Me Go is worth the investment. The Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan thought that the film was \"passionate about deliberation and restraint\" and believed that the latter may not appeal to all audiences. Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, gave the film a negative review, declaring \"never was a movie so bleak and empty\". He claimed that Never Let Me Go did not \"embrace the book's unrelentingly dark tones\", but rather wallowed in them. He commented that not even the cast's performance, particularly Garfield's, were enough to redeem the film.

It was first performed by the American Composers Orchestra conducted by Lukas Foss in Alice Tully Hall, New York City, on January 29, 1979. The piece was later awarded the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for Music.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing a 1991 revival of the piece, the music critic Allan Kozinn of The New York Times wrote:\n\nThe piece begins with a nonspecific shimmer and proceeds spacily for several moments before its strands begin to coalesce. When they do, the results are violent eruptions of percussion, brass and string writing, sometimes in patches so dense as to become a toneless aggregate. Invariably, haunting, lyrical passages emerge from these thickets. And in the work's final moments, the sounds of a glass harmonica and the orchestra's gentle vocalizing return the 15-minute work to the haziness of its starting point.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was educated at Summerhill College at Athlone, and at Queen's College Galway which he entered in 1861 to study medicine. He was elected auditor of the college's Literary and Debating Society for the 1866-1867 session. Ward left Galway to continue his medical studies at Dr Steevens' Hospital in Dublin, under the auspices of the Catholic University. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in 1868, and returned to Galway as Demonstrator of Anatomy at the Queen's College. Ward resigned from this post in 1870 on foot of a controversy surrounding the Literary and Debating Society, then under the auditorship of his brother, Peter Ward.\nLeaving Galway, Ward took up a position as surgeon to the Infirmary for Children at Buckingham Street in Dublin, and later became curator of the Catholic University Anatomical Museum. He was election agent for his college contemporary Frank Hugh O'Donnell when O'Donnell contested the Galway constituency in the 1874 general election and, when O'Donnell was unseated by the courts, Ward successfully contested the ensuing by-election as an agreed Home Rule League candidate, winning with 726 votes to the Liberal candidate's 288. Ward represented Galway in the House of Commons until the 1880 election when, on the dissolution of Parliament, his whereabouts could not be established; in his place, his friend and another school and university contemporary T.P. O'Connor contested and won the Galway seat. Writing in 1929, O'Connor, who had been in the House of Commons for 49 years, said of Ward that 'There have been many curious figures in the House of Commons, and many tragedies of which the public know little, but assuredly never was there a stranger Member than this old friend of mine'. He provided a detailed character portrait, and also commented that in 1874 Ward found himself a Member of Parliament 'very much to his surprise, also to his dissatisfaction'.\nWard accepted an offer of a position on the Government Medical Service in Demerara in 1881. He died shortly after arriving in the colony, on 17 June 1881.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\"The New Member for Galway\", The Times (London), 14 July 1874\nObituary, The Times (London), 13 July 1881\nNorman Atkinson, Irish Education: A History of Educational Institutions, Dublin, Allen Figgis, 1969\nT.

            "content": "Charles Reed Bishop (January 25, 1822 \u2013 June 7, 1915) was an American businessman, politician, and philanthropist in Hawaii. Born in Glens Falls, New York, he sailed to Hawaii in 1846 at the age of 24, and made his home there, marrying into the royal family of the kingdom. He served several monarchs in appointed positions in the kingdom, before its overthrow in 1893 by Americans from the United States and organization as the Territory of Hawaii.\nBishop was one of the first trustees of and a major donor to the Kamehameha Schools, founded by his late wife's bequest to provide education to Hawaiian children. He founded Hawaii's first successful bank, now known as First Hawaiian Bank. Based on his business success, he also founded the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, named for his late wife.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nOn January 25, 1822, Charles Reed Bishop was born to Maria (Reed) and Samuel Bishop in Glen Falls, New York. His father was a toll collector for ship traffic on the Hudson River near the town. Charles' mother Maria died two weeks after giving birth to her next son, Henry. Their father Samuel Bishop died when Charles was four, and the boy was taken in by his grandfather on his 125-acre (0.51 km2) farm in Warrensburg. Charles Bishop worked on his grandfather's farm, learning how to care for sheep, cattle, and horses. While living with his grandfather, Bishop was baptized in a Methodist church.\nBishop spent his early years of education at a village school, and finished his formal schooling at 8th grade, as was customary for many boys in that period. Bishop was hired as a clerk and soon started working for Nelson J. Warren, who headed the largest mercantile company in Warrensburg.\nHe befriended William Little Lee (1821\u20131857) from nearby Hudson Falls, then called Sandy Hill. Charles' paternal uncle Linus Bishop married Lee's sister Eliza. After attending Harvard Law School, Lee persuaded Bishop to go with him to the Oregon Territory for new opportunities.\n\n\n== In Hawaii ==\n\nThe two young men sailed for Oregon on the Henry out of New York City, leaving February 23, 1846. By October the ship had rounded Cape Horn and needed to stop in Honolulu for provisions. At this time, the islands were still governed by the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi, but numerous Americans were settling there for business opportunities and as missionaries. Lee was recruited to stay as the second western-trained lawyer in the Hawaiian islands; he was later appointed as the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Bishop decided to stay as well. He soon was hired by some Americans to sort out the failed land deal of Ladd & Co., which was the first major formal law proceeding. He next worked for the U.S. Consul.\nOn February 27, 1849 Bishop became accepted as a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He became an investor with Henry A. Peirce and Lee in a sugarcane plantation on the island of Kaua\u02bbi, near where the Ladd company had been somewhat successful. From 1849 to 1853 he served as Collector General of Customs.\nOn May 4, 1850 he married Bernice Pauahi P\u0101k\u012b, of the royal House of Kamehameha, despite the objections of her parents. Their private ceremony in the Royal School was not attended by her family. Within a year her father P\u0101k\u012b made peace with the marriage and invited the couple to live in the family estate called Haleakala.\nBishop formed a partnership with William A. Aldrich, selling merchandise to be shipped to supply the California Gold Rush. He became known as a trusted person with whom traders could deposit and exchange the various currencies in use at the time.\nIn 1853 Bishop was elected as representative to the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom.\n\n\n=== Bank ===\n\nOn August 17, 1858 Aldrich split off the shipping business. Bishop founded Bishop & Co. as the first chartered bank in the Kingdom. It is the second oldest bank west of the Rocky Mountains. On its first day it took in $4784.25 in deposits. By 1878 it outgrew its basement room and expanded to a two-story building. This structure is designated as a contributing property to the Merchant Street Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nIn 1895 Bishop sold the bank to Samuel Mills Damon (1841\u20131924), son of American missionary Samuel C. Damon (1815\u20131885). Over time the bank grew and in 1960 was renamed as First Hawaiian Bank, formalizing its role in state history.\n\n\n=== Service ===\nBishop served on the Privy Council for five Hawaiian monarchs from 1859\u20131891, and was appointed to the House of Nobles 1859\u20131886 by King Kamehameha IV. From 1869 to 1891, he served as an appointee to the Board of Education. During the brief reign of King Lunalilo, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from January 10, 1873 to February 17, 1874.\nBishop was one of the first trustees of and major donor to the Kamehameha Schools, founded at his late wife's bequest to provide education to Hawaiian children. He also was a founder of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, which he named after his late wife. Bishop hired William Tufts Brigham, whom he had met on a scientific visit in 1864 with Horace Mann Jr., to be the museum's first director. He also donated funds for buildings at the private Punahou School. Bishop was elected and served as president of the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce 1883\u20131885 and 1888\u20131894.\nAfter the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in 1893, Bishop left Hawaii in 1894 and settled in San Francisco, California. He became vice-president of the Bank of California, serving until his death on June 7, 1915. He stayed involved in his Hawaiian estate affairs from California. For example, he hired architects Clinton Briggs Ripley and Charles William Dickey to design a new building for the Bishop estate headquarters, and for Pauahi Hall on the Punahou School campus.\n\n\n== Death ==\nBishop died in 1915 at the age of 93. His ashes were returned to Hawaii and interred next to his wife's remains at the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii.\nA major street cutting through Bishop property in downtown Honolulu at 21\u00b018\u203232\u2033N 157\u00b051\u203238\u2033W was named Bishop.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBernice P.
