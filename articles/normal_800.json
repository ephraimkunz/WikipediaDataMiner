            "content": "The FBI Special Advisor Program is an internal consulting and leadership development rotational program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The group consists of recent graduates from the top Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs. FBI Special Advisors are primarily responsible for serving in an advisory capacity to the FBI Senior Executive team and completing \"management\" type of issues.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe FBI Special Advisor Program evolved from a 2002 effort by the FBI's Finance Division to recruit new talent from top business schools. Initially, one graduate of Harvard Business School was hired to work in the Director's Office. In 2003, another Harvard Business School graduate joined the FBI to work for the Chief Financial Officer. The work of these two merited the attention of the FBI's senior leadership and led to a proposal for a formal business school recruiting program. In 2007, executives from 25 FBI divisions participated in the three-year-old Special Advisor Program.\n\n\n=== Past responsibilities ===\nIn the past, the FBI Special Advisors have been responsible for:\nimplementing the balanced scorecard strategic planning tool at the FBI,\nrestructuring the 1000-employee Human Resources division to achieve improvements in productivity and customer service,\ncoordinating the development of an information technology (IT) system for managing crises and special events,\nre-engineering the background investigation process to improve time-to-hire for new FBI employees,\nleading a team to develop and implement a career path, training and development for the FBI\u2019s Intelligence Analyst workforce,\ndeveloping a leadership development strategy and succession planning model, and\nimplementing a consolidated contract for relocation services, resulting in a US$38 million savings\n\n\n== References ==\nKelman, Steve (14 August 2008). \"Kelman: Hiring outside of the box\".

            "content": "Smolenskoye Poozerye National Park (Russian: \u0421\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u041f\u043e\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435) (also Smolenskoe, or Smolensk Lakes) is a forest-wetland ecosystem of 35 lakes and surroundings in the northwest of Smolensk Oblast near the Russian border with Belarus. It is in the basin of the Daugava (called in Russian the \"Western Dvina\" River), about 40 miles (64 km) north of the city of Smolensk. The park was officially established in 1992. Since 2002, the park has been included in the international network of biosphere reserves. Administratively, the national park is shared between Demidovsky and Dukhovshchinsky Districts of Smolensk Oblast.\n\n\n== Topography ==\n\nThe park covers a region 55 kilometres (34 mi) (east-west) by 50 kilometres (31 mi) (north-south) over a flat network of low-lying rivers and lakes. The highest elevation is 248 metres (814 ft), the lowest is 167 metres (548 ft). They underlying landforms include gravel moraines and ridges, and flat floodplains. The two main rivers are the Yelsha and the Polovya. The largest lake is Lake Sapsho (3 km2), a glacial lake and major tourist draw to its resort town of Przhevalskoye. Areas of coverage have been estimated as 107,563 hectares (265,794 acres) of forest (about 75%), 16,240 hectares (40,130 acres) of bogs, 1,608 hectares (3,973 acres) of lakes, and 468 hectares (1,156 acres) of rivers.\n\n\n== Climate and ecoregion ==\nThe climate of Smolenskoye is \"\"Humid Continental Mild Summer, Wet All Year\" (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb), characterized by four distinct seasons, high variance between winter and summer temperatures, mild summers and long winters, and precipitation throughout the year. Days can be clear in winter when polar air masses are present, and in summer there are occasional thunderstorms. Average temperatures range from 17 F in January to +64 F in July. Annual precipitation averages 24.6 inches (62 cm).\nSmolenskoye is towards the eastern end of the \"Sarmatic mixed forests\" ecoregion (WWF ID#436), which runs from southern Sweden across the Baltic states and central eastern Europe (including Moscow) to the Ural Mountains. The ecoregion is a strip of low forests, lakes and wetlands, running from the Baltic Sea east to the Urals. Forest cover is typically mixed conifer and deciduous trees, with the unbroken tracts under pressure from agriculture.\nFor aquatic habitat, the park is in the \"Volga-Ural\" freshwater ecoregion (WWF ID#410), a region that is characterized in general by a high number fish species but relatively few endemics.\n\n\n== Plants ==\nThe park is designed to cover many different habits in a small, contiguous place. These habitats include pine forests, spruce forests, broad-leaf forests, bogs, sedge meadows along the banks for rivers and lakes, dry meadows, and water habitat itself. A review of tree cover percentages reported spruce (16%), pine (12%), birch (38%), aspen (13%), and black alder (6%).\n\n\n== Animals ==\nA census of animals in the park recorded 54 mammal species, 232 bird species, and 37 species of fish. In 2012, the World Wildlife Fund initiated a project entitled \"Conservation and restoration of rare bird species in large wetlands of Smolensk Lakeland National Park\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe territory of the Smolensk Lakes has been inhabited since ancient times, and archaeological remains are found throughout the park. The earliest flint tools date to the Mesolithic Age (7,000-8,000 BCE), there are 17 known Neolithic sites, and about 25 Bronze Age memorials. Since the fifth century AD, the culture of the area has been Slavic agricultural and timber-related. In modern times, 123 villages have been recorded in the region. The park includes a resort town, Przhevalskoye, on the shores of Lake Sapsho.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe park is developed with recreational facilities, including a popular spa \"Holy Well\", and an ancient settlement Verzhavska. Nature trails, bike trails, horse trials, and water tourist routes are maintained. There is a trail for children called \"Fairy tales of a Russian forest\", which features defense outposts and homes of folklore characters 'Baba-Yaga' and 'Leshy'. There are guided tours for bird-watching, historical-cultural site visits, and scientific education. The park administers 32 tourist shelters, and 30 guest houses. The park's administration estimates that there are 230,000-250,000 visitors per year, most of whom are local.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProtected areas of Russia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSmolensk Lakeland Entry - UNESCO-MAB Biosphere Directory",

In his career spanning 1984 to the present, Allison has worked mainly as a record producer and label owner.\nHe is also well-known amongst fans of the band Shack for having the only copy of their album Waterpistol following a studio fire allowing it to be released.\n\n\n== Early professional years - Sarm Studios, Fairlight programming (1984-1987) ==\nIn 1984, Allison fresh out of College was thrown into a hive of activity at Sarm Studios, London, home of Trevor Horn\u2019s own label ZTT, it was the height of Frankie Goes To Hollywood mania both in the studio and on the streets with the ubiquitous \u2018Frankie Says......\u2019 T-shirts. Regular artists in the studio were 80\u2019s icons Frankie Goes To Hollywood, George Michael, Pet Shop Boys, Art of Noise and Propaganda. In November 1984, Studio 1 at Sarm West was the venue for the recording of \"Do They Know It's Christmas\" by the members of Band Aid in support of relief efforts for the 1984\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia.\nAlthough working in the tech department Allison got to assist on a number of studio sessions and seeing the potential of new computer instruments such as the Fairlight and Synclavier, instruments that producers Trevor Horn and Steve Lipson were championing, Allison set about learning to programme these new \u2018gods\u2019 of the studio. He left Sarm and became a freelance Fairlight programmer working in London and Europe on music for a wide roster of clients including Iggy Pop, The Triffids, Spear of Destiny, Elkie Brooks and the Emmy award-winning TV series \u2018Kingdom of The Ice Bear\u2019.\n\n\n== Production career \u2013 The Wedding Present era (1987-1991) ==\nAllison got his first production break in 1987 producing The Wedding Present\u2019s \u2018My Favourite Dress\u2019 single. This immediately became an indie hit with John Peel championing and giving it a #6 entry in his 1987 Festive Fifty. Of the same year he produced the Wedding Present\u2019s debut album \u2018George Best\u2019 which racked up a further four song entries in the festive 50. The \u2018George Best\u2019 album and accompanying EP\u2019s were such an indie success that RCA snapped them up and Allison went onto produce their second album, 'Bizarro\u2019, which went on to sell 100,000 albums and garner a further five entries in John Peel's Festive Fifty of 1989. A UK singles chart entry at #33 for the song 'Kennedy' and the album \u2018Bizarro\u2019 itself reaching #22 in the UK album charts. Allison went on to produce other Peel favourites - The Flatmates (#2 indie hit with \u2018Shimmer\u2019), Pale Saints and Ned's Atomic Dustbin.\n\n\n== Production career \u2013 The Shack era (1991-1998) ==\nShowing his versatility as a producer Allison moved away from indie guitars and on to the psychedelic folk/rock of Liverpool band Shack and the album \u2018Waterpistol\u2019. Brothers Mick and John Head were a writing force to be reckoned with, influences ranged from classic pop to jazz and folk. Things didn\u2019t go too well, as Allison recalls: \u201cMick could never finish anything. I\u2019ve never worked with anyone like him, but he\u2019s a songwriting genius and one of the most gifted artists I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201d\nAllison recalls that Head would disappear for days on end during the recording, so he took drastic steps. \u201cI locked him in the studio and told him I wouldn\u2019t let him out until he\u2019d done five vocals. He was furious and wasn\u2019t used to working without a few drinks, but the results were amazing.\u201d And he says all this with genuine warmth; Head might have been a trial to work with, but he was capable of greatness. Just after the recording and mixing was completed in 1991, Star Street Studio burned down taking the masters of Head's opus with it. The Ghetto record label then folded which heralded the end of Shack. Since then no new material has been released by Head and little heard of him.\nAfter the recording Allison meanwhile had taken off to do his Jack Kerouac in the US and had with him his producer's copy DAT of 'Waterpistol' but in a cruel twist of fate had left it in his hire car. When he returned and learnt of the fire he miraculously managed to track it down through the hire car company. But everything lay dormant until German Indie Marina rang Leahy's office and said it wanted to release the album. So in 1995, one of 1991's best records was released, a tour-de-force of timeless pop songs that sounded as fresh as anything heard that year. Waterpistol became a cult classic with the likes of NME, Select, Q, Time Out, Vox, FHM, Uncut and others all championing it as a bona-fide classic.\nQ Magazine recently included it in the Greatest Album Stories Ever (April 2012).\nAllison went on to work with another Liverpool favourite The Real People. The track \u2018Believer\u2019 was a UK singles chart #38 entry produced by Allison. 1998 saw Allison producing the album \u2018Slain by Urusei Yatsura\u2019 by Glaswegian band Urusei Yatsura with song \u2018Hello Tiger\u2019 reaching #40 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\n\n== Production career \u2013 The Beta Band, Coldplay and Kinky Era (1998-present) ==\nThe Beta Band came to Allison\u2019s attention in 1998, thanks to Parlophone A&R Miles Leonard. Leonard was a Shack \u2018Waterpistol\u2019 fan. He asked Allison to produce the \u2018Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos\u2019 and \u2018The Patty Patty Sound\u2019 EP\u2019s, that were later included in their entirety on The Three E.P.'s UK album chart position #35 and this led to production work on the album \u2018The Beta Band\u2019 UK album chart position #18. Newly signed Beta Band stable mates Coldplay\u2019s early recordings were produced by Allison. \u2018Things got off to a productive start. The first track we worked on was \u2018High Speed\u2019, which ultimately proved good enough to make it onto the first album. Allison describes it thus: \u2018You\u2019ll notice it is quite a bit different to other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. To give it a slightly different perspective I guess, with the full willingness and understanding of the band. I thought \u2018High Speed\u2019 was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that were developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric\u2019. \u2018Don\u2019t Panic\u2019, \u2018See You Soon\u2019 and \u2018High Speed\u2019 were featured on \u2018The Blue Room (EP)' and \u2018High Speed\u2019 also featured on the Grammy award-winning album \u2018Parachutes\u2019 with the album reaching #1 on the UK Album Charts. Allison\u2019s version of \u2018Don\u2019t Panic\u2019 is a more atmospheric version than the one that appears on the album Parachutes. There is also a wonderfully atmospheric version of \u2018We Never Change\u2019 which has yet to see the light of day. In December 1999 looking for a new challenge Allison took off to Monterrey Mexico to produce the \u2018Juan Manuel\u2019 album for Latin America superstars \u2018Plastilina Mosh\u2019 signed to EMI Mexico. On his travels he discovered early Sonic360 signing and Mexican electro/funk/Latin artist Kinky, whose eponymous album was also produced by Allison. The album was nominated for a Latin and US Grammy at the 45th Grammy\u2019s.\n\n\n== Label owner Sonic360 (2000-present) ==\nChris Allison is Owner and CEO of music labels Sonic360, Sonic360, Inc., Sonic360 Music Publishing and Sonic360 Music Publishing America. Sonic360 is distributed by Fontana/Universal.\nAllison launched Sonic360 in June 2000. It excels in breaking new musical boundaries, predominantly but not exclusively marketing and promoting non-western artists to a western audience. Sonic360 has its headquarters in London and a subsidiary in the United States, (Sonic360 Inc).\nArtists that have signed to the label include Mexican electro-funk rock outfit Kinky. They signed an exclusive worldwide deal with Sonic360 in the summer of 2000. Kinky's eponymous debut album was nominated for the Best Rock Album award at the Latin Grammy's (2002) and Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album at the US Grammy's (2002). Their follow up album, Atlas was nominated for numerous awards, including Best Alternative Music Album at the Latin Grammy's (2004).\nIn August 2007, Sonic360 signed ex-Sudanese child soldier turned conscious hip-hop star Emmanuel Jal. Sonic360 hired the talents of Neal Pogue (Outkast, Talib Kweli) to additionally produce and mix the \u2018Warchild\u2019 album. It was followed by a 90-minute documentary [War Child\u2019, premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and won the prestigious Cadillac Award at the Tribeca Film Festival. His Autobiography is published by St. Martin's Press. Jal performed an electric set at the Mandela 90th Birthday in Hyde Park, London. He was presented to the stage by an enthusiastic Peter Gabriel, calling him a young Bob Marley in the making.\nSummer of 2008 included one of Sonic360\u2019s proudest releases - from legendary Steely Dan man Walter Becker. Over the past 38 years, Becker and his long-time collaborator Donald Fagen have released 10 albums under the Steely Dan moniker. 'Circus Money' was Becker\u2019s second highly anticipated solo effort, produced by Grammy\u00ae Award-winning producer Larry Klein.\n\n\n== Selected Discography ==\nP=Produced / E=Engineered / M=Mixed / R=Recorded\nAcida \u2013 La Vida Real (album, Sonic360)\nKinky \u2013 Atlas (album, Sonic360) \u2013 Exec.

            "content": "Blame is the act of censuring, holding responsible, making negative statements about an individual or group that their action or actions are socially or morally irresponsible, the opposite of praise. When someone is morally responsible for doing something wrong their action is blameworthy. By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for doing something right, we may say that his or her action is praiseworthy. There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone's good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.\n\n\n== Neurology ==\nBlaming appears to relate to include brain activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The amygdala has been found to contribute when we blame others, but not when we respond to their positive actions.\n\n\n== Sociology and psychology ==\nHumans - consciously and unconsciously - constantly make judgments about other people. The psychological criteria for judging others may be partly ingrained, negative and rigid indicating some degree of grandiosity.\nBlaming provides a way of devaluing others, with the end result that the blamer feels superior, seeing others as less worthwhile making the blamer \"perfect\". Off-loading blame means putting the other person down by emphasizing his or her flaws.\nVictims of manipulation and abuse frequently feel responsible for causing negative feelings in the manipulator/abuser towards them and the resultant anxiety in themselves. This self-blame often becomes a major feature of victim status.\nThe victim gets trapped into a self-image of victimization. The psychological profile of victimization includes a pervasive sense of helplessness, passivity, loss of control, pessimism, negative thinking, strong feelings of guilt, shame, remorse, self-blame and depression. This way of thinking can lead to hopelessness and despair.\n\n\n=== Self-blame ===\nTwo main types of self-blame exist:\nbehavioral self-blame \u2013 undeserved blame based on actions. Victims who experience behavioral self-blame feel that they should have done something differently, and therefore feel at fault.\ncharacterological self-blame \u2013 undeserved blame based on character. Victims who experience characterological self-blame feel there is something inherently wrong with them which has caused them to deserve to be victimized.\nBehavioral self-blame is associated with feelings of guilt within the victim. While the belief that one had control during the abuse (past control) is associated with greater psychological distress, the belief that one has more control during the recovery process (present control) is associated with less distress, less withdrawal, and more cognitive reprocessing.\nCounseling responses found helpful in reducing self-blame include:\nsupportive responses\npsychoeducational responses (learning about rape trauma syndrome for example)\nresponses addressing the issue of blame.\nA helpful type of therapy for self-blame is cognitive restructuring or cognitive\u2013behavioral therapy. Cognitive reprocessing is the process of taking the facts and forming a logical conclusion from them that is less influenced by shame or guilt.\n\n\n=== Victim blaming ===\n\nVictim blaming is holding the victims of a crime, an accident, or any type of abusive maltreatment to be entirely or partially responsible for the incident that has occurred.\n\n\n=== Blame shifting ===\n\nBlaming others can lead to a \"kick the dog\" effect where individuals in a hierarchy blame their immediate subordinate, and this propagates down a hierarchy until the lowest rung (the \"dog\"). A 2009 experimental study has shown that blaming can be contagious even for uninvolved onlookers.\n\n\n=== As a propaganda technique ===\nLabeling theory accounts for blame by postulating that when intentional actors act out to continuously blame an individual for nonexistent psychological traits and for nonexistent variables, those actors aim to induce irrational guilt at an unconscious level. Blame in this case becomes a propaganda tactic, using repetitive blaming behaviors, innuendos, and hyperbole in order to assign negative status to normative humans. When innocent people are blamed fraudulently for nonexistent psychological states and nonexistent behaviors, and there is no qualifying deviance for the blaming behaviors, the intention is to create a negative valuation of innocent humans to induce fear, by using fear mongering. For centuries, governments have used blaming in the form of demonization to influence public perceptions of various other governments, to induce feelings of nationalism in the public. Blame can objectify people, groups, and nations, typically negatively influencing the intended subjects of propaganda, compromising their objectivity. Blame is utilized as a social-control technique.\n\n\n=== In organizations ===\n\nSome systems theorists and management consultants, such as Gerald Weinberg, see the flow of blame in an organization as one of the most important indicators of that organization's robustness and integrity. Blame flowing upwards in a hierarchy, Weinberg argues, proves that superiors can take responsibility for their orders to their inferiors, and supply them with the resources required to do their jobs. But blame flowing downwards, from management to staff, or laterally between professionals, indicate organizational failure. In a blame culture, problem-solving is replaced by blame-avoidance. Weinberg emphasizes that blame coming from the top generates \"fear, malaise, errors, accidents, and passive-aggressive responses from the bottom\", with those at the bottom feeling powerless and lacking emotional safety.\nA no-blame culture has been widely considered as a means to increase safety, in particular in areas where the consideration of possible human error is important, for instance in hospitals and in aviation. Together with questions of accountability, this has also been subsumed under the concept of creating a Just culture. However, research conducted by King's College London found that increasing transparency and regulation in health care had unintended consequences of increasing defensive practice. Linked to rare but high-profile scandals, a self-interested blame business was found to be increasing a presumption of \"guilty until proven innocent\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDouglas, T.

            "content": "Maria Elena Vidal (born August 1, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter. She is known for her hit single \"Body Rock\", which reached #8 on the US Dance Charts, #48 on the Hot 100, #11 in the UK, and charted on all international charts. It was the theme song to the film Body Rock in 1984. The song is considered a dance classic.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early career (1977\u20131980) ===\nVidal was a founding member of the New York City-based band, Desmond Child & Rouge. They released two well-received albums in 1979 and 1980 for Capitol Records. They toured the country and were the musical guests on Saturday Night Live. Their iconic hit \"Our Love is Insane\" was their own particular blend of rock and disco. The band is known for their inclusion on the soundtrack to The Warriors in 1979, with the song \"Last of an Ancient Breed\".\nVidal, as a member of Rouge along with Diana Grasselli and Myriam Valle, was asked by Paul Schaffer (the band's keyboardist), to sing on a live comedy album that he was the musical director on for Gilda Radner. While making the album, Radner and producer Lorne Michaels, decided instead to turn it into a Broadway show: Gilda Radner \u2013 Live From New York opened at the Winter Garden Theater in the summer of 1979. Rouge performed as musicians as well as a variety of characters on stage. They toured Boston and Chicago, where the performances were made into the film Gilda Live directed by Mike Nichols.\n\n\n=== Solo career ===\nWhen the band parted ways, her first solo endeavor was an album with EMI, where she worked with producer John \"Jellybean\" Benitez. While working on the album, she was asked to sing the theme song of the film \"Body Rock,\" produced by Phil Ramone. It became an international hit. Vidal toured around the world promoting it.\nJimmy Iovine then signed Vidal as a solo artist to A&M Records after hearing her demo of \"Do Me Right\", which had been written and produced for her by Desmond. It became the first single off her eponymous debut solo album and was very popular internationally, especially in South America. The music video was directed by David Fincher.\nIn 1991, she sang a duet with Desmond Child on the Burt Bacharach/Desmond Child penned power ballad, \"Obsession.\" At the time, Vidal was making her third solo album with British-owned Charisma Records, but the album was never released.\nAs a singer, songwriter and producer, Vidal has contributed to many other artists' music.\nVidal contributed backup vocals to Kiss' Paul Stanley's solo album, Stevie Nicks' single \"I Can't Wait\" as well as a few other tracks from Nicks' solo album \"Rock A Little\", and was a featured vocalist for The Smithereens' single \"A Girl Like You\". She appears on many of Belinda Carlisle's solo albums, including the 1989 album \"Runaway Horses\". Other highlights include vocals for artists such as: Aerosmith, Seal, Alice Cooper, Celine Dion, Bette Midler, and Cher. Maria also appears on albums from Cat Stevens, and, most recently, Lana del Rey.\nAs a songwriter, Vidal wrote the hit single \u201cSummer Rain\u201d for Belinda Carlisle , which was covered in 2004 by Slinkee Minx, as well as the title song to Carlisle's album \u201cA Woman and a Man\u201d. Vidal has written songs with Desmond Child, Billy Steinberg, and Rick Nowels, including Ace of Base single \"Every Time it Rains\" and Belinda Carlisle's \"California.\"\nAs a studio vocal arranger and producer, Vidal has worked with a myriad of artists. Vidal's credits include Carrie Underwood and the other finalists on American Idol season 4.\nShe appeared in the 1985 horror comedy film Once Bitten as a member of a high school band, and contributed two songs to the soundtrack.\nIn May 2009 Maria Vidal announced the release of her album Living in Radical Radiance. The album can be downloaded on her website or ordered through the website shop.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\n1987: Maria Vidal\n2009: Living In Radical Radiance\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n1979: Our Love is Insane\n1984: Body Rock\n1985: Hands Off\n1986: Just One Kiss\n1987: Hands Off\n1987: Do Me Right\n1988: Make Believe\n1991: Obsession\n2008: Green (non-album track)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaria Vidal official website\nMaria Vidal at AllMusic\nLiving in Radical Radiance album",

            "content": "G.fast is a digital subscriber line (DSL) protocol standard for local loops shorter than 500 m, with performance targets between 150 Mbit/s and 1 Gbit/s, depending on loop length. High speeds are only achieved over very short loops. Although G.fast was initially designed for loops shorter than 250 meters, Sckipio in early 2015 demonstrated G.fast delivering speeds over 100 Mbit/s nearly 500 meters and the EU announced a research project.\nFormal specifications have been published as ITU-T G.9700 and G.9701, with approval of G.9700 granted in April 2014 and approval of G.9701 granted on December 5, 2014. Development was coordinated with the Broadband Forum's FTTdp (fiber to the distribution point) project. The name G.fast is an acronym for fast access to subscriber terminals; the letter G stands for the ITU-T G series of recommendations. Limited demonstration hardware was demonstrated in mid-2013. The first chipsets were introduced in October 2014, with commercial hardware introduced in 2015, and first deployments started in 2016.\n\n\n== Technology ==\n\n\n=== Modulation ===\n\nIn G.fast, data is modulated using discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation, as in VDSL2 and most ADSL variants. G.fast modulates up to 12 bit per DMT frequency carrier, reduced from 15 in VDSL2 for complexity reasons.\nThe first version of G.fast will specify 106 MHz profiles, with 212 MHz profiles planned for future amendments, compared to 8.5, 17.664, or 30 MHz profiles in VDSL2. This spectrum overlaps the FM broadcast band between 87.5 and 108 MHz, as well as various military and government radio services. To limit interference to those radio services, the ITU-T G.9700 recommendation, also called G.fast-psd, specifies a set of tools to shape the power spectral density of the transmit signal; G.9701, codenamed G.fast-phy, is the G.fast physical layer specification. To enable co-existence with ADSL2 and the various VDSL2 profiles, the start frequency can be set to 2.2, 8.5, 17.664, or 30 MHz, respectively.\n\n\n=== Duplex ===\nG.fast uses time-division duplexing (TDD), as opposed to ADSL2 and VDSL2, which use frequency-division duplexing. Support for symmetry ratios between 90/10 and 50/50 is mandatory, 50/50 to 10/90 is optional. The discontinuous nature of TDD can be exploited to support low-power states, in which the transmitter and receiver remain disabled for longer intervals than would be required for alternating upstream and downstream operation. This optional discontinuous operation allows a trade-off between throughput and power consumption.\n\n\n=== Channel coding ===\nThe forward error correction (FEC) scheme using trellis coding and Reed\u2013Solomon coding is similar to that of VDSL2. FEC does not provide good protection against impulse noise. To that end, the impulse noise protection (INP) data unit retransmission scheme specified for ADSL2, ADSL2+, and VDSL2 in G.998.4 is also present in G.fast. To respond to abrupt changes in channel or noise conditions, fast rate adaptation (FRA) enables rapid (<1 ms) reconfiguration of the data rate.\n\n\n=== Vectoring ===\nPerformance in G.fast systems is limited to a large extent by crosstalk between multiple wire pairs in a single cable. Self-FEXT (far-end crosstalk) cancellation, also called vectoring, is mandatory in G.fast. Vectoring technology for VDSL2 was previously specified by the ITU-T in G.993.5, also called G.vector. The first version of G.fast will support an improved version of the linear precoding scheme found in G.vector, with non-linear precoding planned for a future amendment. Testing by Huawei and Alcatel shows that non-linear precoding algorithms can provide an approximate data rate gain of 25% compared to linear precoding in very high frequencies; however, the increased complexity leads to implementation difficulties, higher power consumption, and greater costs. Since all current G.fast implementations are limited to 106 MHz, non-linear precoding yields little performance gain. Instead, current efforts to deliver a gigabit are focusing on bonding, power and more bits per hertz.\n\n\n== Performance ==\nIn tests performed in July 2013 by Alcatel-Lucent and Telekom Austria using prototype equipment, aggregate (sum of uplink and downlink) data rates of 1.1 Gbit/s were achieved at a distance of 70 m and 800 Mbit/s at a distance of 100 m, in laboratory conditions with a single line. On older, unshielded cable, aggregate data rates of 500 Mbit/s were achieved at 100 m.\nA A straight loop is a subscriber line (local loop) without bridge taps.\nB The listed values are aggregate (sum of uplink and download) data rates.\n\n\n== Deployment scenarios ==\nThe Broadband Forum is investigating architectural aspects of G.fast and has, as of May 2014, identified 23 use cases. Deployment scenarios involving G.fast bring fiber closer to the customer than traditional VDSL2 FTTN (fiber to the node), but not quite to the customer premises as in FTTH (fiber to the home). The term FTTdp (fiber to the distribution point) is commonly associated with G.fast, similar to how FTTN is associated with VDSL2. In FTTdp deployments, a limited number of subscribers at a distance of up to 200\u2013300 m are attached to one fiber node, which acts as DSL access multiplexer (DSLAM). As a comparison, in ADSL2 deployments the DSLAM may be located in a central office (CO) at a distance of up to 5 km from the subscriber, while in some VDSL2 deployments the DSLAM is located in a street cabinet and serves hundreds of subscribers at distances up to 1 km. VDSL2 is also widely used in fiber to the basement.\nA G.fast FTTdp fiber node has the approximate size of a large shoebox and can be mounted on a pole or underground. In a FTTB (fiber to the basement) deployment, the fiber node is in the basement of a multi-dwelling unit (MDU) and G.fast is used on the in-building telephone cabling. In a fiber to the front yard scenario, each fiber node serves a single home. The fiber node may be reverse-powered by the subscriber modem. For the backhaul of the FTTdp fiber node, the Broadband Forum's FTTdp architecture provides GPON, XG-PON1, EPON, 10G-EPON, point-to-point fiber Ethernet, and bonded VDSL2 as options.\nFormer FCC chief of staff Blair Levin has expressed skepticism that US ISPs have enough incentives to adopt G.fast technology.\n\n\n== XG-fast ==\nBell Labs, Alcatel-Lucent proposed the system concepts of XG-FAST, the 5th generation broadband (5GBB) technology capable of delivering a 10 Gbit/s data rate over short copper pairs. It is demonstrated that multi-gigabit rates are achievable over typical drop lengths of up to 130 m, with net data rates exceeding 10 Gbit/s on the shortest loops.\nThe XG-FAST technology will make fiber-to-the-frontage (FTTF) deployments feasible, which avoids many of the hurdles accompanying a traditional FTTH roll-out. Single subscriber XG-FAST devices would be an integral component of FTTH deployments, and as such help accelerate a worldwide roll-out of FTTH services. Moreover, an FTTF XG-FAST network is able to provide a remotely managed infrastructure and a cost-effective multi-gigabit backhaul for future 5G wireless networks.\n\n\n== G.fast internet service providers ==\nSwisscom\nOn 2016-10-18 Swisscom (Switzerland) Ltd launched G.fast in Switzerland after a more than four-year project phase. In a first step G.fast will be deployed in the FTTdp environment. Swisscom works together with its technology partner Huawei which is the supplier of the G.fast micro-nodes (DSLAMs) that are installed in the manholes.\nFrontier CommunicationsNokia and Frontier Communications are to deploy G.fast in a pilot program in Connecticut.\nM-net Telekommunikations GmbH\nThe Bavarian operator M-net Telekommunikations GmbH announced on 2017-05-30 that it is launching G.fast services in Munich. M-net claims to be the first carrier running G.fast in Germany.\nAT&T\nOn 2017-08-22 AT&T announced it is launching G.fast services in 22 US metro markets.\nBTBT launched their G.fast service for the UK on 16th January 2017.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nITU Standards Group SG15\nWhat is G.Fast and when will we see it in London?",

It is located in the highlands near the center of the Moon, in the center of the triangle formed by the much larger craters Albategnius, Ptolemaeus, and Hipparchus. About 90 km east lies Halley, while about 65 km northwest is Gyld\u00e9n.\nThe rim of this crater is irregular and slightly oblong, with the long dimension oriented along a north\u2013south axis. The southeastern rim is notched by two smaller craters identified as M\u00fcller A and M\u00fcller O.\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of this crater is the peculiar linear formation of small craters that starts at the southern edge of M\u00fcller's rim. These follow a line to the northwest, tangential to the rim of Ptolemaeus.\n\nAnother small crater not completely touching the crater rim but a smaller crater is M\u00fcller F and is located west-southwest. Northwest of that are a few craters that is unofficially a crater chain that extends to the vicinity of Ptolemaeus.\n\n\n== Satellite craters ==\nBy convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to M\u00fcller.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nM\u00fcller at The Moon Wiki",

            "content": "Fritted glass is finely porous glass through which gas or liquid may pass. It is made by sintering together glass particles into a solid but porous body. This porous glass body can be called a frit. Applications in laboratory glassware include use in fritted glass filter items, scrubbers, or spargers. Other laboratory applications of fritted glass include packing in chromatography columns and resin beds for special chemical synthesis.\nIn a fritted glass filter, a disc or pane of fritted glass is used to filter out solid particles, precipitate, or residue from a fluid, similar to a piece of filter paper. The fluid can go through the pores in the fritted glass, but the frit will often stop a solid from going through. A fritted filter is often part of a glassware item, so fritted glass funnels and fritted glass crucibles are available.\nLaboratory scale spargers (also known as gas diffusing stones or diffusors) as well as scrubbers, and gas-washing bottles (or Drechsel bottles) are similar glassware items which may use a fritted glass piece fused to the tip of a gas-inlet tube. This fritted glass tip is placed inside the vessel with liquid inside during use such that the fritted tip is submerged in the liquid. To maximize surface area contact of the gas to the liquid, a gas stream is slowly blown into the vessel through the fritted glass tip so that it breaks up the gas into many tiny bubbles. The purpose of sparging is to saturate the enclosed liquid with the gas, often to displace another gaseous component. The purpose of a scrubber or gas-washing bottle is to scrub the gas such that the liquid absorbs one (or more) of the gaseous components to remove it from the gas stream, effectively purifying the gas stream.\nBecause frits are made up of particles of glass that are bonded together by small contact areas, it is wise to avoid using them in strongly alkaline conditions, as these can dissolve the glass to some extent. This is not normally a problem, as the amount dissolved is usually minute, but the equally minute bonds in a frit can be rotted away, causing the frit to fall apart over time. As such, consideration should be given to using frits in such solutions and they should be rapidly and thoroughly rinsed when cleaning the glass with bases like potassium hydroxide (KOH).\n\n\n== Notes ==",

            "content": "York Racecourse is a horse racing venue in York, North Yorkshire, England. It is the third biggest racecourse in Britain in terms of total prize money offered, and second behind Ascot in prize money offered per meeting. It attracts around 350,000 racegoers per year and stages three of the UK's 31 Group One races \u2013 the Juddmonte International Stakes, the Nunthorpe Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe course is located in the south-west of the city, next to the former Terry's of York factory, The Chocolate Works. It is situated on an expanse of ground which has been known since pre-medieval times as the Knavesmire, from the Anglo-Saxon \"knave\" meaning a man of low standing, and \"mire\" meaning a swampy pasture for cattle. For this reason, the racecourse is still sometimes referred to as \"The Knavesmire\". The Knavesmire was originally common pasture, belonging to the city. It was also the scene of the hanging of Dick Turpin in 1739.\n\n\n== History ==\nRacing in York dates back to at least Roman times, with some archaeological evidence suggesting that there may have been equine activities that could have included forms of racing on the site of the Knavesmire as early as neolithic times. The city corporation is known to have given its support to the sport from 1530 and, in 1607, racing is known to have taken place on the frozen River Ouse, between Micklegate Tower and Skeldergate Postern. A famous yearly race for a golden bell was taking place in the nearby Forest of Galtres in 1590.\nThere is some uncertainty over when racing first arrived at the current site. The official stance of York Racecourse itself is that racing was first held on the Knavesmire when York's race meeting was moved in 1730 from a previous site at Clifton Ings which was prone to flooding. This is the line taken by the early racing historian, Pick, who maintained that the first race run over the Knavesmire course was the King's Guineas of 1731. There are multiple attestations to this previous racecourse at Clifton Ings, where racing can be traced back at least as far as 1709 and where, in 1714, \"such was the concourse of nobility and gentry that attended York races that one hundred and fifty coaches were at one time on the course\". The uncertainty lies in the period 1709\u20131731 and on this, early sources are confusing.\nOrton's Turf Annals of York and Doncaster, which records the results of races at this time, has them taking place at \"Clifton and Rawcliffe Ings\" in the period 1709 and 1731 which would support the official view. However, Sheahan and Whellan, 19th century York historians, have racing taking place in both places in 1709 \u2013 \"a regular race meeting on Clifton Ings\" and, in the same year, a collection taking place among the citizens to purchase five plates as prizes for a meeting on the Knavesmire. Drake's Eboracum, another early history, when talking of York's races says, \"Clifton-ings was for several years the place of trial; but upon a misunderstanding with the owner of that ground, or great part of it, the race was altered; and Knavesmire, a common pasture belonging to the city, was pitched upon for that purpose.\" Since, Drake was writing in 1736, it is deemed unlikely that he would write in such a manner if the move to Knavesmire had been so recent. There is also some slight confusion arising from the running of Royal Cups at nearby Black Hambleton.. A Royal Plate was raced for \"at York\" from 1711, but the Black Hambleton Cup was older still.\nThe Saunders & Co. History, using all these sources concludes \"the races were held annually on both courses \u2013 at Clifton Ings previous to and for some years subsequent to the year 1709, and at Knavesmire at and from that date; and that most probably in or about the year 1731, the races were done away with at the former place and transferred to the latter.\"\nWhat is clear, whenever races were first run on the Knavesmire, is that York was the first centre after Newmarket to formulate a structured race programme, starting in 1751 with the Great Subscription Purses.\nThe Knavesmire course, as the name suggests, was often very swampy, and in 1776, heavy rains meant that horses had to race for about fifty yards up to their knees in water.\nBy the 19th century there were two main meetings at York \u2013 the Spring Meeting in May and another in August. These were supplemented by the Yorkshire Union Hunt Meeting in October, and a steeplechase meeting in April.\nAt the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, the local military commander General Sir John Byng was absent because he had two horses running at York that day, and delegated command to his deputy, who failed to control the dangerously large crowd.\nOn 31 May 1982, Pope John Paul II visited York racecourse and drew a reported audience of 190,000. \nOn 22 September 1984, the racecourse hosted its first music concert headlined by Echo & the Bunnymen. In recent years, concerts have been arranged after race meetings in June and July and since2015 it has hosted the Yorfest. \nThe second day of the 2014 Tour de France started from the racecourse.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nIn 1754, at the instigation of the Marquess of Rockingham the first grandstand was built at a cost of \u00a31,250 by the architect John Carr. New stands were erected in 1890, incorporating much of the original building. The late 20th century saw progressive development of the facilities. A new five-tier grandstand was opened in 1965, the Melrose Stand was opened in 1989 and this was quickly followed by the award-winning Knavesmire Stand, with additional conference facilities in 1996. 2003 saw the opening of the Ebor Stand. The course now has a spectator capacity of 60,000.\n\n\n== Layout ==\nIn the 18th century the racecourse was horseshoe in shape and was \"judged to be the best race[course] in England for seeing the diversion.\" In 2005 the track was extended from the end of the home straight to make a full round course, this was to host the 2 m 4 f Gold Cup for the Royal meeting which was moved from Ascot to York that year. This meant 2 mile races were run on the round course, starting just before the winning post. The old 2 mile start was discontinued. The previous layout occurred in the early 1970s, when to accommodate the York ring road (A64), opened in 1976, the straight course was reduced from 7 furlongs to 6 furlongs and the new 7 furlong chute was built.\n\n\n== Important meetings ==\nYork's most important meeting is the Ebor Festival held annually in August. The feature of this meeting is the Ebor Handicap, one of Europe's premier handicap races.\nThe Juddmonte International meeting is another significant date in York's racing calendar, home as it is to the Juddmonte International Stakes. The 2012 renewal of this race, won by Frankel was the second highest rated race of the year in international ratings.\nIn 2005, York Racecourse acted as a replacement host to the Royal Ascot meeting, due to its usual home at Ascot Racecourse being closed for a \u00a3185 million redevelopment, attracting a 5-day attendance of over 224,000. It also hosted the St Leger in 2006.\nYork also has its own radio station 'York Raceday Radio' (1602 kHz, medium wave) which can be received up to 10 miles from the course.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe track won the Racecourse of the Year title in 1997, 2003 and 2017, and came out on top in The Times newspaper survey of all Britain's racecourses.\n\n\n== Records ==\nAttendances\nAll-time \u2013 c. 150,000 (1851) for the Great Match between Voltigeur and The Flying Dutchman\nModern day \u2013 50,510 (Thursday 16 June 2005)\n\n\n== Notable races ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCamden, William (1722).

Its main office is in Tbilisi.\n\n\n== History ==\nAfter gaining independence on May 26, 1918 on the National Council meeting the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia was formed. Its main tasks included fighting counter-revolutionary rallies and Bolshevik propaganda, combating embezzlement of public funds, etc. On February 25, 1921, with the help of Russia, the Georgian Bolsheviks overthrew the legitimate Menshevik government of Georgia. Since this day, the independent Ministry of Internal Affairs was disbanded. By the Decision of Georgian Revolutionary Committee of March 6, 1921, the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs of Georgia was established. On August 8, 1941, by the Decree of the Presidium of Supreme Council of Georgian SSR, the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs and the People's Commissariat of State Security have merged into People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs. On April 15, 1953, the Supreme Council of Georgian SSR adopted a law on Transformation of state ministries of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia. According to the new law, the State Security Ministry merged into the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgian SSR. On April 10, 1954, by the Decree of the Presidium of Supreme Council of Georgian SSR, the State Security Committee (KGB) under the Council of Ministers of the Georgian SSR was founded. On September 18, 1962, under the Decree of the Supreme Council of Georgian SSR, the Ministry of Internal affairs of Georgian SSR has become the republican Ministry of Public Safety. On November 19, 1968, it recovered its old name \u2013 the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Since the introduction of extensive reforms of Georgian law enforcement in 2003, the Ministry of State Security merged into the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Based on the reforms implemented during 2015, organizational and institutional separation of police and state security services was carried out. An Independent State Security Service was formed.\n\n\n== Special divisions and agencies ==\nThe MIA deploys numerous designated sub branches for extraordinary crisis and emergency situations. Those include special measures and rapid deployment capabilities for particular events such as unrests or biological and chemical warfare utilized against the civilian population by hostile entities. Employed especially for latter events is the Emergency Management Agency which is responsible for dealing with any kind of man-made or natural disasters. The Special Tasks Department was established for rapid response to maintain public order and security as a supportive operational force to all other divisions. Its units are among various other obligations, also tasked with protecting the vital Baku\u2013Supsa Pipeline. The STD is also capable of performing combat operations in a supportive role for the armed forces of Georgia and did so during the 2008 war. The overall security of pipelines, however, falls under the general responsibility of the Strategic Pipelines Protection Department (SPPD).

            "content": "The BMW Guggenheim Lab is a collaboration between the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and the BMW Group. It is an interdisciplinary mobile laboratory that visited three cities around the world between 2011 and 2013. The lab is part urban think tank, part community center, and part gathering space, and explores issues of urban life through public programming and discourse. Three different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which would travel to three cities. The lab has an advisory committee of experts and is operated by a lab team.\nThe Lab was expected to travel to nine cities over the course of six years. In 2013, however, BMW ended its support of the project, and the project ended in 2014, with an exhibition in New York.\n\n\n== Concept, organization and structures ==\nThe concept behind the lab was developed by David van der Leer, assistant curator, architecture and urban studies, and Maria Nicanor, assistant curator, architecture, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. The lab's advisory committee is composed of internationally renowned experts in a range of fields and nominates members for each city's lab team, an interdisciplinary group that will help create the programming for that location.\nThree different structures were to house the lab over the life of the project, each of which could be moved and would travel to three cities. Only one structure was built. It was designed by the Tokyo-based architecture firm Atelier Bow-Wow. Seoul-based graphic designers Sulki & Min created the graphic identity for the project, including an interactive logo that changed over the course of the project.\nThe lab's three-city cycle was designed around the theme Confronting Comfort, which explores ways of making urban environments more responsive to people's needs, striking a balance between individual and collective comfort, and promoting environmental and social responsibility. The program was designed to proactively engage residents from each city, and participants on the Internet and from around the world, in free programs and experiments, and it addressed ideas and issues of particular relevance to each city. The Advisory Committee members are: Daniel Barenboim, Elizabeth Diller, Nicholas Humphrey, Muchadeyi Masunda, Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, Juliet Schor, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and Wang Shi.\n\n\n== New York City ==\nThe lab was open from August 3 to October 16, 2011, in New York City's East Village and was attended by over 54,000 visitors from 60 countries. Members of the New York Lab Team were Omar Freilla, founder and coordinator of Green Worker Cooperatives, Bronx, New York; Charles Montgomery, Canadian journalist and urban experimentalist; Olatunbosun Obayomi, Nigerian microbiologist and inventor; and architects and urbanists Elma van Boxel and Kristian Koreman, founders of Zones Urbaines Sensible, Rotterdam. The first Public Programs Manager in New York City was Rosanna Flouty.\n\n\n== Berlin ==\nFrom June 15 to July 29, 2012, the lab was open in Pfefferberg, a complex of galleries and artist studios in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin. Members of the Berlin Lab were Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez-M\u00e1rquez, program director for the Innovations in International Health Initiative (IIH) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Italian architect and engineer Carlo Ratti, who directs the MIT Senseable City Lab; Berlin-based artist Corinne Rose, who works with photography and video and teaches at the Bern University of the Arts, Switzerland; and Rachel Smith, principal transport planner with AECOM, based in Brisbane. The programming of the Berlin Lab focused on four main topics: Empowerment Technologies (G\u00f3mez-M\u00e1rquez), Dynamic Connections (Smith), Urban Micro-Lens (Rose) and the Senseable (SENSEable) City (Ratti).\n\n\n== Mumbai ==\nThe lab opened in Mumbai, India on December 9, 2012 and ran until January 20, 2013. The central location was on the grounds of the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum in Mumbai\u2019s Byculla neighborhood, with additional satellite locations around the city. The lab's team consisted of Aisha Dasgupta, a British demographer based in Malawi; Neville Mars, a Dutch architect based in China; Trupti Amritwar Vaitla, an architect and urban transport designer from Mumbai; and H\u00e9ctor Zamora, a Mexican artist based in Brazil. Along with neighborhood-specific public programming, the Mumbai Lab program included participatory research studies and design projects, including a competition to redesign Mumbai's Kala Nagar Junction.\n\n\n== Final exhibition ==\nThe program concluded with an exhibition, Participatory City: 100 Urban Trends from the BMW Guggenheim Lab, which was on view at the New York museum from October 2013 through January 5, 2014. The exhibition featured photos and videos from the Lab's public programs and displayed 100 terms representing the \"most-talked about words\" during the Lab's activities in New York, Berlin, and Mumbai.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInformation from the Solomon R.

Yellow and red flowers are produced throughout the year in the species native range. It occurs in woodland, shrubland and heath in the coastal region between Cape Naturaliste and Cape Arid.\nThe species has a reputation as a reliable shrub in cultivation where it has usually been known by the names of Dillwynia obovata or Eutaxia obovata. It is well suited to being grown in rockeries, containers, or other situations providing good drainage. It is resistant to mild frosts and can be grown in coastal areas, with some protection. Pruning after flowering promotes more compact growth. Cultivated plants usually range between 0.75 and 1 metre high, and slightly less in width. Plants may be propagated from cuttings or scarified seed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nPink, A. (2004). Gardening for the Million. Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.",

In 1967, all of her income came from work on the Navajo Reservation; $16.20 was withheld from her wages. She requested a refund of the entire amount and protested the collection of state taxes. When the state declined her claim, she filed an action in the Arizona Superior Court. The court dismissed her case for failure to state a claim. McClanahan appealed to the Arizona Court of Appeals, which affirmed. The Arizona Supreme Court declined to hear the case, and the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari to hear the case.\n\n\n== Decision ==\nJustice Thurgood Marshall delivered the opinion of a unanimous court. Marshall found that there was nothing in federal law that authorized Arizona to collect a state income tax from an Indian that earned the income on the reservation. The case was reversed.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMcClanahan v. Arizonza State Tax Comm'n, 411 U.S. 164 (1973)",

            "content": "Ibrahim El-Salahi (born 5 September 1930) is a Sudanese artist painter and former politician and diplomat.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nEl-Salahi was born on 5 September 1930, in Omdurman, Sudan to a Muslim family and is arguably one of the most important modern African artists. His father's career was running a Qur'anic school, which transpires to be the place where El-Salahi learned and practiced his calligraphy, which is predominant throughout his artwork. As a result of his lack of interest and his marks in school prevented him from pursuing medicine, which fortunately led to him beginning his art career. He studied Art at the School of Design of the Gordon Memorial College, currently the University of Khartoum. On the basis of a scholarship, he subsequently went to the Slade School of Fine Art in London from 1954 to 1957. At the Slade School of Fine Art, El-Salahi was exposed to European schooling, modern circles, and various historical artist that unintentionally alters the constructions of his artworks. Studying here also allowed him to take formal and ideological cues from modernist painting, which helped him learned to balance pure expression and gestural freedom. Additionally, in 1962 he received a UNESCO scholarship to study in the United States, from where he visited South America. From 1964 to 1965 he returned to the US with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, and in 1966 he led the Sudanese delegation during the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar, Senegal.\nDue to the completion of his education training, he returned to Sudan. During the duration of his stay, he channeled calligraphy and elements of the Islamic culture that played a role in his everyday life. Trying to connect to his heritage, El-Salahi began to fill with symbols and marking of small Arabic inscriptions. As he became more advanced with incorporating Arabic calligraphy, the symbols began to produce animals, humans, and plant forms, providing more meaning to his artwork allowing viewers to connect to his work. El-Salahi learned to combine the European styles with the traditional Sudanese themes in his art, which evokes a transnational African-influenced surrealism.\nEl-Salahi was assistant cultural attach\u00e9 at the Sudanese Embassy in London from 1969 to 1972, when he returned to Sudan as Director of Culture under Jaafar Nimeiri's regime, then Undersecretary in the Ministry of Culture and Information until September 1975, when he was imprisoned without charge for six months for being accused of participating in an anti-government coup.\nWhile imprison El-Salahi would use his 25 exercise minutes he received everyday to sketch out ideas for huge painting. He would secretly sketch and bury the small drawing into the ground to maintain his ideas. Ten years after being released from prison he self-exiled himself from the country and for some years worked and lived in Doha, Qatar, before settling in Oxford, England.\n\n\n== Art ==\nHe is considered a pioneer in Sudanese art and was a member of the \"Khartoum School\" that was founded by Osman Waqialla. In the 1960s he was associated with the Mbari Club in Ibadan, Nigeria.\nHe developed an own style and was one of the first artists to elaborate the Arabic calligraphy in his paintings. His work has developed through several phases. His first period during the 1950s, '60s and '70s is dominated by elementary forms and lines. Then his work becomes rather meditative, abstract and organic. Subsequently, his work is characterized by lines, while he mainly uses white and black paint.\nIn 2001, Ibrahim el-Salahi was honored with a Prince Claus Award from the Netherlands.\nIn the summer of 2013 a major retrospective show of El-Salahi's work was mounted at Tate Modern, London, running from 3 July to 22 September 2013, The Tate's first retrospective dedicated to an African artist.\n\n\n== Solo exhibitions ==\n2016: The Armory, New York (Vigo Gallery)\n2016: Salon 94, New York\n2015: Vigo Gallery, London\n2015: Frieze New York (Vigo Gallery)\n2015: Jerwood Gallery, Hastings\n2014: Vigo Gallery, London\n2014: Skoto Gallery, New York\n2013: Tate Modern, London\n2012: Katara Cultural Village Foundation, Doha\n2012: Sharjah Art Museum\n2011: Skoto Gallery, New York\n2010: Rashid Diab Arts Centre, Khartoum\n2000: Dara Art Gallery, Khartoum\n1992: Savannah Gallery, London\n1984 & 1990: Iwalewa Haus, Contemporary African Art Centre, Bayreuth\n1974: Art Gallery of the National Council for Arts and Letters, Kuwait\n1972: Agisymba Gallery, Berlin\n1967 & 1969: French Cultural Centre, Khartoum\n1967: Traverse Gallery, Edinburgh\n1967: Galerie Lambert, Paris\n1966: Carl Durisberg, Munich\n1964: Daberkow Gallery, Frankfurt\n1964: Irvington-on-Hudson, New York\n1963: Murphy Gallery, Baltimore\n1963: Middle East House, Washington DC\n1963: ICA Gallery, London\n1962: Galerie Lambert, Paris\n1962: American Cultural Centre, Khartoum\n1961: Mbari Gallery, Ibadan\n1960: Grand Hotel Exhibition Hall, Khartoum\n\n\n== Group shows ==\n2011\u201312: Meem Gallery, Dubai\n2010: Interventions & Sajjil, Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art, Doha\n2010: Tradition of the Future, Future of Tradition', Haus der Kunst, Munich\n2010: Selections 2010, Skoto Gallery, New York\n2010: Doha Capital of Arab Culture, Qatar\n2004: The Oxford Show, Modern Art Oxford, Oxford\n2004: Sudan Past and Present, The British Museum, London\n2003: Asylum Years, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford\n2001\u201302: The Short Century, Museum Villa Stuck, Munich;

            "content": "Visual calculus, invented by Mamikon Mnatsakanian (known as Mamikon), is an approach to solving a variety of integral calculus problems. Many problems that would otherwise seem quite difficult yield to the method with hardly a line of calculation, often reminiscent of what Martin Gardner calls \"aha! solutions\" or Roger Nelsen a proof without words.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nMamikon devised his method in 1959 while an undergraduate, first applying it to a well-known geometry problem: Find the area of a ring (annulus), given the length of a chord tangent to the inner circumference. (Perhaps surprisingly, no additional information is needed; the solution does not depend on the ring's inner and outer dimensions.)\nThe traditional approach involves algebra and application of the Pythagorean theorem. Mamikon's method, however, envisions an alternate construction of the ring: First the inner circle alone is drawn, then a constant-length tangent is made to travel along its circumference, \"sweeping out\" the ring as it goes.\nNow if all the (constant-length) tangents used in constructing the ring are translated so that their points of tangency coincide, the result is a circular disk of known radius (and easily computed area). Indeed, since the inner circle's radius is irrelevant, one could just as well have started with a circle of radius zero (a point)\u2014and sweeping out a ring around a circle of zero radius is indistinguishable from simply rotating a line segment about one of its endpoints and sweeping out a disk.\nMamikon's insight was to recognize the equivalence of the two constructions; and because they are equivalent, they yield equal areas. Moreover, so long as it is given that the tangent length is constant, the two starting curves need not be circular\u2014a finding not easily proven by more traditional geometric methods. This yields Mamikon's theorem:\nThe area of a tangent sweep is equal to the area of its tangent cluster, regardless of the shape of the original curve.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nTom Apostol has produced a very readable introduction to the subject. In it he shows that the problems of finding the area of a cycloid and tractrix can be solved by very young students. \"Moreover, the new method also solves some problems unsolvable by calculus, and allows many incredible generalizations yet unknown in mathematics.\" He also mentions that combining Mamikon's method with the geometric solution yields a new proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. Solutions to many other problems appear on Mamikon's Visual Calculus site.\n\n\n=== Area of a cycloid ===\n\nThe area of a cycloid can be calculated by considering the area between it and an enclosing rectangle. These tangents can all be clustered to form a circle. If the circle generating the cycloid has radius r then this circle also has radius r and area \u03c0r2. The area of the rectangle is \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        r\n        \u00d7\n        2\n        \u03c0\n        r\n        =\n        4\n        \u03c0\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2r\\times 2\\pi r=4\\pi r^{2}}\n  . Therefore the area of the cycloid is \n  \n    \n      \n        3\n        \u03c0\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 3\\pi r^{2}}\n  : it is 3 times the area of the generating circle.\nThe tangent cluster can be seen to be a circle because the cycloid is generated by a circle and the tangent to the cycloid will be at right angle to the line from the generating point to the rolling point. Thus the tangent and the line to the contact point form a right-angled triangle in the generating circle. This means that clustered together the tangents will describe the shape of the generating circle.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCavalieri's principle\nHodograph \u2013 This is a related construct that maps the velocity of a point using a polar diagram.\nThe Method of Mechanical Theorems\nPappus's centroid theorem\nPlanimeter\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMamikon \u2013 Main web site\nProjMath Mamikon\nProof without Words from MathWorld",

            "content": "USS Marias (AO-57) was a Cimarron-class fleet oiler acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. She served her country primarily in the Pacific Ocean Theatre of Operations, and provided petroleum products where needed to combat ships. For performing this dangerous task, she was awarded eight battle stars during World War II, and one campaign star during the Vietnam War for her bravery in combat areas.\nMarias, built under Maritime Commission contract by Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard, Inc., Sparrows Point, Maryland, was launched 21 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Henry Williams; and acquired and commissioned 12 February 1944, Comdr. Jens G. Olsen in command.\n\n\n== World War II Pacific Theatre operations ==\nMarias completed her shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay 8 March and ten days later was underway to Aruba, Netherlands West Indies. She loaded fuel oil and proceeded on to the Pacific. By 18 April she was anchored in Majuro Atoll, where she remained for six weeks, fueling the ships participating in strikes against the Marianas and the Carolines.\n\n\n== Supporting the Saipan invasion ==\nOn 3 June, the tanker sailed to Eniwetok to refuel fighting ships. Returning to Majuro on the 12th, she loaded for the upcoming Saipan assault, On the fueling station by the 21st, she remained through 3 July, servicing the ships covering the Saipan operation, including those returning from victory in the carrier Battle of the Philippine Sea.\n\n\n== Supporting Guam and Tinian invasions ==\nAfter replenishing at Eniwetok, she sailed back to the Marianas to support the invasions of Guam and Tinian. On 20 August she proceeded from Eniwetok in convoy to Manus, to refuel ships moving against the Japanese in the Philippines, Volcano, Bonin, and Palau Islands. In mid October, she began to operate in support of the U.S. 3rd Fleet, providing the fuel for their strikes on the Visayan Islands and the ensuing Battle for Leyte Gulf.\n\n\n== Supporting the invasion of the Philippines ==\nAt the end of October, Marias commenced operations at her new base, Ulithi. Two weeks later, as the campaign in the Philippines moved north, Marias loaded her tanks and sailed for those islands to fuel the ships conducting strikes on Luzon. During the next 2\u00bd months she remained in Philippine waters refueling, returning periodically to Ulithi for replenishment.\n\n\n== Supporting Iwo Jima operations ==\nMarias next fueled the ships of the U.S. 5th Fleet as they bombarded Iwo Jima and conducted raids on the Japanese homeland. On 24 February 1945, five days after the landings at Iwo Jima, the tanker returned to Ulithi to prepare for the Okinawa campaign. She arrived at the fueling area off Okinawa 16 March for the pre-invasion air and sea bombardment. For the next three months she serviced the ships engaged in the bitterly fought operation making fast run to Ulithi for replenishment.\nOn 3 July the veteran tanker departed Ulithi for her last wartime operation. Nine days later she took up station in the fueling area east of Honsh\u016b fueling the fleet as it struck at the enemy's home islands delivering the final blows of the war.\n\n\n== End-of-war activity ==\nFollowing the signing of the surrender terms, Marias entered Tokyo Bay, remaining there, with the exception of a voyage to Ulithi for fuel, until departing for the United States 27 October 1945.\n\n\n== Return to Stateside for upkeep ==\nMarias arrived San Pedro, California, 10 November, underwent yard overhaul and departed again for the western Pacific 5 February 1946. There she supported American occupational forces in the Far East until June 1947. During this period she served as a station tanker for two month periods at Taku, Hong Kong, and Shanghai and, operating out of Yokosuka, Japan, made five runs to the Persian Gulf in addition to regular fueling assignments.\nOn 1 June, Marias sailed for San Pedro, California, for another overhaul, followed by two round the world cruises, completing the second in April 1948. For the next four years, with one interruption - a cruise to Bahrein, 27 July to 9 October 1950 - the ship delivered fuel from the U.S. West Coast to Pearl Harbor and Alaskan ports.\n\n\n== Middle East operations ==\n\nOn 19 November 1952, Marias departed San Francisco, California, for her first deployment with the U.S. 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. The following years brought further six month deployments as a \"white oiler\", a supplier of aircraft fuel to the oilers that serviced the fleet. On 9 May 1955, she was assigned indefinitely to the Mediterranean, home ported at Barcelona, Spain, and for the ensuing years operated as part of Service Force, 6th Fleet.\nReassigned to the East Coast in July 1960, Marias was home ported at Norfolk, Virginia, and attached to the U.S. 2nd Fleet as a fleet oiler. She operated primarily with ASW forces in the western Atlantic into 1969 and was periodically deployed to serve the 6th fleet (1962, 1964, 1965, and 1968).\n\n\n== Cuban Crisis operations ==\nHer 1962 deployment was followed by a Caribbean cruise to support the ships enforcing the quarantine policy during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October to November of that year. Other activities during this period included participation in exercises such as \"Sea Orbit 1964\"; Operation Steel Pike, the largest peacetime amphibious landing in history (fall 1964); and Operation Springboard (1965 and 1967). These exercises ensured her capability to perform her vital services whenever and wherever called for.\n\n\n== Operating for MSC ==\n\nShe was decommissioned from the Navy and placed in service with the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as USNS Marias (T-AO-57) in 1973. As of the mid-1970s, she served as a fleet oiler in the Red Sea, and in 1976 Marias was refueling ships in the Mediterranean. Her home port during these operations was Mayport, Florida. In the summer of 1976 Marias returned to the U.S. and underwent a thorough hull cleaning and refurbishing in Baltimore, Maryland. After completion of that yard period, she spent the next several months in the North Atlantic, taking part in a large multi-national fleet exercise, refueling ships of various NATO countries during the course of the exercise. During that period of time, Marias was replenished several times, and took part in an experimental replenishment from a commercial tanker. Marias returned to her home port, for the first time in many years, in December 1976.\n\n\n== Fate ==\nMarias was transferred on 22 November 1982 to the James River Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 December 1992 and sold to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service on 18 September 1995 for scrapping.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nMarias received eight battle stars for World War II service.\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

            "content": "North Limited was a diversified mining and resources company. Although based in Australia, its operations eventually extended to six continents. By the late 20th century the company had become the fourth largest iron ore exporter in the world with expansion underway which would have made it equal third. It's biggest asset was a majority stake in Robe River, a major miner of the Pilbara iron ore deposits of Western Australia and the worlds lowest cost producer of iron ore.\nThe company was formed in 1888 as North Broken Hill Silver Mining to exploit the rich silver, lead and zinc deposits at Broken Hill in western New South Wales, the name was shortened to North Broken Hill in 1905. Production at the original North Broken Hill mine wound down and it finally closed in 1993.\nHowever over the years the company had diversified into other mining provinces. In 1988 they took over Peko Wallsend Limited, changing their name to the unwieldy North Broken Hill Peko Limited, before settling on the snappier North Limited in 1994. At Broken Hill the company had been known as 'North' to distinguish it from other miners in the area such as Broken Hill South and The Broken Hill Proprietary. The nickname continued long after the company's focus had moved away from Broken Hill, so the new name just formalized what it had always been known as.\nBy 2000, while North was a widely diversified resource company, iron ore assets represented 44% of its value and investing to begin production at the new West Angelas iron ore mine in the Pilbara was the company's major focus. However money had also been committed to increase production at the Iron Ore Company of Canada and the Northparkes copper and gold mine..\n\n\n== Takeover ==\nLike its peer Western Mining, North developed into a large diversified resources company with one special world class asset that attracted attention from huge mining companies across the world. In the case of Western Mining it was the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium deposit, for North it was Robe River Iron.\nIn 2000 a bidding war for North broke out when Rio Tinto launched a hostile takeover at $3.80 a share. This was topped by an Anglo American bid of $4.20, Rio Tinto responded with a successful offer of $4.75 per share. The company was delisted and after the takeover, Rio Tinto integrated most of North's assets into its own operations, but sold others such as the Northparkes.\n\n\n== Assets ==\nIn 2000 when it was taken over, North's major assets were:\nRobe River Iron Associates. A large, low cost iron ore miner in the Pilbara, Western Australia, 53% interest\nIron Ore Company of Canada, an iron ore miner in Labrador, 56.1% interest\nZinkgruvan, a zinc miner in Sweden, 100% ownership\nEnergy Resources of Australia, a uranium producer in the Northern Territory, 68.4% interest\nNorthparkes copper and gold mine in New South Wales, 80% interest\nAlumbrera a large copper and gold producer in Argentina, 25% interest\nNorth Forest Products. Producer of woodchips with a 43% share of the Australian export market\nGolden Valley Joint Venture, Kanowna Belle Gold Mine, 50% interest\nPeak Hill Joint Venture gold mine, 33.33% interest\nThe company was also exploring resource deposits in Australia, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Peru, Mexico and the United States\nPreviously North had owned many mines and companies. Some of them were:\nNorth Broken Hill silver lead and zinc mine\nWarman slurry pumps\nFormer Peko zinc assets, mostly those acquired from Electrolytic Zinc, Tasmania that were merged with Rio Tinto assets and spun off to form Pasminco in 1988\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The 2008 Egyptian general strike was a strike which occurred on 6 April 2008, by Egyptian workers, primarily in the state-run textile industry, in response to low wages and rising food costs. Strikes are illegal in Egypt and authorities have been given orders to break demonstrations forcefully in the past. The strike took place just two days before key municipal elections.\n\n\n== Lead-up ==\nUsing Facebook, blogs, SMS, independent media and word-of-mouth, activists, and workers in Egypt sought to organize strikes, protests, and demonstrations throughout the country on April 6. Calling it the \"Egyptian Intifida\", supporters called for civil disobedience, asking everyone to stay home from work and avoid making purchases. The strike began as an initiative of the workers of El-Mahalla El-Kubra but was picked up, promoted, and expanded by activists using the Internet and cell phones. April 6 Youth Movement, a group on the social networking site Facebook, attracted more than 64,000 members. Although the banned Islamist organization the Muslim Brotherhood did not officially support the strike, it did not prevent its members from participating, and several Muslim Brotherhood activists and bloggers supported the strike. The night before Egyptian blogger Malek and three activists from the Islamic Labour Party were arrested for posting fliers about the strike.\nThe text of the call for strike read:\n\nAll national forces in Egypt have agreed upon the 6th of April to be a public strike. On the 6th of April, stay home, do not go out; Don\u2019t go to work, don\u2019t go to the university, don\u2019t go to school, don\u2019t open your shop, don\u2019t open your pharmacy, don\u2019t go to the police station, don\u2019t go to the camp; We need salaries allowing us to live, we need to work, we want our children to get education, we need human transportation means, we want hospitals to get treatment, we want medicines for our children, we need just judiciary, we want security, we want freedom and dignity, we want apartments for youth; We don\u2019t want price increases, we don\u2019t want favouritism, we don\u2019t want police in plain clothes, we don\u2019t want torture in police stations, we don\u2019t want corruption, we don\u2019t want bribes, we don\u2019t want detentions. Tell your friends not to go to work and ask them to join the strike.\n\n\n== April 6: day of the strike ==\n\nThe strike at Mahalla was to have begun at 7 a.m. but plainclothes security personnel and police infiltrated the factory and allegedly intimidated workers from striking. Hundreds of plainclothes security men took control of the Mahalla textile factories before work began, seizing workers and forcing them to work. At the end of the day, police escorts led small groups of workers out of the factories in an attempt to discourage mass protests. This led some in the press to call the strike a failure and many left the region (about an hour outside Cairo) before any violence started. Two people, including a 15-year-old-boy, were killed by Egyptian police, who used tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition against the striking workers and other protesters. Several leaders of opposition parties have been detained, including the Kifaya coordinator Mohamed el-Ashqar, Freedom Commission Rapporteur of the Labor Party Mohamed Abdel Kodous, prominent activist and Kifaya member Magdy Qarqar, and blogger Sharkawy (who was sodomized and tortured by Egyptian police in 2006), and others.\nOfficial media channels controlled by the Egyptian government discouraged citizens from participating in the strike, and law enforcement officials warned that protesters could be punished with three months to one year in jail. Thousands of police lined the streets in downtown Cairo near the universities and in Mahalla in attempt to intimidate people and prevent them from participating. There were no protests in Cairo's Tahrir Square (most likely due to strong police presence; at least some protesters were chased from the square by police), though students at Ain Shams, Helwan and Cairo universities held demonstrations. Many people did stay home in solidarity with the protesters and out of fear of possible violence, with the streets of Cairo noticeably quiet and more stores than usual shuttered for the day.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The seventh season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones premiered on HBO on July 16, 2017, and concluded on August 27, 2017. Unlike previous seasons that consisted of ten episodes each, the seventh season consisted of only seven. Like the previous season, it largely consisted of original content not found in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, while also incorporating material Martin revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series. The series was adapted for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.\nThe penultimate season focuses primarily on the convergence of the show's main plotlines, featuring major events such as Daenerys Targaryen arriving in Westeros with her army and three dragons and waging war against the Lannisters, Jon Snow forging an alliance with Daenerys in an attempt to unite their forces against the White Walker army, Arya and Bran returning to Winterfell and reuniting with their sister Sansa, and the army of the dead breaching the Wall (with the help of a reanimated wight dragon) and entering the Seven Kingdoms.\nHBO ordered the seventh season on April 21, 2016, three days before the premiere of the show's sixth season, and began filming on August 31, 2016. The season was filmed primarily in Northern Ireland, Spain, Croatia and Iceland.\nGame of Thrones features a large ensemble cast, including Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, and Kit Harington. The season introduces several new cast members, including Jim Broadbent and Tom Hopper.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Main cast ===\n\n\n=== Guest cast ===\nThe recurring actors listed here are those who appeared in season 7. They are listed by the region in which they first appear.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Crew ===\nSeries creators and executive producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss serve as showrunners for the seventh season. The directors for the seventh season are Jeremy Podeswa (episodes 1 and 7), Mark Mylod (episodes 2 and 3), Matt Shakman (episodes 4 and 5) and Alan Taylor (episode 6). This marks Taylor's return to the series after an absence since the second season. Shakman is a first-time Game of Thrones director, with the rest each having directed multiple episodes in previous seasons. Michele Clapton returned to the show as costume designer, after spending some time away from the show in the sixth season. She previously worked on the show for the first five seasons, as well as the end of the sixth season.\n\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe seventh season contains original material not found in the A Song of Ice and Fire series. Some of the show's sixth season also consists of material revealed to the writers of the television series during discussions with Martin.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\n\nFilming began on August 31, 2016, at Titanic Studios in Belfast, and ended in February 2017. In an interview with the showrunners, it was announced that the filming of the seventh season would be delayed until later in the year due to necessary weather conditions for filming. The showrunners stated \"We're starting a bit later because, you know, at the end of this season, winter is here, and that means that sunny weather doesn't really serve our purposes any more. We kind of pushed everything down the line so we could get some grim, gray weather even in the sunnier places that we shoot.\"\nGirona, Spain did not return as one of the filming locations. Girona stood in for Braavos and parts of King's Landing. It was later announced that the seventh season would film in Northern Ireland, Spain and Iceland, with filming in Northern Ireland beginning in August 2016. The series filmed in the Spanish cities Seville, C\u00e1ceres, Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo, Santiponce, Zumaia and Bermeo. Spanish sources announced that the series would be filming the seventh season on Muriola Beach in Barrika, Las Atarazanas, the Royal Dockyards of Seville and at the shores of San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, an islet belonging to the city of Bermeo. The series returned to film at The Dark Hedges in Stranocum, which was previously used as the Kingsroad in the second season. Some scenes were filmed in Iceland. Filming also occurred in Dubrovnik, Croatia, which is used for location of King's Landing. The scene where Arya was reunited with Nymeria was filmed in Alberta, Canada.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nDeadline reported on June 21, 2016, that the five main cast members, Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Lena Headey, Emilia Clarke, and Kit Harington had been in contract negotiations for the final two seasons. It was reported that the cast members have increased their salary to $500,000 per episode for the seventh and eighth season. It was later reported that the actors had gone through a renegotiation, for which they had increased their salary to $1.1 million per episode for the last two seasons.\nOn August 31, 2016, Entertainment Weekly reported that Jim Broadbent had been cast for the seventh season in a \"significant\" role. It was announced that the role of Dickon Tarly has been recast, with Tom Hopper replacing Freddie Stroma, who had previously played the role in \"Blood of My Blood\". The seventh season sees the return of Mark Gatiss as Tycho Nestoris, who did not appear in the sixth season, Ben Hawkey as Hot Pie, who last appeared in the fourth season, and Joe Dempsie as Gendry, who last appeared in the third season and maintains his status as starring cast member. Members of the British indie pop band Bastille were reported to have filmed cameo appearances. British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran also makes a cameo appearance in the season. Guitarist/vocalist of American heavy metal band Mastodon, Brent Hinds, has also revealed he would have a cameo appearance. This is Hinds' second cameo in the series, following his appearance (along with bandmates Brann Dailor and Bill Kelliher) in the fifth season.\n\n\n=== Episodes ===\nOn April 21, 2016, HBO officially ordered the seventh season of Game of Thrones, just three days prior to the premiere of the show's sixth season. In a June 2016 interview with Variety, co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss revealed the seventh season would likely consist of fewer episodes, stating at the time of the interview that they were \"down to our final 13 episodes after this season. We're heading into the final lap.\" Director Jack Bender, who worked on the show's sixth season, said that the seventh season would consist of seven episodes. Benioff and Weiss stated that they were unable to produce 10 episodes in the show's usual 12 to 14 month time frame, as Weiss said \"It's crossing out of a television schedule into more of a mid-range movie schedule.\" HBO confirmed on July 18, 2016, that the seventh season would consist of seven episodes, and would premiere later than usual in mid-2017 because of the later filming schedule. Later it was confirmed that the season would debut on July 16. The seventh season of the series includes its longest episode, with the finale running for 81 minutes. The penultimate episode also runs for 71 minutes \u2013 around 16 minutes longer than an average Game of Thrones episode. The first five episodes mostly run longer than average (55 minutes), at 59, 59, 63, 50, and 59 minutes respectively. The previous longest episode in the series was the sixth-season finale, \"The Winds of Winter\", which ran for 69 minutes.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nRamin Djawadi returned as the composer of the show for the seventh season.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn Metacritic, the season (based on the first episode) has a score of 77 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the seventh season has a 95% approval rating from 42 critics with an average rating of 8.31 out of 10, and a 92% average episode score, with the site's consensus reading \"After a year-long wait, Game of Thrones roars back with powerful storytelling and a focused interest in its central characters -- particularly the female ones.\"\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\nThe series premiere surpassed 30 million viewers across all of the network's domestic platforms weeks after its release. The show's numbers continued to climb in other countries as well. In the UK, the premiere got up to 4.7 million viewers after seven days, setting a new record for Sky Atlantic. Compared to the previous season, HBO Asia saw an increases of between 24 percent to 50 percent. HBO Latin America saw a record viewership in the region, with a 29 percent climb. In Germany, the show went up 210 percent, in Russia it climbed 40 percent and in Italy it saw a 61 percent increase. In the United States, the finale was watched by 12.1 million viewers on its first airing on television, and 16.5 million when viewings on HBO Now and HBO Go apps are included. Over the season, the viewer numbers averaged at over 30 million per episode across all platforms.\n^1 Live +7 ratings were not available, so Live +3 ratings have been used instead.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Broadcast ===\nThe season was simulcast around the world by HBO and its broadcast partners in 186 countries. In some countries, it aired the day after its first release.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\nOn July 23, 2016, a teaser production trailer was released by HBO at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con. The trailer mostly consisted of voice overs, and shots of crew members creating sets and props. The first footage from the season was revealed in a new promotional video released by HBO highlighting its new and returning original shows for the coming year on November 28, 2016, showcasing Jon Snow, Sansa Stark and Arya Stark.\nOn March 1, 2017, HBO and Game of Thrones teamed up with Major League Baseball (MLB) for a cross-promotional partnership. At least 19 individual teams participated in this promotion. On March 8, 2017, HBO released the first promotional poster for the season ahead of the SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas, which teases the battle of \"ice vs. fire\". Showrunners Benioff and Weiss also spoke at the event, along with fellow cast members Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams.\nOn March 9, 2017, HBO hosted a live stream on the Game of Thrones Facebook page that revealed the premiere date for the seventh season as being July 16, 2017. It was accompanied by a teaser trailer. On March 30, 2017, the first official promo for the show was released, highlighting the thrones of Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and Cersei Lannister. On April 20, 2017, HBO released 15 official photos shot during the season. On May 22, 2017, HBO released several new photos from the new season. On May 23, 2017, HBO released the official posters featuring the Night King. The first official trailer for season 7 was released on May 24, 2017. The trailer set a world record for being the most viewed show trailer ever, being viewed 61 million times across digital platforms, in the first 24 hours. The second official trailer was released on June 21, 2017. The season premiere was screened at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on July 12, 2017.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in region 1 on December 12, 2017.\n\n\n=== Illegal distribution ===\nThe season premiere was pirated 90 million times in the first three days after it aired. On August 4, 2017, it was reported that, two days before its original broadcast, the fourth episode of the season was leaked online from Star India, one of HBO's international network partners. The leaked copy has the \"for internal viewing only\" watermark. On July 31, 2017, due to a security breach, HBO was the victim of 1.5 terabytes of stolen data. However, \"this was not related to this episode leak\", according to The Verge. On August 16, 2017, four days before its intended release, it was reported that HBO Spain and HBO Nordic accidentally allowed the sixth episode of the series on-demand viewing for one hour before being removed.\nData from piracy monitoring firm MUSO indicates that season seven was pirated more than one billion times mostly by unauthorized streaming, with torrent and direct downloads accounting for about 15 percent of this piracy. On average, each episode is estimated to have been pirated 140 million times, making Game of Thrones the most-pirated television series in 2017.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \u2013 (U.S.)\nOfficial website \u2013 (U.K.)\nGame of Thrones \u2013 The Viewers Guide on HBO.com\nMaking Game of Thrones on HBO.com\nList of Game of Thrones episodes on IMDb\nList of Game of Thrones episodes at TV.com",

            "content": "Henry \"Orator\" Hunt (6 November 1773 \u2013 15 February 1835) was a British radical speaker and agitator remembered as a pioneer of working-class radicalism and an important influence on the later Chartist movement. He advocated parliamentary reform and the repeal of the Corn Laws.\nHunt was born in Upavon, Wiltshire and became a prosperous farmer. He was first drawn into radical politics during the Napoleonic Wars, becoming a supporter of Francis Burdett. His talent for public speaking became noted in the electoral politics of Bristol, where he denounced the complacency of both the Whigs and the Tories, and proclaimed himself a supporter of democratic radicalism. It was thanks to his particular talents that a new programme beyond the narrow politics of the day made steady progress in the difficult years that followed the conclusion of the war with France.\nBecause of his rousing speeches at mass meetings held in Spa Fields in London in 1816\u201317 he became known as the 'Orator', a term of disparagement accorded by his enemies. He embraced a programme that included annual parliaments and universal suffrage, promoted openly and with none of the conspiratorial element of the old Jacobin clubs. The tactic he most favoured was that of 'mass pressure', which he felt, if given enough weight, could achieve reform without insurrection.\nAlthough his efforts at mass politics had the effect of radicalising large sections of the community unrepresented in Parliament, there were clear limits as to how far this could be taken. He was invited by the Patriotic Union Society, formed by the Manchester Observer, to be one of the scheduled speakers at a rally in Manchester on 16 August 1819, which turned into the Peterloo massacre. Arrested and convicted, the incident cost him more than two years in prison.\nThe debacle at Peterloo, caused by an over-reaction of the local Manchester authorities, added greatly to his prestige. Moral force was not sufficient in itself, and physical force entailed too great a risk. Although urged to do so after Peterloo, Hunt refused to give his approval to schemes for a full-scale insurrection. Thereby all momentum was lost, as more desperate souls turned to worn out cloak-and-dagger schemes, which surfaced in the Cato Street conspiracy.\n\nWhile in prison for his part in Peterloo, Hunt turned to writing, to putting his message across through a variety of forms, including an autobiography. After his release he attempted to recover some of his lost fortune by beginning new business ventures in London, which included the production and marketing of a roasted corn Breakfast Powder, the \"most salubrious and nourishing Beverage that can be substituted for the use of Tea and Coffee, which are always exciting, and frequently the most irritating to the Stomach and Bowels.\" He also made shoe-blacking bottles, which carried the slogan \"Equal Laws, Equal Rights, Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage, and the Ballot.\" Synthetic coal, intended specifically for the French market, was another of his schemes. After the July Revolution in 1830 he sent samples to Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette and other political heroes, along with fraternal greetings.\nBusiness interests notwithstanding, he still found time for practical politics, fighting battles over a whole range of issues, and always pushing for reform and accountability. In 1830 he became a member of Parliament for Preston defeating the future British Prime Minister Edward Stanley, but was defeated when standing for re-election in 1833. As a consistent champion of the working classes, a term he used with increasing frequency, he opposed the Whigs, both old and new, and the Reform Act 1832, which he believed did not go far enough in the extension of the franchise. He gave speeches addressed to the \"Working Classes and no other\", urging them to press for full equal rights. In 1832 he presented the first petition in support of women's suffrage to Parliament. It was received however with much ribald laughter and antagonism. Also in that year, he petitioned parliament on behalf of the radical preacher John Ward, who had been imprisoned for blasphemy.\nIn his opposition to the Reform Bill Orator Hunt revived the Great Northern Union, a pressure group he set up some years before, intended to unite the northern industrial workers behind a platform of full democratic reform; and it is in this specifically that the germs of Chartism can be detected. Worn out by his struggles he died in 1835.\nA monument to Hunt was erected in 1842 by \"the working people\", in Every Street, Manchester, in Scholefield's Chapel Yard. A \"spiral\" march was held on the anniversary of Peterloo, from Piccadilly around the town past the Peterloo site, down to Deansgate and through Ancoats to the monument. The monument's stonework deteriorated and it was demolished in 1888.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBelchem, John. \"Orator\" Hunt: Henry Hunt and English Working-Class Radicalism. Clarendon, 1985.

            "content": "John Knox Bokwe (15 March 1855 \u2013 22 February 1922) was a South African journalist, Presbyterian minister and one of the most celebrated Xhosa hymn writers and musician. He is best known for his compositions Vuka Deborah, Plea for Africa, and Marriage Song.\nAs a young boy, Bokwe ran errands and worked for Dr. James Stewart's family. It was also in their house that he learnt to play the organ and the piano. In the same year Dr. Stewart took him into the general office of the Lovedale Mission as messenger, and later as his secretary, a post he filled until he left Lovedale in 1897. Meanwhile, in 1869, he was admitted into the mission's college department, where he was to remain until 1872.\nAs an established writer, he joined John Tengo Jabavu in producing the newspaper Imvo Zabantsundu (\"African Opinion\") in King Williams Town. He played a role in the foundation in 1916 of what is now the University of Fort Hare (originally the South African Native College) in South-Eastern Cape Province.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nJohn Knox Bokwe was born in Ntselamanzi near Lovedale, southeastern Cape Province and was the youngest child of Cholwephi and Lena Bokwe. His father was one of the first students to be enrolled at the Lovedale Mission school, while his mother was daughter of Nxe, one of the first converts of Ntsikana.\nBokwe first went to school at the age of eight or nine, and was taught by William Kobe Ntsikana, grandson of the prophet Ntsikana. In 1867, when he was twelve, he encountered the Stewart family with which he was to become closely associated. It was also in their house that he learnt to play the organ and the piano. In 1866 he was admitted to the preparatory classes at the Lovedale Institution. He continued on to the college in 1869 and finished his schooling four years later.\nBokwe met a young girl, Lettie Ncheni, who was also employed in the Stewart household. She worked there from 1868 to 1873 while attending night classes and from 1871 attended as a day scholar. The two got married in 1878 when Lettie returned from Scotland where she had accompanied Mrs. Stewart for three years.\n\n\n== Lovedale Mission: 1867\u20131897 ==\nDr. Stewart took him into the general office of the Lovedale Mission as messenger in 1867, and later as his secretary. In 1869, he was admitted into the mission's college department. During this time, his love for reading and writing was kindled. As a student, Bokwe was active in the literary society, of which he became chairman.\nIn 1870 he helped in the printing and production of iNdaba, a Xhosa newspaper produced at Lovedale. When, in 1874, Lovedale obtained its own postal service, Bokwe was appointed manager, and later became head of the telegraph office. He also became conductor of the mission's brass band. From 1875 Bokwe started to compose hymns. His collected compositions were produced in book form in 1885. In 1892, at the invitation of friends in Scotland and England, Bokwe visited these countries, preaching sermons in churches, and telling his listeners about the work of the Lovedale Mission.\n\n\n== Imvo Zabantsundu newspaper: 1898\u20131899 ==\nIn 1897, after 24 years of service, Bokwe left Lovedale Mission to collaborate with John Tengo Jabavu in producing the Xhosa newspaper Imvo Zabantsundu (\"African Opinion\") in King Williamstown. Many Xhosa South Africans were critical of the views expressed by Jabavu, in part because Jabavu was an Mfengu, a group regarded as subordinate to and unrepresentative of the Xhosa people. iZwi la Bantu (\"The Voice of the People\") was founded and published in East London, under the editorship of N. C. Mhala, in opposition to the Imvo Zabantsundu (\"African Opinion\") newspaper. It was to discourage these accusations that Bokwe, a Xhosa, went to join Jabavu. Bokwe's two years on the newspaper, however, were most frustrating and unhappy and this began to tell on his health. In 1899 he left the Jabavu and the newspaper business for his wife's home at Tsomo, in the Transkei, to recuperate.\n\n\n== Missionary and political work: 1900\u20131920 ==\n\nWhile recuperating in Tsomo, Bokwe realized that his real calling was to be a minister, not a journalist. He left Tsomo for the town of Ugie in 1900, where he served first as an evangelist, and then as a probationer. In 1906 he was ordained as a minister of the United Free Church. When Bokwe first arrived at Ugie, there was no school for either black or white in the district. He opened a school for children in the town, at first with no government grant. He then went out into the outlying areas, opening schools and churches.\nIn 1906, through his efforts, the town of Ugie built its first European school. He also served as town clerk. After years of hard work, his schools flourished until, under the provisions of the Native Private Location Act, African squatters on white farms were turned out, and all but two of Bokwe's schools and churches were obliged to close.\n\n\n=== Fort Hare College and politics ===\nIn 1905 Bokwe became a member of the committee, composed of Africans and members of the United Free Church of Scotland, which sought, as a memorial to the late Dr. Stewart, to establish a college of higher education for South African men and women. As a result, largely on the strength of donations collected among the people, Fort Hare College was opened in 1916. In the same year Bokwe was elected general secretary of the Native Teachers Association in the Transkei. Throughout his later life he maintained ties with many prominent figures in the Cape and took an active part in public affairs.\n\n\n== Last years: 1921\u20131922 ==\nHe was forced to retire in 1920 because of failing health and moved nearer to Lovedale again. In the same year, already in poor health he appeared before the Native Affairs Commission. His last years were spent helping Dr. Henderson, the principal, to translate the metrical psalms into Xhosa. He died at his home at Ntselamanzi, near Lovedale, on February 22, 1922. He was buried in the Gaga Cemetery, alongside other missionaries associated with Lovedale.\n\n\n== Lineage ==\nBokwe was married twice and had five children:\nBarbour Bokwe,\nRoseberry Tandwefika Bokwe, (1900\u20131963) qualified as a doctor in 1933 and later became active in the African National Congress (ANC).\nSelbourne Bokwe,\nFrieda Bokwe, married \"ZK\" (Zachariah Keodirelang) Matthews, the educationalist, church leader and African nationalist.\nPearl Bokwe, Pearl became the wife of Mark Radebe, the composer.\nWaterstone Bokwe.\nFreida Bokwe was the first African woman to earn a degree at a South African institution and is the grandmother of Naledi Pandor, an ANC member of parliament.\n\n\n== Other notes ==\nJohn Knox Bokwe's name appears on an autograph quilt made as a local church fundraiser, about 1894. The original quilt is on display at the National Museum of Australia. This rare autograph quilt is one of the earliest known signature quilts in Australia. It includes about 650 embroidered signatures, names, monograms or initials. Only a small number, including prominent figures in late 1890s elite Melbourne society and missionaries in Australia, England and South Africa, have been identified.\n\n\n== References ==",

His twin sister Maya, a talented musician, feels the most guilt and is forced to act as a family caregiver at the expense of career opportunities. Bullied at school, younger son Ido responds by obsessively filming himself with a video camera and attempting dangerous feats. The baby sister, Bar, is woefully neglected. Preoccupied with their own misery, the family is barely a family anymore. When another tragedy strikes, will they be able to support one another?\n\n\n== External links ==\nBroken Wings on IMDb",

            "content": "Taavi Peetre (5 July 1983 \u2013 11 September 2010) was an Estonian shot putter and discus thrower. He represented his country at two Olympic Games (in 2004 and 2008) and also took part in the World Championships in Athletics on two occasions. His personal best shot put mark of 20.33 m is the second best by an Estonian thrower after Heino Sild. His personal best in discus throw was 60.84 m, achieved in April 2010 in Denton, Texas, USA. He died in 2010 after a boat accident.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in K\u00e4ina Parish, his first major international competition was the 1999 World Youth Championships in Athletics, where he was tenth in the discus throw qualifiers of the competition's inaugural edition. Peetre finished ninth in the shot put final at the 2002 World Junior Championships, having already thrown a national junior record of 17.71 m earlier that year, and also competed in the qualifiers of the discus contest. He improved his best shot put mark to 19.02 m the following year and made his first Olympic appearance at the 2004 Olympic Games.\nHaving changed his focus to primarily the shot put, the 2005 season marked a further breakthrough into the senior ranks. He represented Estonia at the 2005 European Athletics Indoor Championships and then at the 2005 World Championships later in the season, but did not get past the qualifiers on either occasion. He enjoyed success at lower level competitions, however, winning shot put silver medals at the 2005 European Athletics U23 Championships, 2005 Universiade, and in the A League of the 2005 European Cup.\nHe improved his indoor shot put best in February 2006, throwing 19.81 m, and was eleventh at the European Cup Winter Throwing. He retained his runner-up place in the A League section of the 2006 European Cup, but managed only eleventh in the qualifiers of his first continental outdoor championships, the 2006 European Athletics Championships. A low-key 2007 was highlighted by a win at the national championships and eighteenth in the qualifiers at the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships.\nHe returned to top form in 2008, throwing over sixty metres in the discus for the first time and putting a season's best of 20.22 m in the shot just prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. At his second Olympic shot put competition he had a best mark of 19.57 m but failed to reach the final round. In 2009 he regained the national shot put title and gave his best performance at a global event at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics: his mark of 19.91 m was the fifth best of his qualification group, but this was not enough to progress to the final. He achieved a personal best in the shot put of 20.33 m in July 2010 in Viljandi, Estonia. His last major international championships was the 2010 European Athletics Championships, where he threw 19.42 m for seventh place in the qualifying round.\nOn 11 September 2010, Peetre drowned in Lake Tamula during a fishing trip with friends.\n\n\n== Major competitions ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTaavi Peetre profile at IAAF",

He was one of the most important sources for Serbian epic poetry recorded by Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107. Podrugovi\u0107 did not sing but used to 'speak' his poems; he understood and felt the poems and thought about what he said.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPodrugovi\u0107's family was from the village of Kazanci in the municipality of Gacko. Te\u0161an Podrugovi\u0107 was about forty years old when he first began collaborating with Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107. As a youth in Bosnia, Podrugovi\u0107 killed a Muslim who had raped a girl in his family. He fled to become a hajduk, then joined the first Serbian uprising under Kara\u0111or\u0111e in 1804. He fought bravely, but quarreled with his commanding officer and left the army to cross the Danube into Austrian-occupied Srem after the Ottomans recaptured Belgrade. He made his living as a guslar reciting epic poems and, as soon as the Second Serbian Uprising broke out in 1815, he joined the forces of Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107. Podrugovi\u0107 considered fighting to be more important than reciting poetry at the time.\n\n\n== Songs ==\nVuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 recorded for the first time many songs sung by Podrugovi\u0107. The poem about Musa Kesed\u017eija, named Marko Kraljevi\u0107 and Musa Kesed\u017eija, recited by Podrugovi\u0107 was recorded for the first time in Sremski Karlovci in 1815 by Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107. The song about General Vu\u010da was also recorded by Karad\u017ei\u0107, based on the singing of Podrugovi\u0107.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDimitrije Karaman\nFilip Vi\u0161nji\u0107\n\u017divana Antonijevi\u0107\nOld Rashko\nPetar Perunovi\u0107\nMarko Utvi\u0107\nBlind Jeca (Jelisaveta Markovi\u0107, called \"Blind Jeca,\" was \u017divana's pupil)\nStepanija\nDjuro Milutinovi\u0107 (1773-1844)\nMilia\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Mike Tyson vs. Mitch Green, billed as \"New York Is Busting Out\", was a professional boxing match contested on May 20, 1986.\n\n\n== Background ==\nMike Tyson was 19 years old and undefeated when he met former heavyweight contender James \"Quick\" Tillis in his 20th professional bout. Tyson had won all his 19 previous fights by way of knockout, while Tillis had lost four of his previous five fights and came into the fight as a huge underdog. Tillis, however, put on a good effort and was able to take Tyson the full 10 rounds, the first time in Tyson's professional career; Tyson won by unanimous decision. Only four days later, it was announced that Tyson would next face Mitch \"Blood\" Green, who was ranked one spot ahead of Tyson on the WBC heavyweight standings, on May 20 in Madison Square Garden. Despite Green being higher than Tyson in the rankings, there was a huge dispartity in the fighter's purse, Tyson was guaranteed $250,000 while Green was due to make only $30,000. Because of this, Green threatened to pull out of the fight only one day before it was to take place unless his purse was increased. However, after HBO executive Ross Greenberg informed Green that a shot at the WBC heavyweight title was on the line, Green chose to continue on with the fight.\n\n\n== The Fight ==\nThough Tyson was in control for most of the fight, he was unable to record a knockdown over Green. In what would be a precursor to future Tyson fights, most notably his championship fights the following year against James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith and Tony Tucker, Green clinched Tyson on a regular basis in an effort to reduce the effectiveness of Tyson's power punches. Green, however, offered very little offensively and Tyson was able to win a lopsided unanimous decision by two scores of 9\u20131 and one score of 8\u20132.\n\n\n== 1988 Streetfight ==\nThough the two fighters would never again face each other in a boxing ring, Tyson and Green were involved in a high-profile street fight two years later, by which time Tyson was the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion. On August 24, 1988, Green confronted Tyson at Dapper Dan's in Harlem, claiming that Tyson's promoter Don King owed him money. The argument then escalated into a physical confrontation during which Tyson landed a straight right hand across Green's face, completely shutting Green's left eye and opening a cut across his nose that required five stitches. Tyson, however, would not walk away unscathed, as his right hand was fractured during the melee, causing his scheduled October fight against Frank Bruno to be pushed back.\n\n\n== References ==",

The neighborhood is named for the Mount Lookout Observatory, which moved to the neighborhood in 1873. The population was 4,814 at the 2010 census.\nMount Lookout's lively business district is referred to as Mount Lookout Square. Local restaurants and bars fuel a vibrant nightlife, while specialty shops and small business serve daytime needs. Mount Lookout Tavern anchors the east end of the Square and attracts college students from the several area universities (including the University of Cincinnati, Xavier University and Northern Kentucky University), as well as twenty and thirty-something working professionals. Zip's Cafe, established 1926, is one of the more well-known restaurants on the Square as its burger is continually ranked as a top burger in Cincinnati (5th best in 2015 by Cincinnati Magazine).\nMount Lookout is home to Ault Park, although the nearby neighborhood of Hyde Park also considers it part of their community. The area contains a neighborhood swim club named Mt. Lookout Swim and Tennis Club, which is run by Swimsafe Management. Kilgour School, Cardinal Pacelli School and St. Ursula Villa School are the only schools located within the community.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMt.

            "content": "The Breitling Jet Team is the largest civilian aerobatic display team in Europe. Based in Dijon, France, it flies seven Czech Aero L-39 Albatros jets.\nThe team flies a display lasting 18\u201320 minutes that includes formation flying, opposition passes, solo routines, and synchronized maneuvers. The team performs across Europe and the Middle East, with multiple engagements per year, including international airshows and Breitling corporate events.\n\n\n== History and origins ==\nThe Breitling Jet Team was established in early 2003 with four L-39s. With the addition of two aircraft in 2004 and three in 2008, the team now has a total of nine jets. The Team's roots go back to 1980.\n\n\n=== Patrouille Martini ===\nJacques Bothelin, the team leader, began performing in airshows in 1980 with a French-designed Mudry CAP 10 aircraft. In 1982, he began to fly as part of a team of three SIAI-Marchetti SF260s sponsored by Martini. The team was called Patrouille Martini, (patrouille is French for 'patrol' or 'team'). Also at that time, Jacques Bothelin established Apache Aviation at the team's Darois home base to handle the operational aspects of running a full-time aerobatic team. The Martini Team flew for five years in the SF260s, until the team took delivery of Swiss-manufactured Pilatus PC-7s, in 1988.\n\n\n=== Patrouille Ecco ===\nIn 1990, new regulations in France banning the advertising of alcohol forced Martini to withdraw its sponsorship. Ecco, a temporary employment agency, replaced Martini and the team was renamed Patrouille Ecco for the 1991 season. The team's colors changed from Martini's white to Ecco's green and white, and a fourth PC-7 was added. During the 1990s, Patrouille Ecco performed at airshows around Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.\n\n\n=== Patrouille Adecco ===\nIn 1997, Ecco merged with a Swiss firm, Adia, forming Adecco. The team's name changed to Patrouille Adecco, and its colours shifted to Adecco's red and white. In 1998, the team suffered a setback when Adecco pulled out of its sponsorship. Jacques Bothelin and Philippe Laloix flew during 1999\u20132001 in two PC-7s as \"Les Apaches\"; the name was derived from the Apache Aviation firm.\n\n\n=== Khalifa Jet Team ===\nIn late 2001, a group of Algerian companies founded by Rafik Khalifa offered to sponsor Apache Aviation. The PC-7s were sold, and L-39 jets arrived as their replacement. The new team was known as the \"Khalifa Jet Team\", launching in March 2002, and making its airshow debut in May 2002. Over the summer of 2002, the team worked up from a two-ship formation to a four-aircraft team. Over the course of 2002, the team appeared at 43 events in six European countries.\n\n\n=== Breitling ===\nIn early 2003, Khalifa pulled out of the sponsorship. Breitling SA stepped into the breach and invested in the team. This allowed the outfit to expand from four planes to the seven-ship formation it flies today. In 2015, the team embarked on a two-year tour of North America with performances at notable events like the Sun 'n Fun Fly-In, the Vectren Dayton Air Show, Jones Beach, NY, Rhode Island, AirVenture at Oshkosh and the Abbotsford International Airshow as well as the Canadian International Air Show in Canada. Their final North American performance concluded on October 23, 2016 at the Huntington Beach Airshow in Huntington Beach, California.\n\n\n=== Incidents ===\nOn 15 September 2012, the Breitling Jet Team #2 crew had to eject, and the L-39 jet crashed on a field near Kleine Brogel Air Base. Nobody was injured.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nBreitling Jet Team website\nBlog about Breitling Jet Team (fr)\nVideo about Breitling Jet Team in Mexican TV (Spanish)",

            "content": "Linda Lee Cadwell (born Linda C. Emery; March 21, 1945) is an American teacher, best known as the widow of martial arts master and actor Bruce Lee.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nShe was born in Everett, Washington, the daughter of Vivian R. (Hester) and Everett Emery. Her family was Baptist and of Swedish, Irish, and English descent. She met Bruce Lee while she was attending Garfield High School, where Bruce came to give a Kung Fu demonstration; he was attending the University of Washington at the time. Eventually, she became one of his Kung Fu students when she was attending the University of Washington, studying to become a teacher.\nShe took Kung Fu lessons from him while attending college. They married on August 17, 1964. Linda was a few credits short from graduation. They had two children together, Brandon Lee and Shannon Lee. Bruce Lee had opened his own Kung Fu school at the time and was teaching Wing Chun, which would later serve as the basis for Jeet Kune Do. Bruce Lee died suddenly on July 20, 1973 of an allergic reaction to an analgesic.\nLinda was married to Tom Bleecker in 1988, and they divorced in 1990. She married stockbroker Bruce Cadwell in 1991 and they live in Rancho Mirage, California.\nHer son Brandon Lee, an actor, died in a shooting accident on a movie set while filming The Crow on March 31, 1993, 19 years after his father's death.\nLee Cadwell has continued to promote Bruce Lee's martial art Jeet Kune Do. She retired in 2001, and her daughter Shannon (who is now in charge of the Lee family estate), together with son-in-law Ian Keasler, run the Bruce Lee Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to teaching Bruce Lee's philosophy on martial arts and his writing on philosophy.\n\n\n=== Books ===\nLee Cadwell wrote the 1975 book Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew (ISBN 0-446-89407-9), on which the 1993 feature film Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story was based. She was portrayed by actress Lauren Holly in the film adaptation. Lee Cadwell also wrote the 1989 book The Bruce Lee Story (ISBN 0-89750121-7).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Web Site of the Lee Family\nLinda Lee Cadwell on IMDb",

            "content": "How to Beat the High Cost of Living is a 1980 American comedy film starring Jane Curtin, Susan Saint James and Jessica Lange. Also in the cast are Dabney Coleman, Fred Willard, Richard Benjamin, Eddie Albert, Cathryn Damon, and a cameo by Jane Curtin's fellow Saturday Night Live co-star Garrett Morris. The movie was released in summer of 1980, grossing approximately US $7.5 million.\nThis was the final American International Pictures production before its merger with Filmways.\n\n\n== Exposition ==\nJane (Susan Saint James), Elaine (Jane Curtin), and Louise (Jessica Lange) are suburbanites in Eugene, Oregon. These three women, friends since high school, are currently all struggling with money.\nJane is divorced, trying to cope with the man she is dating, Robert (Fred Willard), her newly single father (Eddie Albert), who moves in with Jane after his wife leaves him for another woman, and her young children, who need dental work. Jane learns she is pregnant, which makes Robert unhappy since both he and Jane are nearly broke.\nElaine's husband, an architect, has left her for a younger woman. He has also left her with no money, no credit cards, and lots of bills, all of which are very overdue, leading to a scene with a man at the power company (Garrett Morris). Depressed, she gets drunk and her car is pulled over by police officer Jack (Dabney Coleman). Elaine makes a pass at him, trying to get out of the ticket. When he accepts, then reveals he is married, Elaine smacks him with her purse. She makes it clear that if she is arrested by Jack, her one phone call will be to his wife.\nLouise owns an antiques store. Unfortunately, it's not a very successful operation, so she is always accepting funds from her veterinarian husband (Richard Benjamin) to keep the store open. While they are in bed one evening, in the early process of making love, the doorbell rings. Louise is served a court order and learns her husband plans on suing her to force her into bankruptcy to wipe away the enormous debt she has incurred.\nThe women become desperate. Elaine even tries a yard sale to raise money, selling her husband's possessions, including his deodorant. With nowhere else to turn, Jane, Elaine and Louise notice a \"money ball\" at the mall, filled with cash, and hatch a scheme to pull off a daring robbery by land and by sea.\n\n\n== Main plot ==\nAt the peak of their woes, Elaine visits the local mall, where an acquaintance (Cathryn Damon) has coaxed her into helping out with staging a community pageant. Elaine stares at a large, clear ball soon due to hold thousands of dollars in a giant cash \"give away\" and formulates the idea of stealing the money. She calls Jane and Louise to the mall, where they scheme to steal the money by drilling a hole beneath the ball and sucking out as much cash as possible with a high-powered vacuum, then escaping via the river behind the mall.\nDespite getting caught by officer Jack in the act of stealing items needed for the heist, Elaine again manages to sweet-talk her way out of being taken to jail. On the evening of the heist, each woman has an unexpected distraction, but finally find their way to the mall. Jane and Louise go to work beneath the cash ball while Elaine readies herself to throw the switch to the mall's lighting controls, aiding their escape. Unfortunately, a minor occurrence nearly causes mall security to notice the noise caused by Jane and Louise stealing the money. With no other way to distract the guards and shoppers, Elaine begins to rant about the high cost of living and how so many things cost \"the shirt off your back -- and even THAT'S not enough!\" She begins an impromptu striptease, exposing her bosom to the crowd.\nAn indoor light pole falls directly into the ball, sending cash flowing out into the mall, driving people into a frenzy to collect it. During the uproar above, Jane and Louise make their escape to the river with two large trash bags filled with cash, only to have their canoe tip over when Louise stands up. They both fall in, and Louise can't swim, leaving Jane to decide to save the cash or her friend. She saves Louise and the two bags float away.\nHours later, the sun is rising and both Jane and Louise are still on the bank of the river, crestfallen over the loss of the money, joined by Elaine, wrapped in a blanket. The three begin to argue, but Louise notices a bag floating by and all three of them dive in after it.\nAt the film's end, Jane has married Robert and gotten her father a condo in a senior's complex; Louise reopens her store and takes back her husband, whom she'd left; and Elaine begins dating the officer, with enough secret money to bring her back to the lifestyle she'd been accustomed to.\n\n\n== Production ==\nRobert Kaufman had written the script in 1971-1972, and Kaufman (and then later with Jere Henshaw) had 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., and Universal Pictures, all interested in the project if he could land major stars. Kaufman and Henshaw could not get the movie made until Henshaw got hired at American International Pictures as executive senior vice president in charge of production. The pair first made Love at First Bite, this success gave them the go ahead to make How to Beat the High Co$t of Living with younger, lesser-known names.\nMost of the film was shot in and around Eugene, Oregon. Eugene was chosen because they needed an indoor mall next to a river. The mall used for filming was the Valley River Center, situated next to the Willamette River. The budget for the project was $4.75 million with a 42-day shooting schedule. Filming began on September 5, 1979 and wrapped up in late October.\nWhile filming an outdoor scene in Eugene, a middle-aged man drove by in a car and yelled, \"Jane, you ignorant slut!,\" in reference to Curtin and Dan Aykroyd doing their Point/Counterpoint segment on Saturday Night Live, and the crew cracked up laughing.\nCurtin and Saint James who would go on to star together in the sitcom Kate & Allie.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSusan Saint James as Jane\nJane Curtin as Elaine\nJessica Lange as Louise\nDabney Coleman as Jack\nRichard Benjamin as Albert\nFred Willard as Robert\nEddie Albert as Max\nCathryn Damon as Natalie\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHow to Beat the High Cost of Living on IMDb\nHow to Beat the High Cost of Living at the TCM Movie Database\nHow to Beat the High Cost of Living at Rotten Tomatoes\nHow to Beat the High Cost of Living at AllMovie",

            "content": "Multicultural India has developed its discourse on sexuality differently based on its distinct regions with their own unique cultures. However, one common aspect remains: the existence of a subtle conspiracy of silence and taboos that clouds the Indian world of sexual desires and expressions. The origins of this silence towards India's rich contributions to sexuality and shunning of it almost are to be found in the repurcussions of the colonial rule and of the Bible  This shaped the attitude and opinions Indian people hold about their sexuality today; one that is hegemonically hetereosexual and must aim at procreation after marriage. However, from the second half of the 20th century, several significant voices have challenged this silence imposed over sexuality and questioned the roles assigned to desires within the socio-political and artistic fields. Many recently published studies confirm the richness of India's erotic past and popular voices are now spotlighting this for the masses to know. A myriad of folk tales, sculptures like those in Khajuraho, religious poetry and scholary documents reveal homoerotic content and how love and sex between women, men, gods, semi-gods and goddesses was expressed.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe seeming contradictions of Indian attitudes towards sex (more broadly - sexuality) can be best explained through the context of history. India played a role in shaping understandings of sexuality, and it could be argued that one of the first pieces of literature that treated \"Kama\" as a science came from the Indian subcontinent. It may be argued that historically, India pioneered the use of sexual education through various art forms like sculptures, paintings, and pieces of literature. As in all societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in \"self-gratification\" lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Moreover, there are distinct cultural differences seen through the course of history across India.\n\n\n== Ancient times ==\n\nThe origins of the current Indian culture can be traced back to the Indus Valley civilisation, which was contemporaneous with the ancient Egyptian and Sumerian civilisations, around 2700 BCE. During this period, the first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of Hinduism, Buddhism. These ancient texts, the Rig Veda among few others, reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. The epics of ancient India, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, which may have been first composed as early as 500 BCE, had a huge effect on the culture of Asia, influencing later Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan culture and South East Asian culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions. It seems that polygamy was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice both polyandry and polygyny as a way of preserving dynastic succession.\nNudity in art was considered acceptable in southern India, as shown by the paintings at Ajanta and the sculptures of the time. It is likely that as in most countries with tropical climates, Indians from some regions did not need to wear clothes, and other than for fashion, there was no practical need to cover the upper half of the body. This is supported by historical evidence, which shows that men in many parts of ancient India mostly dressed only the lower half of their bodies with clothes and upper part of body was covered by gold and precious stones, jewellery, while women used to wear traditional sarees made of silk and expensive clothes as a symbol of their wealth.\n\nAs Indian civilisation further developed and the writing of the Upanishads around 500 BCE, it was somewhere between the 1st and 6th centuries that the Kama Sutra, originally known as Vatsyayana Kamasutram ('Vatsyayana's Aphorisms on Love'), was written. This philosophical work on kama shastra, or 'science of love', was intended as both an exploration of human desire, including infidelity, and a technical guide to pleasing a sexual partner within a marriage. This is not the only example of such a work in ancient India, but is the most widely known in modern times. It is probably during this period that the text spread to ancient China, along with Buddhist scriptures, where Chinese versions were written.\nIt is also during 10th century to 12th century that some of India's most famous ancient works of art were produced, often freely depicting romantic themes and situations. Examples of this include the depiction of Apsaras, roughly equivalent to nymphs or sirens in European and Arabic mythology, on some ancient temples. The best and most famous example of this can be seen at the Khajuraho complex in central India built around 9th to 12th century.\n\n\n== Colonial era ==\n\nAlthough the Portuguese and French had managed to set up some small enclaves in India, such as Goa, where the Catholic inquisition forcibly converted some of the population of the small region to Catholicism, it was the arrival of the British, who managed to annex the entire Indian subcontinent through alliances with various monarchs, that had the largest effect on the culture of India and its attitudes to sex. Rule was indirect at first through the East India Company whose administrators did not necessarily interfere extensively and even took advantage of the tattered remnants of Hindu liberalism in sexual matters, for example through liaisons and by maintaining de facto wives. At the same time there were significant number of orientalists who saw India as a great civilisation, invented the field of Indology, and advocated a more accepting point of view.\nA number of movements were set up by prominent citizens, such as the Brahmo Samaj in Bengal and the Prarthana Samaj in Bombay Presidency, to work for the 'reform' of Indian private and public life. Paradoxically while this new consciousness led to the promotion of education for women and (eventually) a raise in the age of consent and reluctant acceptance of remarriage for widows, it also produced a puritanical attitude to sex even within marriage and the home. The liberality of pre-colonial India had also respected the home and relationships.\n\n\n== Current issues ==\nConservative views of sexuality are now the norm in the modern republic of India, and South Asia in general. It is often argued that this is partly related to the effect of colonial influence, as well as to the puritanical elements of Islam in countries like Pakistan (e.g. the Islamic revivalist movements, which has influenced many Muslims in Pakistan and Bangladesh). However, such views were also prevalent in the pre-colonial era, especially since the advent of Islam in India which brought purdah as ideal for Muslim women. Before the gradual spread of Islam largely through the influence of Sufis, there seems to be evidence of liberal attitudes towards sexuality and nudity in art. However, scholars debate the degree to which Islam, as a mass and varied phenomenon was responsible for this shift.\nWhile during the 1960s and 1970s in the west, many people discovered the ancient culture of sexual liberalism in India as a source for western free love movements, and neo-Tantric philosophy, India itself is currently the more prudish culture, embodying Victorian sensibilities that were abandoned decades ago in their country of origin. However, with increased exposure to world culture due to globalisation, and the proliferation of progressive ideas due to greater education and wealth, India is beginning to go through a western-style sexual revolution of its own, especially in cosmopolitan cities.\n\n\n=== Modern India ===\n\nModern issues that affect India, as part of the sexual revolution, have become points of argument between conservative and liberal forces, such as political parties and religious pressure groups. These issues are also matters of ethical importance in a nation where freedom and equality are guaranteed in the constitution.\n\n\n=== Sexuality in popular entertainment ===\n\nThe entertainment industry is an important part of modern India, and is expressive of Indian society in general. Historically, Indian television and film has lacked the frank depiction of sex; until recently, even kissing scenes were considered taboo. On the other hand, rape scenes or scenes showing sexual assault were shown. Currently, some Indian states show soft-core sexual scenes and nudity in films, whilst other areas do not. Mainstream films are still largely catered for the masses.\n\n\n=== Pornography ===\n\nThe distribution and production of pornography are both illegal in India; however, accessing pornography in private is not. Regardless, softcore films have been common since the late 1970s, and many directors have produced them. Magazine publications like Debonair (magazine), Fantasy, Chastity, Royal Magazine, and Dafa 302 exist in India, and more than 50 million Indians are believed to see porn on a daily basis.\nThe Information Technology Act, Chapter XI Paragraph 67, the Government of India clearly considers online pornography as a punishable offence. The CEO of the Indian subsidiary of eBay was charged with various criminal offences for allowing the trading of a CD on the website that contained pornography.\n\n\n=== Sex industry ===\n\nWhile trade in sex was frowned upon in ancient India, it was tolerated and regulated so as to reduce the damage that it could do. Unfortunately, however, the stigmatisation that has arisen in modern times has left the many poor sex workers with problems of exploitation and rampant infection, including AIDS, and worse, it has allowed a huge people-trafficking industry, like that of Eastern Europe, to take hold. Many poor young women are kidnapped from villages and sold into sexual slavery. There have been some recent efforts to regulate the Indian sex industry.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of human sexuality\nHomosexuality in India\nHomosexuality and Hinduism\nHomosexuality and Sikhism\nKamashastra\nNon-westernized concepts of male sexuality\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlain Dani\u00e9lou.

            "content": "Metamorphism is the change of minerals or geologic texture (distinct arrangement of minerals) in pre-existing rocks (protoliths), without the protolith melting into liquid magma (a solid-state change). The change occurs primarily due to heat, pressure, and the introduction of chemically active fluids. The chemical components and crystal structures of the minerals making up the rock may change even though the rock remains a solid. Changes at or just beneath Earth's surface due to weathering or diagenesis are not classified as metamorphism. Metamorphism typically occurs between diagenesis (max. 200\u00b0C), and melting (~850\u00b0C).\nThree types of metamorphism exist: contact, dynamic, and regional. Metamorphism produced with increasing pressure and temperature conditions is known as prograde metamorphism. Conversely, decreasing temperatures and pressure characterize retrograde metamorphism.\n\n\n== Solid state recrystallization and neocrystalization ==\nMetamorphic rocks can change without melting. Heat causes atomic bonds to break, and the atoms move and form new bonds with other atoms, creating new minerals with different chemical components or crystalline structures (neocrystallization), or enabling recrystallization. When pressure is applied, somewhat flattened grains that orient in the same direction have a more stable configuration.\n\n\n== Limits ==\nThe temperature lower limit on what is considered to be a metamorphic process is generally considered to be 100 \u2013 200 \u00b0C; this excludes diagenetic changes due to compaction and the formation of sedimentary rocks. There is no agreement on a pressure lower limit for metamorphism; some argue that changes in barometric pressure are not metamorphic, but some types of metamorphism can occur at extremely low pressures.\nThe upper boundary of metamorphic conditions is related to the onset of melting processes in the rock. The maximum temperature for metamorphism is typically 700 \u2013 900 \u00b0C, depending on the pressure and on the composition of the rock. Migmatites are rocks formed at this upper limit, which contains pods and veins of material that has started to melt but has not fully segregated from the refractory residue. Since the 1980s it has been recognized that rocks are rarely dry enough and of a refractory enough composition to record without melting \"ultra-high\" metamorphic temperatures of 900 \u2013 1100 \u00b0C.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Regional ===\nRegional or Barrovian metamorphism covers large areas of continental crust typically associated with mountain ranges, particularly those associated with convergent tectonic plates or the roots of previously eroded mountains. Conditions producing widespread regionally metamorphosed rocks occur during an orogenic event. The collision of two continental plates or island arcs with continental plates produce the extreme compressional forces required for the metamorphic changes typical of regional metamorphism. These orogenic mountains are later eroded, exposing the intensely deformed rocks typical of their cores. The conditions within the subducting slab as it plunges toward the mantle in a subduction zone also produce regional metamorphic effects, characterized by paired metamorphic belts. The techniques of structural geology are used to unravel the collisional history and determine the forces involved. Regional metamorphism can be described and classified into metamorphic facies or metamorphic zones of temperature/pressure conditions throughout the orogenic terrane.\n\n\n=== Contact (thermal) ===\n\nContact metamorphism occurs typically around intrusive igneous rocks as a result of the temperature increase caused by the intrusion of magma into cooler country rock. The area surrounding the intrusion where the contact metamorphism effects are present is called the metamorphic aureole. Contact metamorphic rocks are usually known as hornfels. Rocks formed by contact metamorphism may not present signs of strong deformation and are often fine-grained.\nContact metamorphism is greater adjacent to the intrusion and dissipates with distance from the contact. The size of the aureole depends on the heat of the intrusion, its size, and the temperature difference with the wall rocks. Dikes generally have small aureoles with minimal metamorphism whereas large ultramafic intrusions can have significantly thick and well-developed contact metamorphism.\nThe metamorphic grade of an aureole is measured by the peak metamorphic mineral which forms in the aureole. This is usually related to the metamorphic temperatures of pelitic or aluminosilicate rocks and the minerals they form.The metamorphic grades of aureoles are andalusite hornfels, sillimanite hornfels, pyroxene hornfels.\nMagmatic fluids coming from the intrusive rock may also take part in the metamorphic reactions. An extensive addition of magmatic fluids can significantly modify the chemistry of the affected rocks. In this case the metamorphism grades into metasomatism. If the intruded rock is rich in carbonate the result is a skarn. Fluorine-rich magmatic waters which leave a cooling granite may often form greisens within and adjacent to the contact of the granite. Metasomatic altered aureoles can localize the deposition of metallic ore minerals and thus are of economic interest.\nA special type of contact metamorphism, associated with fossil fuel fires, is known as pyrometamorphism.\n\n\n=== Hydrothermal ===\nHydrothermal metamorphism is the result of the interaction of a rock with a high-temperature fluid of variable composition. The difference in composition between an existing rock and the invading fluid triggers a set of metamorphic and metasomatic reactions. The hydrothermal fluid may be magmatic (originate in an intruding magma), circulating groundwater, or ocean water. Convective circulation of hydrothermal fluids in the ocean floor basalts produces extensive hydrothermal metamorphism adjacent to spreading centers and other submarine volcanic areas. The fluids eventually escape through vents on the ocean floor known as black smokers. The patterns of this hydrothermal alteration are used as a guide in the search for deposits of valuable metal ores.\n\n\n=== Shock ===\n\nThis kind of metamorphism occurs when either an extraterrestrial object (a meteorite for instance) collides with the Earth's surface or during an extremely violent volcanic eruption. Impact metamorphism is, therefore, characterized by ultrahigh pressure conditions and low temperature. The resulting minerals (such as SiO2 polymorphs coesite and stishovite) and textures are characteristic of these conditions.\n\n\n=== Dynamic ===\nDynamic metamorphism is associated with zones of high to moderate strain such as fault zones. Cataclasis, crushing and grinding of rocks into angular fragments, occurs in dynamic metamorphic zones, giving cataclastic texture.\nThe textures of dynamic metamorphic zones are dependent on the depth at which they were formed, as the temperature and confining pressure determine the deformation mechanisms which predominate. Within depths less than 5  km, dynamic metamorphism is not often produced because the confining pressure is too low to produce frictional heat. Instead, a zone of breccia or cataclasite is formed, with the rock milled and broken into random fragments. This generally forms a m\u00e9lange. At depth, the angular breccias transit into a ductile shear texture and into mylonite zones.\nWithin the depth range of 5\u201310  km pseudotachylite is formed, as the confining pressure is enough to prevent brecciation and milling and thus energy is focused on discrete fault planes. Frictional heating, in this case, may melt the rock to form pseudotachylite glass.\nWithin the depth range of 10\u201320  km, deformation is governed by ductile deformation conditions and hence frictional heating is dispersed throughout shear zones, resulting in a weaker thermal imprint and distributed deformation. Here, deformation forms mylonite, with dynamothermal metamorphism observed rarely as the growth of porphyroblasts in mylonite zones.\nOverthrusting may juxtapose hot lower crustal rocks against cooler mid and upper crust blocks, resulting in conductive heat transfer and localised contact metamorphism of the cooler blocks adjacent to the hotter blocks, and often retrograde metamorphism in the hotter blocks. The metamorphic assemblages in this case are diagnostic of the depth and temperature and the throw of the fault and can also be dated to give an age of the thrusting.\n\n\n== Classification of metamorphic rocks ==\nMetamorphic rocks are classified by their mineral composition, the source rock, also known as a protolith, and the context (pressure, temperature, hydrological features, etc.) of its formation.\n\n\n=== Metamorphic facies ===\nMetamorphic facies are recognizable terranes or zones with an assemblage of key minerals that were in equilibrium under specific range of temperature and pressure during a metamorphic event. The facies are named after the metamorphic rock formed under those facies conditions from basalt. Facies relationships were first described by Pentti Eskola in 1921.\n\nSee diagram for more detail.\n\n\n=== Metamorphic grades ===\nMetamorphic grade is an informal indication of the amount or degree of metamorphism. A more complete indication of this intensity or degree is provided with the concept of metamorphic facies.\nIn the Barrovian sequence (described by George Barrow in zones of progressive metamorphism in Scotland), metamorphic grades are also classified by mineral assemblage based on the appearance of key minerals in rocks of pelitic (shaly, aluminous) origin:\nLow grade ------------------- Intermediate --------------------- High grade\nGreenschist ------------- Amphibolite ----------------------- Granulite\nSlate --- Phyllite ---------- Schist ---------------------- Gneiss --- Migmatite\nChlorite zone\n\nBiotite zone\n\nGarnet zone\n\nStaurolite zone\n\nKyanite zone\n\nSillimanite zone\n\n\n== Metamorphic processes ==\n\n\n=== Recrystallization ===\nDuring recrystallization, the grains making up the protolith change shape and size. The identity of the mineral does not change during this process, only the texture. Recrystallization occurs due to heating of the protolith. The temperature at which this occurs can vary depending on the minerals present. Recrystallization generally begins when temperatures reach above half the melting point of the mineral on the Kelvin scale.\n\n\n=== Phase change ===\nPhase change metamorphism is the creating of new minerals with the same chemical formula as the protolith. This involves a rearrangement of the atoms in the crystals.\n\n\n=== Neocrystallization ===\nNeocrystallization involves the creation of new mineral crystals different from the protolith. Chemical reactions digest the minerals of the protolith which yields new minerals. This is a very slow process as it can also involve the diffusion of atoms through solid crystals.\n\n\n=== Pressure solution ===\n\nPressure solution is a metamorphic process that requires a rock to be under strong pressure from one direction and in the presence of hot water. During this process mineral of the protolith partially dissolve, diffuse through the water and precipitate elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Plastic deformation ===\nIn plastic deformation pressure is applied to the protolith, which causes it to shear or bend, but not break. In order for this to happen temperatures must be high enough that brittle fractures do not occur, but not so high that diffusion of crystals takes place.\n\n\n== Prograde and retrograde ==\nMetamorphism is further divided into prograde and retrograde metamorphism. Prograde metamorphism involves the change of mineral assemblages (paragenesis) with increasing temperature and (usually) pressure conditions. These are solid state dehydration reactions, and involve the loss of volatiles such as water or carbon dioxide. Prograde metamorphism results in rock characteristic of the maximum pressure and temperature experienced. Metamorphic rocks usually do not undergo further change when they are brought back to the surface.\nRetrograde metamorphism involves the reconstitution of a rock via revolatisation under decreasing temperatures (and usually pressures), allowing the mineral assemblages formed in prograde metamorphism to revert to those more stable at less extreme conditions. This is a relatively uncommon process, because volatiles must be present.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeothermobarometry\nMetamorphic rock\nMetasomatism\nSubduction zone metamorphism\nUltrahigh-temperature metamorphism\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBucher, Kurt, 2002, Petrogenesis of Metamorphic Rock, Springer\nEskola P., 1920, The Mineral Facies of Rocks, Norsk.

Part of the World Music Network Rough Guides series, the release features bhangra, a form of Punjabi music. Disc One highlights artists from the 1980s to 2000s, and Disc Two features the British band Achanak. The album was compiled by DJ Ritu, a British-born musician, BBC Radio 3 host, and co-founder of Outcaste Records. Brad Haynes coordinated the project, Laurence Cedar mastered the work, and Phil Stanton was the producer. The release was preceded by a first edition a decade earlier.\nThe album features artists from India, Pakistan, England, and Scotland.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nWriting for BBC Music, Vibhuti Patel was dismissive of the album and label in general, calling it \"more than a little rough\", and the brand responsible for \"several entry-level collections of world music\" (this being the 202nd release in the series). Patel thought the album should be an historical overview, and lamented the omissions of Gurdas Maan, Malkit Singh, and B21. He also felt Disc Two should have been replaced by another various artist compilation, and wrote that the overall release \"falls short of being a definitive introduction\" (this is in marked contrast with the first edition, which Ted Swedenburg of PopMatters named \"the definitive introduction\").\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== Disc One ===\n\n\n=== Disc Two ===\nAll tracks on Disc Two are performed by Achanak, a seven-piece British band founded in 1989.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nVarious \u2013 The Rough Guide To Bhangra at Discogs",

In the 1960s he gained a degree in modern languages from Leeds University, while playing in student bands. In the mid-1960s he began contributing to the jazz press and was responsible for entries in Jazz on Record: A Critical Guide to the First Fifty Years, 1917\u201367 (1968), edited by Albert McCarthy.\nIn 1969 Priestley moved to London and began playing piano with bands led by Tony Faulkner and Alan Cohen. Priestley helped transcribe Duke Ellington's Black, Brown and Beige and Creole Rhapsody for Cohen, and formed his own Special Septet featuring Digby Fairweather and Don Rendell. His compositions include Blooz For Dook (published in his 1986 book Jazz Piano 4), The Whole Thing (recorded by the National Youth Jazz Orchestra in 1997) and Jamming With Jools (a 1998 examination piece for the Associated Board of Royal Schools of Music, based on a live broadcast with Jools Holland).\nHe is also known for broadcasting work on the BBC as well as London Jazz FM, and his weekly series for BBC Radio London influenced the renewed interest in jazz in the 1980s. Priestley taught jazz piano at Goldsmiths College from 1977 until 1993, and has taught jazz history for various other universities and conservatoires over the years. Priestley has also written biographies of Charles Mingus, John Coltrane and Charlie Parker, as well as the book Jazz on Record: A History. He co-authored The Rough Guide to Jazz, as well as contributing to several other reference books, and has compiled and/or annotated more than a hundred reissue compilations.\nSince 2006 Priestley has lived in Tralee, Ireland, where he continues playing the piano and presents a show on Radio Kerry.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLove You Gladly (1988; Cadillac)\nYou Taught My Heart to Sing (1994; w/Don Rendell; Spirit of Jazz)\nLove You Madly (1999; Louise Gibbs/Brian Priestley/Tony Coe; 33 Jazz)\nWho Knows (2004; 33 Jazz)\n\n\n== Literature ==\nPriestley.

            "content": "Haughley railway station was located in Haughley, Suffolk on the Great Eastern Main Line between Liverpool Street Station and Norwich. It opened on 7 July 1849 named Haughley Junction and was a replacement for a station named Haughley Road which had been in service from 1846 to 1849 at location TM 02981 63319 on the line to Elmswell.\nHaughley railway station also served two other lines, the line to Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge and Ely and the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway. Originally the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway's operation was confined to an adjacent but separate terminus but it was closed in 1925 when all services were diverted to the main line station .\nHaughley closed with effect from 2 January 1967 as part of the Beeching Axe and most of the station building was demolished as well as the three platforms and the two signalboxes, the turntable filled in and the sidings removed. By 2016 only the stationmaster's house remains.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Opening (1849-1862) ===\nThe first line to Haughley was built by the Ipswich and Bury Railway (which later became part of the Eastern Union Railway(EUR), opening to passengers Bury St Edmunds and Ipswich on 9 December 1846. This line served the original Haughley Road station which opened on 7 December 1846 although passenger services did not commence until 24 December 1846 following late receipt of the Board of Trade operating certificate..\nWith the opening of the EUR line towards Norwich (initially as far as Burston) on 2 July 1849 a new station called Haughley was opened (with Haughley Road closing a week later) just east of the junction so it could be served by trains on both routes. Before the line from Bury to Cambridge was opened the line was largely worked as a branch with passenger trains using a bay platform at the station.\nIn 1854 the EUR was taken over by the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) who became responsible for the operation of the station. However, by the 1860s the railways in East Anglia were in financial trouble, and most were leased to the ECR; they wished to amalgamate formally, but could not obtain government agreement for this until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway was formed by amalgamation. Haughley thus became a GER station in 1862.\n\n\n=== Great Eastern Railway (1862-1922) ===\nIn 1866 the station was renamed Haughley Road by the GER and it was about this time that the station buildings were constructed . Having spent this money it is also worth noting that the GER board considered closure as receipts were low (the village of 828 souls being located \u00be miles from the village meant receipts were never going to be high).\nOn 28 December 1874 there was an accident at Haughley Road (as the station was then named).\nIn 1890 the stations name was once again changed to Haughley. Two years later on 7 September 1892 there was another accident at the station when a train derailed.\nIn 1904 the Mid Suffolk Light Railway (MSLR) opened as an independently run line to Laxfield. Opening to light goods (the line served a predominantly agricultural area) it was felt there was enough potential for passenger traffic, which commenced on 29 September 1908. This used a separate single-platformed terminus station to the east of the main line station..\nOn 1 January 1923 the GER amalgamated with several other railways to create the London & North Eastern Railway.\n\n\n=== LNER (1923-1947) ===\nThe MSLR did not become part of the LNER at the grouping as the LNER was reluctant to take over the light railway\u2019s debts. A deal was done and in 1924 the MSLR became part of the LNER and soon after the LNER named the main line station Haughley East and the MSLR terminus Haughley West.\nIn 1929 the Travelling Post Office service that had terminated at Ipswich was extended to Norwich with a stop at Haughley, A second TPO service ran from Kings Lynn via March and Ely to connect at Haughley. By 1948 this service ran to and from Peterborough East. All this activity took place in the early hours of the morning.\nIn 1932 LNER renamed the combined station Haughley.\nIn 1939 the former MSLR terminus station was converted to a petrol depot (serving this role until 1944) and trains from the Mid-Suffolk line were routed to a bay platform at the main Haughley station.\nAfter World War 2 a rail served grain dryer was built at Haughley.\n\n\n=== British Railways (1948-1967) ===\nThe nationalisation of Britain's railways saw the operation of Haughley station pass to British Railways Eastern Region. The loss making Mid-Suffolk line was closed on 26 July 1952.\nThe bay platform was closed in 1960 and the track lifted the same year. The turntable was also removed c1960 and the pit filled in and adjacent sidings removed.\nThe goods yard was closed on 28 December 1964 and the MSLR sidings were lifted c1965.\nThe Ipswich to Norwich stopping service was withdrawn on 5 November 1966 leaving the station served by the stopping Ipswich - Cambridge service. The parcels service was also withdrawn on this date.\nHaughley closed with effect from 2 January 1967 as part of the Beeching Axe and most of the station building was demolished as well as the three platforms.\n\n\n=== After closure ===\nOn the evening of 13 March 1971, D1562 (a Class 47 locomotive with an experimentally uprated power plant) hauled the 19:30 Liverpool Street to Norwich train. Near Haughley Junction an explosion occurred in the engine room, followed by a fire. The force of the explosion blew the engine room door off its' hinges striking driver Harry Hendry; and breaking his arm. \nOn 16 May 1971 Haughley Junction was re-laid as single lead junction.\nOn 22nd June 1982 another accident happened at Haughley Junction. During the early hours when the 01:01 Ipswich to Peterborough train [hauled by a class 31 locomotive] was alleged (at the time) to have over-run the signal protecting the junction at Haughley and struck the 23.20 Peterborough - Ipswich Postal service. Some photographs of the aftermath can be found here:https://www.flickr.com/photos/alan1960/5576025693/\nThe line to Norwich was electrified in 1985 with electric services commencing the following year.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe station was situated 82 miles and 75 chains from London Liverpool Street and consisted of an up platform (420 feet) with a bay platform and a down island platform (430 feet). These were linked by a footbridge (the original wooden one being replaced by a metal one in 1910).\nIt is possible that like Finningham to the north, the cash strapped Eastern Union Railway took the view in 1849 that better facilities would follow should the station prove popular as the original structure (designed by Frederick Barnes who designed a number of the local railway stations) was replaced by the GER between 1864 and 1866.\nThe new facilities included an ornate entrance, booking and parcels offices, waiting room, ladies waiting room, gentlemen\u2019s toilets, a porters room and a station house. The station was part covered by a 240 foot awning.\nA waiting room on the down island platform was provided in 1887 which also had a gentlemen\u2019s urinal.\nInitially a goods shed and 42 foot diameter turntable were provided at Haughley, located on the down side. On the up side, a number of sidings existed east of the station facilitating the exchange of traffic between the MSLR and the GER.\nBy 2014 only the stationmaster's house remains.\n\n\n== Signal Boxes ==\nAccording to GER minutes signals were first approved for the Haughley area in March 1875. By 1893 two signal boxes were controlling the Haughley area. Below is an overview of the area\u2019s signalling history. \u2003\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHaughley station on 1946 O. S. map",

            "content": "Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football program represents Middle Tennessee State University in the sport of American football. The Blue Raiders compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the East Division of Conference USA (CUSA). They are coached by Rick Stockstill, who started in 2006. Middle Tennessee has appeared in ten bowl games and seven I-AA playoffs. The Blue Raiders play their home games at the Johnny \"Red\" Floyd Stadium which has a seating capacity of 30,788.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history (1911\u20131946) ===\nMiddle Tennessee State University first fielded a football team in 1911 under the direction of head coach L. T. \"Mutt\" Weber. From 1913\u20131923, Alfred B. Miles led the Blue Raiders football program. The 1914 football season led by Miles was its first undefeated season, with five straight victories after a tie with Cumberland.\nFrank Faulkinberry was hired as MTSU's head coach after Miles' departure. During his tenure, the Blue Raiders compiled a record of 33\u201326\u20134. Faulkinberry was found shot to death in his garage on May 13, 1933, a suspected suicide being the cause.\nE. M. Waller led the Blue Raiders for two seasons and compiled a 3\u201314\u20131 record. Waller resigned due to the team's struggles after two seasons.\nJohnny Floyd returned to MTSU in 1935 and led the Blue Raiders for four seasons. Under his tutelage, the Blue Raiders compiled a record of 30\u20138\u20131. Floyd's 1935 team went a perfect 8\u20130. However, a 2\u20136 campaign in 1938 ended his time in Murfreesboro.\nErnest Alley was named the next head coach of MTSU football, and in his one-season, the Blue Raiders compiled a 1\u20136\u20131 record.\nE. W. Midgett led the Blue Raiders for four seasons (MTSU did not field a football team from 1943\u20131945 because of World War II. In 1940, Midgett led the Blue Raiders to a 4\u20134 mark. In 1941, the Blue Raiders posted a 4\u20133\u20131 campaign, followed by 4\u20132\u20131 in 1942, and 6\u20132\u20131 in 1946.\n\n\n=== Charles Murphy era (1947\u20131968) ===\nCharles Murphy is the longest-tenured and winningest head coach in MTSU, football history, with a 155\u201363\u20138 record in 22 seasons as MTSU's head coach. Under Murphy's tutelage, the Blue Raiders posted four undefeated seasons (1949, 1957, 1959 and 1965) along with 17 winning seasons and three bowl appearances. Murphy was asked to resign at MTSU after a 2\u20138 campaign in 1968.\n\n\n=== Donald Fuoss era (1969) ===\nSucceeding Murphy as the Blue Raiders head coach was Donald Fuoss, who only lasted for one season, a 1\u20139 campaign in 1969 that resulted in his firing.\n\n\n=== Bill Peck era (1970\u20131974) ===\nCoach Bill Peck took over in 1970 and instantly brought improvement to Murfreesboro. In his first season, the Blue Raiders posted a 6\u20133\u20131 record. In 1971, MTSU posted a record of 7\u20134. That was followed by a 7\u20133\u20131 mark in 1972, a 4\u20137 mark in 1973 and a 3\u20138 campaign in 1974. Peck was asked to resign after back to back losing seasons to end his tenure.\n\n\n=== Ben Hurt era (1975\u20131978) ===\nBen Hurt took over the Blue Raiders in 1975. Under his tutelage, in 1975, MTSU posted a 4\u20137 mark. That was followed by another 4\u20137 campaign in 1976. In 1977, Hurt's Blue Raiders posted a 3\u20138 record that was followed by a 1\u20139\u20131 1978 season, after which Hurt was fired.\n\n\n=== James Donnelly era (1979\u20131998) ===\nAustin Peay head coach James Donnelly was hired as MTSU's head coach in 1979. Under his leadership, the MTSU football program compiled a record of 133\u201380\u20131. Donnelly is the second winningest football coach in MTSU history. Of his 20 seasons at the helm, 15 of them were winning seasons (including 12 in a row) and four of them were seasons of at least 10 wins. Donnelly resigned after a 5\u20135 season in 1998.\n\n\n=== Andy McCollum era (1999\u20132005) ===\nBaylor assistant coach Andy McCollum took over for Donnelly in 1999. McCollum led the Blue Raiders to a 6\u20135 record in 2000, their first as an FBS program. In 2001, MTSU finished 8\u20133, won the Sun Belt Conference championship and oversaw an offense that ranked fifth nationally. In 2005, MTSU's defense ranked ninth nationally. McCollum was fired after the 2005 season.\n\n\n=== Rick Stockstill era (2006\u2013present) ===\n\nIn 2006, South Carolina tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator Rick Stockstill got the head coaching job at Middle Tennessee State. In his first season, Stockstill led the Blue Raiders to the program's second bowl game as well as a share of the Sun Belt Conference title. He was later that year named the conference coach of the year.\nThe 2007 and 2008 seasons saw the Blue Raiders take a small step back with back-to-back 5\u20137 seasons. However, in 2009, Stockstill and the Blue Raiders went 10\u20133 and won the New Orleans Bowl, which was the second bowl victory in school history. Again, Stockstill was named conference coach of the year for the 2009 season. The Blue Raiders went to another bowl in 2010, and they finished the season 6\u20137 after losing the GoDaddy.com Bowl.\nAfter the successful 2009 season, he turned down several offers from other schools, including Conference USA's East Carolina and Memphis, citing that it was not the right time to leave the Blue Raiders. Stockstill has led MTSU to five bowl games in 11 years.\nIn 2016, Stockstill led the Blue Raiders to a 8\u20135, 5\u20133 in C-USA play to finish in third place in the East Division. They were invited to the Hawaii Bowl where they lost to Hawaii.\n\n\n== Rivalries ==\n\n\n=== Troy Trojans ===\n\nMiddle Tennessee's rivalry with Troy, now dormant following Middle Tennessee's 2013 move to Conference USA, is known as the Battle for the Palladium. Troy and Middle Tennessee first played each other in 1936, but it wasn't until 2003 that schools started playing annually for the Palladium Trophy. Middle Tennessee currently leads the series 12-8.\n\n\n=== Western Kentucky Hilltoppers ===\n\nThe rivalry between Middle Tennessee and Western Kentucky, is both school's oldest rivalry, as the two programs played together for several decades in the Ohio Valley Conference before both became members of the Sun Belt Conference and then transitioned to Conference USA about the same time. The name comes from the fact that the two universities are separated by about 100 miles.\n\n\n== Nickname ==\nThe nickname of the Middle Tennessee athletic teams is the Blue Raiders. Female teams were long known as the Lady Raiders, but adopted the Blue Raiders name in 2007. The nickname's origin goes back to a 1934 newspaper contest. An MT football player, Charles Sarver, won $5 from Murfreesboro's The Daily News Journal with his winning entry \"Blue Raiders\", which he later admitted borrowing from Colgate University, whose teams were known as \"Raiders\" at the time. No official nickname existed prior to 1934, when teams were called \"Normalites\", \"Teachers\", and \"Pedagogues\".\n\n\n== Colors and mascot ==\nMT is represented by the colors white and royal blue, described as PMS 301 by the university.\nLightning is the mascot of both the Middle Tennessee men and women's sports teams.\n\n\n== Conference championships ==\nMiddle Tennessee has won 12 conference championships, seven outright and five shared. \n\u2020 denotes co-championship\n\n\n== Bowl games ==\nMiddle Tennessee has appeared in eleven bowl games as a program, with four of those falling as a non-Division I Bowl game. The Blue Raiders have a record of 4\u20137. MT appeared twice in the Tangerine Bowl (now the Citrus Bowl). The first game, played January 1, 1960, against Presbyterian College, resulted in a 21\u201312 win. The second game, against Lamar University on December 29, 1961, was a 21\u201314 loss.\nThe Blue Raiders were invited to the Motor City Bowl in 2006 after a shared conference title with Troy University. Troy had won the conference with a tie-breaker, but MT was invited due to the Big Ten having two teams in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) and thus being unable to fulfill their bowl contract for the Motor City Bowl. This was their first bowl game in 42 years along with their first under Division I. They played Central Michigan University in the game and were defeated 31\u201314.\nMT finished the 2009 regular season with a 9\u20133 record and was invited to play in the R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl on December 20, 2009. The team played against the University of Southern Mississippi, defeating them 42\u201332. This was their second bowl game since joining the FBS and first ever bowl win. Quarterback Dwight Dasher was named as the game's MVP after rushing and passing for two touchdowns each.\nnon-Division I bowl game\n\n\n== Division I-AA Playoffs results ==\nThe Blue Raiders have appeared in the I-AA playoffs seven times with a record of 6\u20137.\n\n\n== Retired number ==\nMiddle Tennessee has retired one jersey number. Morris was in the forefront of a big era of the Eagles, winning three OVC championships in his tenure as quarterback.\n\n\n== All-time record vs. CUSA teams ==\nOfficial record (including any NCAA imposed vacates and forfeits) against all current CUSA opponents:\n\n\n== Future non-conference opponents ==\nAnnounced schedules as of December 24, 2016.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "The name T\u00e2y S\u01a1n (Vietnamese: [t\u0259j \u0282\u0259\u02d0n]) is used in Vietnamese history in various ways to refer to the period of peasant rebellions and decentralized dynasties established between the end of the figurehead L\u00ea dynasty in 1770 and the beginning of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty in 1802. The name of the rebel leaders' home district, T\u00e2y S\u01a1n, came to be applied to the leaders themselves (the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers: i.e., Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c, Hu\u1ec7, and L\u1eef), their uprising (the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Uprising) or their rule (the [Nguy\u1ec5n] T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty).\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring the 18th century, Annam was under the nominal rule of the officially revered, but politically powerless L\u00ea dynasty. Real power was in the hands of two warring feudal families, the Tr\u1ecbnh lords of the north who controlled and ruled from the imperial court in Hanoi and the Nguy\u1ec5n lords in the south, who ruled from their capital Hu\u1ebf. Both sides fought each other for control of the country, while claiming to be loyal to the emperor. Life for the peasant farmers was difficult. Ownership of land became more concentrated in the hands of a few landlords as time passed. The Mandarin bureaucracy was oppressive and often corrupt; at one point, royal-sanctioned degrees were up for sale for whoever was wealthy enough to purchase them. In contrast to the people, the ruling lords lived lavish lifestyles in huge palaces. The decades-long war between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n had ended in 1673, and life for the northern peasants was fairly peaceful. However, the Nguy\u1ec5n Lords engaged in a regular series of wars with the weak Khmer Empire, and later, the fairly strong state of Siam. While the Nguy\u1ec5n usually won, and despite the fact that the new lands they conquered offered new opportunities for the landless poor, the frequent wars took a toll on their popularity.\n\n\n== Conquest of Nguy\u1ec5n clan ==\nIn 1769, the new king of Siam, King Taksin, launched a war to regain control of Cambodia. The war generally went against Nguy\u1ec5n lords and they were forced to abandon some of the newly conquered lands, which included Cambodia's Eastern Coast (Cochin China). This failure, coupled with heavy taxes and corruption at the local level, caused three brothers from the village of T\u00e2y S\u01a1n to begin a revolt against Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1ea7n.\nThe T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers styled themselves as champions of the people. Over the next year, the revolt gained traction and they won some battles against the Nguy\u1ec5n army units sent to crush their rebellion. The T\u00e2y S\u01a1n had a great deal of popular support, not only from the poor farmers, but from some of the indigenous highland tribes. The leader of the three brothers, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7, was also a very skilled military leader. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 said that his goal was to end the people's oppression, reunite the country, and restore the power of the L\u00ea emperor in Hanoi. The T\u00e2y S\u01a1n also promised to remove corrupt officials and redistribute land.\nIn 1773 the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n captured the port of Qui Nh\u01a1n, where the merchants, who had suffered under restrictive laws put in place by the Nguy\u1ec5n, gave the uprising financial support. The Nguy\u1ec5n, at last recognizing the serious scale of the revolt, made peace with the Siamese, giving up some land they had conquered in previous decades. However, their problems were compounded when Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m chose to end the 100-year peace and exploit the turmoil in the south by sending his army to attack Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n (modern day Hu\u1ebf), the Nguy\u1ec5n capital. The Tr\u1ecbnh army captured the city, forcing the Nguy\u1ec5n to flee to Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh (later called Saigon).\nThe Tr\u1ecbnh army continued to head south and the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army continued its conquest of other southern cities. The Nguy\u1ec5n were unpopular at this time, and the forces against them were too powerful. In 1776, the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army captured the last Nguy\u1ec5n stronghold of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh and massacred the town's Han Chinese population. The entire Nguy\u1ec5n family was killed at the end of the siege, except for one nephew, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh, who managed to escape to Siam. T\u00e2y S\u01a1n eldest brothers, Nguy\u1ec5n Nh\u1ea1c, proclaimed himself Emperor in 1778. A conflict with the Tr\u1ecbnh was thus unavoidable.\n\n\n== Defeat of Siam ==\nThe T\u00e2y S\u01a1n spent the next decade consolidating their control over the former Nguy\u1ec5n territory. Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh proved to be a stubborn enemy. He convinced the King of Siam, P'ya Taksin, to invade Vietnam in support of him. The Siamese army attacked in 1780, but in several years of warfare, it was unable to defeat the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army, as gains were followed by losses. In 1782, the Siamese king was killed in a revolt, and less than a year later, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh's forces were driven out of Vietnam. In 1785, Siam launched an invasion again and occupied part of Cuu Long Delta, but was defeated by Nguyen Hue in the Battle of R\u1ea1ch G\u1ea7m-Xo\u00e0i M\u00fat.\n\n\n== Conquest of Tr\u1ecbnh clan ==\nHaving vanquished the Nguy\u1ec5n for the time being, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 decided to destroy the power of the Tr\u1ecbnh clan . He marched to the north at the head of a large army in 1786, and after a short campaign, defeated the Tr\u1ecbnh army successfully. The Tr\u1ecbnh were also unpopular and the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army seemed invincible. The Tr\u1ecbnh clan fled north into China. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 later married princess L\u00ea Ng\u1ecdc H\u00e2n, the daughter of the nominal later L\u00ea Emperor, L\u00ea Hi\u1ec3n T\u00f4ng.\n\n\n== Defeat of Qing Empire ==\nA few months later, realising that his hope of retaining power had gone, the Emperor L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng fled north to the Qing Empire of China, where he formally petitioned the Qianlong Emperor for aid. The Qianlong Emperor agreed to restore L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng to power, and so in 1788, a large Qing army marched south into Vietnam and captured the capital Th\u0103ng Long.\nNguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 gathered a new army and prepared to fight the Qing army. He addressed his troops before the battle saying:\n\nThe Qing have invaded our country and occupied the capital city, Th\u0103ng Long. In our history, the Tr\u01b0ng Sisters fought against the Han, \u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng against the Song, Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o against the Mongol Yuan, and L\u00ea L\u1ee3i against the Ming. These heroes did not resign themselves to standing by and seeing the invaders plunder our country; they inspired the people to fight for a just cause and drive out the aggressors... The Qing, forgetting what happened to the Song, Yuan and Ming, have invaded our country. We are going to drive them out of our territory.\n\nIn a surprise attack, while the Qing army was celebrating the Lunar New Year, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's army defeated them at the Battle of Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ed3i-\u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a and forced them, along with L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng, to flee back to China.\nThe Tay Son were supported by Chinese pirates. Anti-pirate activities were undertaken by a joint alliance between Qing China and Nguy\u1ec5n lords Gia Long while Chinese pirates collaborated with the Tay Son.\n\n\n== Decline and fall ==\nAfter Emperor Quang Trung's death, his son Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n was enthroned as Emperor C\u1ea3nh Th\u1ecbnh at the age of ten. However, the real power was in the hands of his uncle Bui Dac Tuyen, who enacted a massive political purge. Many who served under Quang Trung were executed, while others became discouraged and left the regime, considerably weakening the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n. This paved the way for Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh to capture the entire country within 10 years, with the help of French military adventurers enlisted by French bishop Pigneau de Behaine. In 1800, Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh occupied Quy Nh\u01a1n citadel. In 1801, he occupied Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n, forcing Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n to flee to Th\u0103ng Long. In 1802, Anh besieged Th\u0103ng Long. The then 20-year-old Nguy\u1ec5n Quang To\u1ea3n escaped, but then was captured and executed, ending the dynasty after 24 years, and the Nguy\u1ec5n, the last imperial dynasty of Vietnam, took over the country in 1802.\nThe Nguyen used crushing by elephant to execute the defeated Tay Son leader B\u00f9i Th\u1ecb Xu\u00e2n. The heart and liver from her body were consumed by soldiers of the Nguyen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTen Great Campaigns\n\n\n== References ==\n\nGeorge Edson Dutton: The Tay Son Uprising: Society and Rebellion in Eighteenth-Century Vietnam.
