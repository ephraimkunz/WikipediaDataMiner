(\u5ddd\u5d0e\u6c7d\u8239\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, Kawasaki Kisen Kabushiki-gaisha), also referred to as \"K\" Line, is one of the largest Japanese transportation companies. It owns a fleet that includes dry cargo ships (bulk carriers), container ships, liquefied natural gas carriers, Ro-Ro ships, tankers and container terminals.\nIt is the fourteenth largest container transportation and shipping company in the world.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1919-1944 ===\n\n\"K\" Line (named after three K initials) was formed when Kojiro Matsukata placed Kawasaki Kisen, Kawasaki Zosen and Kokusai Kisen under joint management to build a stronger fleet of 40 to 50 ships serving the Atlantic, North and South America, Africa and the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. According to Lloyds, the newly established \"K\" Line was ranked 13th in the world in 1926, behind NYK (9th) but ahead of O.S.K. (14th).\nBy the end of World War II, Kawasaki Kisen had lost 56 vessels; 12 survived.\n\n\n=== 1945-1961 ===\nDuring that vital recovery period, \"K\" Line steadily returned to the building and operation of ships, reestablished bases of operation around the world, increased earnings and took other steps to restore corporate strength and vibrancy.\n\n\n=== 1962-1967 ===\nAfter the merger with Iino Kisen, \"K\" Line was newly capitalized at \u00a59 billion and controlled a fleet of 104 ships, 55 of which were also owned by \"K\" Line. The merger gave \"K\" Line a solid foundation to advance dynamically into the future both as one of the world's largest shipping lines in terms of fleet size and as a well-balanced, integrated organization.\n\n\n=== 1971 ===\nK Line opens International Transportation Service, a container terminal company in the Port of Long Beach.\n\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\nK Line Offshore AS was founded in Arendal, Norway in October 2007 as a subsidiary of K Line to provide offshore support services to oil and gas fields. They have commissioned new ships suitable for oil and gas fields in ultra-deep water, harsh environments and/or remote areas. They operate the following ships:\nKL Arendalfjord - Delivered 24 October 2008\nKL Brevikfjord - Delivered 24 September 2010\nKL Sandefjord - Delivered 7 January 2011\nKL Brisfjord - Delivered 13 January 2011\nKL Brofjord - Delivered 5 April 2011\nKL Saltfjord - Delivered 14 April 2011\nKL Barentsfjord - Delivered 28 June 2011\n\n\n=== 2016 ===\nOn Monday 31 October 2016, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha - K Line, Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) agreed to merge their container shipping business via establishing a completely new joint venture company. The integration will also include their overseas terminal activities. The new Company shall start operations from April 2018.\n\n\n=== 2017 ===\nThe new joint venture company will operate under the name \u201cOcean Network Express\u201d. Holding company office in Tokyo, global headquarter in Singapore and regional headquarters in United Kingdom (London), United States (Richmond, VA), Hong Kong, and Brazil (S\u00e3o Paulo). The service starting date for Ocean Network Express is fixed for April 1, 2018.\n\n\n== 10 Ships to be manned by Filipinos ==\n\nOn September 30, 2007, Shuichiro Maeda, K-Line president, said the company will build 10 cargo ships to be manned by an all-Filipino officers and crew. The vessels are expected to be finished by 2010. It will employ 7,000 Filipinos in the next 4 years (3,330 officers and 3,600 ratings or crew). K-Line will build the K-Line Maritime Academy-Philippines operational in February 2008 and is intended to train at least 10,000 seafarers a year.\n\n\n== Others ==\n\"K\" Line Air Service, Ltd. changed name into \"K\" Line Logistics, Ltd.\n\"K\" Line Travel, Ltd.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Ltd.\n\"K\" Line America\n\"K\" Line (Singapore) Pte Ltd.\nK Line Offshore AS",

            "content": "Jinhua Homestay Project is a cultural exchange and homestay program organized by the Jinhua Municipal People\u2019s Government Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Office. It is a Home+ project initiated to promote tourism in the villages of China by using idle village resources. The project invites overseas students to stay for a period of 3 weeks and experience the authentic Chinese culture in one of the villages of Jinhua. So far, the sessions were held in Siping, Suoyuan and Yuyuan. During their stay the participants experience and perform various activities which enable them to learn more about traditional Chinese culture, local customs and folklores. The project conducts two sessions per year and every session is in a different village. The cost incurred during the project is entirely paid by the project management authorities. The participants will stay with a Chinese family and experience the traditional Chinese lifestyle. The participants have to perform a number of tasks during their stay with the purpose to provide for ideas and suggestions to preserve, protect and promote the ancient Chinese villages. The four sessions to date have attracted 163 overseas participants from 27 countries. They made village maps, studied ancient architecture, learned local folk culture and interviewed villagers to discover ancient stories, contributing to the protection and development of the ancient villages.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis project is the first of its kind nationally, and it is aimed at protecting the ancient village life. It was realized that while communicating with the outside world language wasn\u2019t the major barrier but the lack of understanding and ignorance about the Chinese culture and tradition was the reason that others were not able to understand the Chinese people and connect with them. Thus not language barrier but to break the cultural barrier this program was initiated by the Jinhua Municipal People\u2019s government foreign and overseas Chinese affairs office. Due to urbanization many people from these villages travelled to the bigger cities and the government too did not have adequate funds to provide for 195 of these villages and fund the bigger cities as well. So while bigger cities were gaining popularity the village condition was degrading, thus the Government thought that tourism can help uplift these villages and through this program let the world know about the culture, traditions and people of these villages. The team who put together this project and has been running it for 3 years now, is the Jinhua Municipal People\u2019s government foreign and overseas Chinese affairs office. The project is now conducting its 5th session, being held at Suoyuan village.\n\n\n== Villages ==\nShangjing Village is located in the west of Jinhua, Zhejiang, 30 km away from Jinhua Downtown area and 2.5 km away from the town of Tangxi, It is close to Yuexi Brook to the East,adjacent to Houdayuan on the South and near the Jiufeng mountain to the West. The village was formerly known as Fenglinzhuang (or Maple Forest Village) and changed to the current name due to its \"wind and water favorable\" location. Since 1048 when Liu Qing, the first ancestor of Liu clan, brought his family in this village and settled down, the Liu clan has been living here for 36 generations. Shangjing is laid out generally like a boat setting sail, implying that \"the boat sets off smoothly for a long and good journey\". The Village is surrounded by two brooks, called Dongzhen and Xizhen, respectively and dotted with ancient alleys, houses, halls, and wells here and there. To date, Shainging still preserves more than 50 ancient houses and 20 grand halls that can be dated back to Ming and Qing Dynasties. Among them, is the provincially unique five-room ancestral hall, known as Lui Clan Ancestral Hall and other six architectural sites, that is Baishun Hall, Liuji Hall, Qianji Hall, Xizhen Lane # 48 Folk House (i.e. Upstairs Hall).The Trail Gate Tower, Dragon Eye Well and Lui Clan Ancestral Grave were named the \" Provincial Cultural Relics Protection Units\" in January 2017.\n\n\n== Siping Village ==\nThis Village is located in Town, in the Wucheng District of Jinhua City, Siping Village boasts a long history of about 700 years. Its well-protected ancient architecture was built in the Hui style, and its delicate brick arts and crafts have attracted the attention of thousands of experts, scholars and tourists. Moreover, Siping has the most charming brick-carving houses and was the Hometown of Yinning, one of the ten great beauties of ancient China. Because Siping was built with the saying \"Seven stars around the moon\" in mind, there are a number of ancient halls in the Village.\n\n\n== Suoyuan ==\nvillage is located 15 km north of Lipu Town, in Jingdong district, Jinhua and 10 km from downtown/urban area, Jinhua. Its name is derived from the shape of the village as it resembles an ancient longevity lock, thus the literal English translation of the name is Jade Garden. Most residents carry the surname \u201cYan\u201d, as they are descendants of Yan- Zi-Ling, a famous hermit of Eastern Han Dynasty. This village has a history of over 480 years and the same is reflected by the ancient halls namely Wuben hall, Yan ancestral hall, liagmian halls, Jishu hall, zhongshu hall, huaide hall, Jiyi hall, henghui hall and yongsi hall which are highlights of the village to serve as major tourist attractions. While many of these halls have a history of over 200 years modern buildings can be seen in the village. Though the village is a little far from the city it has all the facilities like a bakery shop, Coffee shop, a small clinic, and two convenience stores to comfort the travelers. There is also a museum at the north end of the village. Many young people have left the village to work in cities, a common phenomenon in China today. Therefore, the population consists mainly of older people. However, because Suoyuan is relatively close to Jinhua city, the age profile is more mixed than in similar villages in more remote locations. It is one of the oldest villages in Jinhua. Its traditional buildings, built of stone or wood, retain many fine and very lifelike carvings of animals, birds, flowers and landscapes. The very first session of this program was held in the year 2014 in Suoyuan village.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n== Pottery ==\nChinese pottery, also called Chinese ceramics are objects made of clay and hardened by heat: earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain. Nowhere in the world has pottery assumed such importance as in China. This project arranges a trip to Just Fire, Guwuyaohuo, which is the most famous pottery factory in Jinhua City, China. Before visiting the factory the participants are given a lecture on pottery in China generally and about the factory specifically. This lecture is given by Mr. Fang Yi who is the founder of the Just Fire pottery factory. Detailed information is communicated during this lecture at the salon in the respective village where the session is organized. The purpose behind conducting this lecture is to educate the participants so that during their visit to the factory all participants are aware and have a clear understanding of the art of pottery and the factory. During their visit the participants will visit a museum, within the factory, displaying beautiful pottery and getting to know the ancient and modern forms of pottery. Further the students will practically experience pottery making, where this activity is of two types 1) making of pottery by use of a machine 2) making of pottery by use of only clay and rolling pin. The participants will get a chance to experience both of these types.\n\n\n== Folklore ==\nOne of the major features of this program is the hosting of a number of folklore activities. These activities include tea making, paper cutting, shoe-weaving, flower arrangement, grinding tofu, calligraphy, wu opera, niangao making and many more. The villagers themselves will conduct all these activities so as to make the participants experience the Chinese culture in its most authentic form. Moreover, the techniques and tools used for conducting these activities are also ancient and so the participants will get an understanding as to how Chinese people in past conducted their lifestyle. These activities are conducted in the ancient halls which are built in the village and with the help of a volunteer interpreter the participants can also know about the history of any particular folklore.\n\n\n== Calligraphy ==\nThe practice of calligraphy runs deep in the Chinese culture and is deemed important in their art scene. This project gives the participants and opportunity to know and learn calligraphy from the most famous professor Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu will firstly give a lecture on the history and evolution of the practice of calligraphy and later teach the participants himself how calligraphy is to be performed. It is said that the beauty of calligraphy lies in the precision and meaning of the strokes and so a lecture and a practice of the same gives the participants great understanding about this Chinese art.\n\n\n== Wu Opera ==\nWu Opera, also known as Jinhua Opera, is one of the oldest operas (has a 400-year history) in China. The earliest days of Wu opera can be traced back to Ming Dynasty(AD1386-AD1683). The name originated from Wuzhou, the former name of Jinhua. It's characterized with loud and sonorous singing, ardent and bold manners, and surprisingly special martial arts. During this project Wu opera performances are conducted by the students of Jinhua art school and later the participants are taken to China Wu Opera Theatre to experience professional Wu opera performances. Wu opera artists wear bold and bright makeup so that the expressions and meaning of the song can be dramatically be put forth. Similarly their costumes too are very dramatic consisting of feathers, huge headgears, long robes etc. the participants will get a chance to wear their costumes and makeups and also to know about the history of this form of expression.\n\n\n== Dragon Dance ==\nThe dragons hold a very significant position in the Chinese tradition. They are supposed to bring good luck as they possess power, dignity and wisdom. Thus, the Chinese love to perform the Dragon dance during the Chinese New Year. Tourists from around the globe come to china to see this dance style A huge dragon is made out of wood, with poles places at equal intervals to hold the dragon and it was decorated with beautiful lanterns and flowers. Chinese believe that longer the dragon, more good luck it is supposed to bring to the people. The participants can themselves carry the dragon along with the villagers and perform the dragon dance.\n\n\n== Wood Painting ==\nLet it be grinding of tofu or making of tea, Chinese have their own unique way to do it and so similarly they have a unique way of making beautiful paintings. While strolling around in Suoyuan village you might come across a hall with beautiful paintings, the unique aspect about these paintings is that they are made with the help of wood. First they carve the painting they want to make on a piece of wood, such wood being soft in material, then they paint the wood with the choice of colours they would want to use and then use this piece of wood as a stamp on a sheet of paper. However the painting contains of only 5 colours and there is a separate piece of wood for every individual color. The participants are given a chance to experience this unique way of painting at Jinhua New Year\u2019s Painting Museum Where you can make your own painting and take it with you as a memory of one of the many things China has to offer. The participants can also design their own T-shirts using the same technique. Out of the many activities this program has to offer woodpainting is one of the unique and fun activity which the participants enjoy lot.\n\n\n== Wu Jing Boxing ==\nChinese Martial Arts are the most traditional martial arts in the world as they existed prior to the 12th century. Chinese Martial Arts include hundreds of different styles and it is undoubtedly the most versatile martial art in the world. Specifically, we learned Wu Jing Boxing from our master. Wu Jing Boxing, which is about 200 years old, is a combination of inside and outside boxing. Every gesture and motion is strong, vicious, flexible, and fairly easy for people to attack and defend. However, the biggest emphasis is to use it to defend This program organizes martial art training by Mr. Wang Shenjiang who has 57 years of experience in Wu Jing Boxing and he was also a school teacher for many years. The moves and tactics which are learnt throughout the session are then performed by the participants during the closing ceremony.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The Oklahoma City National Memorial is a memorial in the United States that honors the victims, survivors, rescuers, and all who were affected by the Oklahoma City bombing on April 19, 1995. The memorial is located in downtown Oklahoma City on the former site of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, which was damaged in the 1995 bombing. This building was located on NW 5th Street between N. Robinson Avenue and N. Harvey Avenue.\nThe National Memorial was authorized on October 9, 1997, by President Bill Clinton's signing of the Oklahoma City National Memorial Act of 1997. It was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same day. The memorial is administered by Oklahoma City National Memorial Foundation, with National Park Service staff to help interpret the memorial for visitors. The National Memorial Museum and the Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism are components housed in the former Journal Record Building on the north side of the memorial grounds.\nThe memorial was formally dedicated on April 19, 2000: the fifth anniversary of the bombing. The museum was dedicated and opened the following year on February 19.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked a Ryder rental truck filled with explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The resulting explosion killed 168 people and destroyed the entire north face of the building.\nMonths after the attack, Mayor Ron Norick appointed a task force to look into a creation of a permanent memorial where the Murrah building once stood. The Task Force called for 'a symbolic outdoor memorial', a Memorial Museum, and for creation of Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. Six hundred and twenty four designs were submitted for the memorial and on July 1997 a design by Butzer Design Partnership, which consists of husband and wife Hans and Torrey Butzer, was chosen.\nOn October 1997, President Bill Clinton signed law creating the Oklahoma City National Memorial as a unit of the National Park Service to be operated by the Oklahoma City National Memorial Trust. The total cost of the memorial was $29.1 million; $10 million for the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial, $7 million for the Memorial Museum, $5 million for the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism and the rest for other costs. The federal government appropriated $5 million for construction with the state of Oklahoma matching that amount. More than $17 million in private donations was raised.\nOn April 19, 2000 the fifth anniversary of the attack, the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial was dedicated. On February 19, 2001 the Memorial Museum was dedicated. The Oklahoma City National Memorial since its opening has seen over 4.4 million visitors to the Outdoor Symbolic Memorial and 1.6 million visitors to the Memorial Museum. The Memorial has an average of 350,000 visitors per year.\n\n\n== Memorial features ==\nThe Outdoor Symbolic Memorial consists of the following segments on 3.3 acres (13,000 m2); it can be visited 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\nThe Gates of Time: Monumental twin bronze gates frame the moment of destruction \u2013 9:02 \u2013 and mark the formal entrances to the Outdoor Memorial. 9:01, found on the eastern gate, represents the last moments of peace, while its opposite on the western gate, 9:03, represents the first moments of recovery. Both time stamps are inscribed on the interior of the monument, facing each other and the Reflecting Pool.\nThe outside of each gate bears this inscription:\n\nReflecting Pool: A thin layer of water flows over polished black granite to form the pool, which runs east to west down the center of the Memorial (also see reflecting pool) on what was once Fifth Street. Although the pool is flowing, visitors are able to see a mirror image of themselves in the water. Visitors seeing their reflections are said to be seeing \"someone changed forever by what happened here.\"\nField of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, and stone represent those who lost their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on the site where the Murrah Building once stood. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.\nSurvivors' Wall: The only remaining original portions of the Murrah Building are the north and east walls, known as the Survivors' Wall. The Survivors' Wall includes several panels of granite salvaged from the Murrah Building itself, inscribed with the names of more than 600 survivors from the building and the surrounding area, many of whom were injured in the blast.\nThe Survivor Tree: An American elm on the north side of the Memorial, this was the only shade tree in the parking lot across the street from the Murrah Building. Commuters arrived early to get one of the shady parking spots provided by its branches. Photos of Oklahoma City taken in the 1920s show the tree to be about 100 years old. The tree was taken for granted prior to the blast. Heavily damaged by the bomb, the tree survived after nearly being chopped down during the initial investigation, when workers wanted to recover evidence hanging in its branches and embedded in its bark.\nThe force of the blast ripped most of the branches from the Survivor Tree. Glass and debris were embedded in its trunk and fire from the cars parked beneath it blackened what was left. Most thought the tree could not survive. Almost a year after the bombing, family members, survivors, and rescue workers gathered for a memorial ceremony by the tree noticed it was beginning to bloom again. The Survivor Tree now thrives, and the Outdoor Memorial design includes a mandate to feature and protect the tree. For example, one of the roots that would have been cut by the wall surrounding the tree was placed inside a large pipe so it could reach the soil beyond the wall without being damaged. The decking around the tree was raised several feet to make an underground crawlspace; workers enter through a secure hatchway and monitor the health of the tree and maintain its very deep roots.\nThe inscription around the inside of the deck wall around the Survivor Tree reads:\n\nHundreds of seeds from the Survivor Tree are planted annually and the resulting saplings are distributed each year on the anniversary of the bombing. Thousands of Survivor Trees are growing in public and private places all over the United States.\n\nThe Memorial Fence: A 10-foot-tall (3.0 m) chain link fence was installed around the area that is now the Reflecting Pool and the Field of Empty Chairs to protect the site from damage and visitors from injury. The Fence stood for more than four years, becoming notable as the place where visitors left stuffed animals, poems, keychains, and other items as tributes. During the construction of the Outdoor Memorial, 210 feet (64 m) of the Fence was moved to the west side of the Memorial, along the 9:03 side or the 'healing' side. The remainder of the Fence is in storage. Visitors may still leave small items along and in the Fence; the mementos are periodically collected, cataloged, and stored.\nRescuers' Orchard: A grove of Oklahoma redbuds (Oklahoma's state tree), Amur Maple, Chinese Pistache, and Bosque Elm trees are planted on the lawn around the Survivor Tree. The trees represent the rescuers who came to the aid of the survivors; hence the rescuer's orchard surrounds the survivor tree. The non-native species represent those rescuers who came from outside Oklahoma to help.\nChildren's Area: More than 5,000 hand-painted tiles, from all over the United States and Canada, were made by children and sent to Oklahoma City after the bombing in 1995. Most are stored in the Memorial's Archives, and a sampling of tiles is on the wall in the Children's Area. Chalkboards provide a place where children can draw and share their feelings. The Children's Area is north of the 9:03 gate, on the west side of the Museum.\nJournal Record Building: North of the memorial is the Journal Record Building, which formerly housed the offices of The Journal Record. It now houses the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum, which features numerous exhibits and artifacts related to the Oklahoma City bombing. Staff of the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a non-partisan think tank created shortly after the bombing by family members and survivors, also work here to spread knowledge of terrorism and its prevention.\nAlfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza: Located just south of the Field of Empty Chairs, above the underground parking garage, is the raised Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building Plaza. An original part of the federal building, the plaza had a garden and seating areas, as well as a playground for the daycare center. Visitors to the Memorial can walk across the plaza, where the original flagpole is used for the American flag.\n\n\n== Adjacent memorials ==\nTwo churches were located across the street from the Murrah Building. Both were heavily damaged by the blast. Each church was repaired and both constructed memorials on their property. While not part of the official memorial they are open to the public.\nHeartland Chapel: Across the street from the 9:01 gate is an open air wooden chapel erected by First United Methodist Church of Oklahoma City. The altar is made from church stones damaged by the bombing. A substantial portion of the funding for the chapel was provided by the Jewish community.\nAnd Jesus Wept: Across the street from the 9:03 gate is a sculpture of Jesus weeping erected by St. Joseph's Catholic Church, one of the first brick-and-mortar churches built in the city. Jesus faces away from the devastation, covering his face with his hand. In front of Jesus is a wall with 168 gaps in it, representing the voids left by each life lost.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliography\nThe National Parks: Index 2001\u20132003.

            "content": "Ferries and steamboats of Lake Crescent, Washington were used for water transport of passengers and freight before highways were built in the area in the early 1920s. Prior to highway construction, Lake Crescent was used as a route from Port Townsend into the northwestern part of the Olympic Peninsula. Ferries, steamboats and similar water craft were built and used on the lake until the Olympic Highway was completed along the south shore of the lake in 1922.\n\n\n== Points accessed by water ==\n\n\n=== Lake Crescent Lodge ===\nLake Crescent Lodge was originally known as Singer's Lake Crescent Tavern, built by Avery J and Julia Singer in the early part of the last century. The ferries on the lake ran to points west from the East Beach dock near the tavern.\n\n\n=== Ovington's Resort ===\nOvington's was located along the north shore of Lake Crescent, near the modern North Shore picnic area. Built by Edward J. \u201cNed\u201d Ovington and his wife Emily in 1905, it was one of the most popular resorts on the lake. Guests to Ovington's first arrived by boat, before the construction of the north shore road.\n\n\n=== Marymere Hotel ===\nThe Barnes family built the Marymere Hotel in 1906. It was located at Barnes Point at the narrowest part of the lake, on the south shore, at the base of Mount Storm King. Until the road was built on the shore of the lake, guests of the Marymere arrived by boat. The hotel burned down around 1914.\n\n\n== Construction and operations ==\nIn 1913, Michael Earles, owner of the Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort, built on Lake Crescent the gasoline-launch Betty Earles (named after his daughter) to take guests bound for his lodge from the head of the lake to Fairholm, at the western end, where they would disembark and ride motor buses up to his resort. The boat was large for the lake, 65' long, 16.5' on the beam, with an 80 horsepower (60 kW) heavy-duty Frisco Standard engine.\nThe next year, 1914, Captain O.D. Treiber designed for Clallam County the gasoline-powered side wheel ferry Marjory, which was 65' long, 27' on the beam, and powered by an 18 horsepower (13 kW) Field engine. Marjory was operated on the same route as the Betty Earles, and had a capacity of seven automobiles and 50 passengers.\nTreiber designed another, larger ferry for the Lake Crescent service. This was Storm King, named after a mountain overlooking the lake. Like Marjory, Storm King was a sidewheeler, but much larger. On deck, she was 112' long and measured 31.5' on the beam across her wheels. (Her hull measurements were 90' long, 20.5' on the beam.) Storm King, powered by a 40 horsepower (30 kW) Fairbanks-Morse engine, was probably the largest vessel ever on Lake Crescent. She could carry 21 automobiles and 150 passengers, exactly triple the capacity of Marjory.\nMichael Earles\u2019 Sol Duc lodge burned down around 1918, and he moved Betty Earles off Lake Crescent to serve on Puget Sound under the command of Captain O. G. Olson. Later, in 1924, Betty Earles was sold to Tacoma Tug & Barge Co. Remarkably, Betty Earles was still in service as a tug as late as 1958, still under her old name.\nLake Crescent also supported its own little fleet of steam and gasoline launches, with idyllic or at least speedy-sounding names: Lady of the Lake, Olympus, Greyhound, and Flyer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMagnuson, Craig, History of Lake Crescent accessed 1/27/08",

            "content": "Kart racing or karting is a variant of open-wheel motorsport with small, open, four-wheeled vehicles called karts, go-karts, or gearbox/shifter karts depending on the design. They are usually raced on scaled-down circuits. Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, for example Ginetta Juniors, FIA Formula 4, FIA Formula 3, FIA Formula 2 and FIA Formula 1.\nKarting is where people like Nico Rosberg, Ayrton Senna, Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher started.\nKarts vary widely in speed and some (known as Superkarts) can reach speeds exceeding 260 kilometres per hour (160 mph), while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAmerican Art Ingels is generally accepted to be the father of karting. A veteran hot rodder and a race car builder at Kurtis Kraft, he built the first kart in Southern California in 1956. Instantly popular, Karting rapidly spread to other countries, and currently has a large following in Europe.\nThe first kart manufacturer was an American company, Go Kart Manufacturing Co. (1958). In 1959, McCulloch was the first company to produce engines for karts. Its first engine, the McCulloch MC-10, was an adapted chainsaw two-stroke engine. Later, in the 1960s, motorcycle engines were also adapted for kart use, before dedicated manufacturers, especially in Italy (IAME), started to build engines for the sport.\n\n\n== Components ==\n\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe chassis are made of chrome moly tubing. There is no suspension, therefore chassis have to be flexible enough to work as a suspension and stiff enough not to break or give way on a turn. Kart chassis are classified in the USA as 'Open', 'Caged', 'Straight' or 'Offset'. All Commission Internationale de Karting - F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile or CIK-FIA approved chassis are 'Straight' and 'Open'.\nOpen karts have no roll cage.\nCaged karts have a roll cage surrounding the driver; they are mostly used on dirt tracks.\nIn Straight chassis the driver sits in the center. Straight chassis are used for sprint racing.\nIn Offset chassis the driver sits on the left side. Offset chassis are used for left-turn-only speedway racing.\nThe stiffness of the chassis enables different handling characteristics for different circumstances. Typically, for dry conditions a stiffer chassis is preferable, while in wet or other poor traction conditions, a more flexible chassis may work better. The best chassis allow for stiffening bars at the rear, front and side to be added or removed according to race conditions.\nBraking is achieved by a disc brake mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front and one for the rear and are adjustable to allow for front/ rear bias changes.\nProfessionally raced karts typically weigh 165 to 175 lb (75 to 79 kg), complete without driver. Avanti, Tony Kart, Trulli, Birel, CRG, Gillard, Intrepid, Kosmic, Zanardi or FA Kart and EKS are a few well known examples of the many European manufacturers of race-quality chassis. Emmick, Coyote, Bandit, Shadow, MGM, Titan, PRC and Margay are American companies producing kart chassis.\n\n\n=== Engines ===\n\nAmusement park go-karts can be powered by 4-stroke engines or electric motors, while racing karts use small 2-stroke or 4-stroke engines.\n4-stroke engines can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about 5 to 20 hp. Briggs & Stratton, Tecumseh, Kohler, Robin, and Honda are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful four-stroke engines available from manufacturers like Yamaha, TKM, Swissauto or Aixro (Wankel engine) offering from 15 hp up to 48 hp. They run to and around 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. Those are used in some National Championship classes like the two-strokes.\n2-stroke kart engines are developed and built by dedicated manufacturers. WTP, Comer, IAME (Parilla, Komet, Woltjer), TM, Vortex, Titan, REFO, TKM, PRD, Yamaha and Rotax are manufacturers of such engines. These can develop from about 8 hp for a single-cylinder 60 cc unit (MiniROK by Vortex) to over 90 hp for a twin 250 cc. Today, the most popular categories worldwide are those using the TaG 125 cc units. The recent 125 cc KF1 engines are electronically limited at 16,000 rpm. Most are water-cooled today; however, previously air-cooled engines dominated the sport.\n\n\n=== Transmission ===\nKarts do not have a differential. The lack of a differential means that one rear tire must slide while cornering; this is achieved by designing the chassis so that the inside rear tire lifts up slightly when the kart turns the corner. This allows the tire to lose some of its grip and slide or lift off the ground completely.\nPower is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by a chain. Both engine and axle sprockets are removable; their ratio must be adapted to the track configuration in order to get the most from the engine.\nIn the early days, karts were direct drive only (requiring push starts), but the inconvenience of that setup soon led to the centrifugal clutch for the club level classes. Dry centrifugal clutches are now used in many categories (Rotax Max is one example) and have become the norm as the top international classes have switched to 125 cc clutched engines as of January 2007.\n\n\n=== Tires ===\nWheels and tires are much smaller than those used on a normal car. Rims are made of magnesium alloy, aluminum, or composite materials. Tires can support cornering forces in excess of 2 g (20 m/s\u00b2), depending on chassis, engine, and motor setup. Some car tire manufacturers, such as Bridgestone, Dunlop, and Maxxis make tires for karts. There are also specific kart tire manufacturers, which include MG, MOJO, Vega, Hoosier and Burris.\nSimilar to other motorsports, kart tires have different types for use appropriate to track conditions:\nSlicks, for dry track. Slick kart tires come in many different compounds, from very soft (maximum grip) to very hard (amusement and rental karts, less grip but long life span). In international level racing, because the drivers are free to choose their tires and because of the short duration of each round (10 to 20 mn maximum), these are some of the softest tires found in motorsport.\nRain tires, or \"wets\", for wet weather. They are grooved, made of soft compound, and are narrower than slicks. Not all racing classes allow rain tires.\nSpecial, such as spiked tires for icy conditions, or \"cuts/grooved\" for high grip dirt/clay speedways. Cuts are slicks modified with a lathe to optimize handling. Tire manufacturers such as Hoosier and Burris also make a slightly larger grooved tire only used in dirt track racing.\n\n\n=== Data acquisition ===\nAs in other motor sports, several data acquisition systems have been developed for kart racing. These systems allow the driver to monitor from a display fixed on the steering wheel some parameters such as RPM, timing of laps (including sectors), number of laps, best lap, cooling system temperature, exhaust gas temperature and sometimes speed or even gear for shifter karts.\nSome of those systems are able to record (logging) laps data from the sensors, allowing replay of an entire running session or/and direct download to a personal computer equipped with a data analysis software. More sophisticated systems allow for more information such as lateral and longitudinal acceleration (g-force), throttle position, steering wheel position and brake pressure.\n\n\n== Racing ==\n\nKart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of motorsport available on four wheels. As a free-time activity, it can be performed by almost anybody, and as a motorsport in itself, it is one of the sports regulated by FIA (under the name of CIK), permitting licensed racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward.\nIn the USA, there is not as much FIA involvement; instead, many organizations regulate racing, such as the IKF (International Kart Federation), WKA (World Karting Association), KART (Karters of America Racing Triad), USPKS (United States Pro Karting Series).\nIn the UK, the MSA (Motor Sports Association) regulates most 'owner driver' Karting. Some associations, such as NatSKA (National Schools Karting Association), organize race meetings throughout the country under the authority of the MSA. Various four-stroke 'hire kart' series such as EPEC (European Prokart Endurance Championship) or BRKC (British Rental Kart Championship) fall outside the governance of the MSA. Billed as the UK's first national karting league, the Elite Karting League also falls outside of MSA governance.\nIn Australia, kart racing is administered by the Australian Karting Association on the behalf of FIA and CAMS. There is a manual released every year detailing the various rules and regulations that race meetings and drivers have to follow.\nRacing classes start at age 7 or 8 (5 in the US with \"Kid Karts\") and generally run in 3-year age groupings or weight divisions until \"senior\" status is reached at age 15 or 16, depending on the series.\n\n\n=== Racing formats ===\nTypically, race formats are one of the following:\n\n\n==== Sprint ====\nSprint racing takes place on dedicated kart circuits resembling small road courses, with left and right turns. Tracks range from 1/4 mile (400 metres) to over 1 mile (1,600 metres) in length.\nThe sprint format is a series of short-duration races, normally for a small number of laps, that qualify for a final, with a variety of point scoring calculations to determine the event's overall winner. Typical duration does not normally exceed 15 minutes. Here, speed and successful passing is of the most importance. It normally occurs in the format of three qualifying heats and a final race for trophy positions.\nThe FIA championships, including the Karting World Championship, take place in this format.\n\n\n==== Endurance ====\n\nEndurance races last for an extended period, ranging from 30 minutes up to 24 hours or more, for one or more drivers. In general, consistency, reliability, and pit strategy is of greater importance than all out speed.\nCalled \"Enduro\" racing in the USA, most WKA & IKF sanctioned events typically last 30 minutes (Sprint Enduro) or 45 minutes (Laydown Enduro) and are run continuous without pit stops. Enduro events are held on full-size road racing circuits that are usually between 1.5 & 4 miles in length.\nAs well as the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race for automobiles there is also a 24 hours event for karts which takes place at the kart circuit Alain Prost at Le Mans, France. This race has taken place since 1986 and its winners list include four times Champ Car champion S\u00e9bastien Bourdais (in 1996).\n\n\n==== Speedway ====\nSpeedway racing takes place on asphalt or clay oval tracks which are normally between 1/10 mile and 1/4 mile long. Tracks primarily consist of two straights and four left-turn corners, few tracks are symmetric and often the shape parallels that of an egg or a tri-oval.\n'Offset' kart chassis have been developed for precise handling and adjustability in left-turn-only racing competition taking place on oval and tri-oval tracks.\nSpeedway kart races range in length from 4 laps for a trophy dash, to 20 laps for a main event.\nThe two chief racing formats used in dirt speedway karting are heat races and timed laps qualification:\nThe International Kart Federation (IKF) runs a racing format of two 10 lap heats followed by a 20 lap final. Finishing positions in the two heat races are used to calculate the starting position in the feature race.\nThe World Karting Association (WKA) uses time qualifying. Karts equipped with transponders are sent out onto the track in groups of 5 or less to try to achieve the fastest lap time. Positions for the 20 laps feature event are determined by qualifying time.\nThe American Kart Racing Association (AKRA) uses group transponder qualifying to calculate starting positions for 20-lap features.\n\n\n=== Racing categories ===\nThere are many different classes or formula in karting.\n\n\n==== International ====\n\nThe CIK-FIA sanctions international championships in OKJ, OK, KZ1, KZ2 and Superkart. These are regarded as the top level classes of karting and are also raced in national championships worldwide. The World Championship is decided here.\nCIK-FIA categories:\nOK (the top level) and OKJ for a younger age group. All are using the same water-cooled no-gearbox 125 cc \"long life\" two-stroke engines which are direct drive, each with different technical specifications (mufflers, air boxes, carburetor, rev limit etc.).\nKZ1 and KZ2, both 125 cc gearbox categories.\nSuperkart, a 250 cc gearbox category.\nNon CIK-FIA categories: The Kart World Championship (or KWC) as opposed to the FIA's 'Karting World Championship' uses 4-stroke rental karts and travels to a different country each year.\n\n\n==== National ====\nIn the UK, the most celebrated karting series is the National karting series, also known as Super One. There are three types of Super One championships:\nMSA series: KF2, KF3, Formula KGP, Super Cadet and Cadet\nRotax series: Minimax, Junior Max, Senior Max, Senior Max 177\nTKM series: Formula Junior TKM, Formula TKM Extreme, TKM Senior 4-stroke and since 2006, Honda Cadet\nOther UK National Championships include: Birel BirelART series UK: Cadet 60cc, Junior 100cc, Senior Light 125cc, Senior Heavy 125cc\nThe BRKC is the UK's rental karting National championship, and the UK's official feeder series to the rental Kart World Championship.\nNatSKA is a budget karting association set up for schools and youth groups in the UK, with 13 classes.\nIn the United States, Dirt oval classes (which often use Briggs & Stratton industrial engines) are prominent in the Southeast and Midwest. In the West, European style sprint racing is much more common. In particular, 125cc shifter karts using Honda CR125 power units have gained tremendous popularity in recent years.\nIn Australia, classes include Cadet (previously called Midget), Rookie, Junior National Pro, Junior National, Junior Clubman, Junior Rotax (Jmax), KF3, Senior National, Senior Rotax, Senior Clubman, Senior TAG (Restricted and Unrestricted). Most classes run a light and heavy category (with some running super heavy).\nMany people race worldwide in Spec series such as Rotax Max (a TaG class) or those using the Yamaha KT100 engine.\n\n\n=== Racing licenses ===\nAs in other disciplines in motorsports, a license is required to drive a racing kart on a circuit or enter competitions. The licenses, issued by governing bodies, are provided by clubs or associations. Most of the time, but not always, a basic insurance coverage is included in the licence annual fee. In some countries, such as France, regulations require the drivers to pass a medical exam each year.\nLicense classes differ between countries according to age groups or levels. Most of the time a Practice License can be easily obtained, while a Racing License might require a capability assessment.\n\n\n=== Driver equipment ===\nFor their safety, kart drivers are required to wear proper equipment:\nFull-face helmet (Snell SA2005 or K2005 certification is required for racing, K2005 is same as SA2005 without fire resistance)\nRacing Balaclava\nDriving suit (abrasion resistant overalls with at least one Cordura external layer, CIK-FIA Level 2 homologation for top level racing)\nGloves\nDriving boots (ankles must be covered)\nRib protector and neck brace, although highly recommended, are optional in most countries. None of the above need to be made of fire retardant material. Superkart drivers are required to wear leather overalls, similar to those used in motorcycling.\n\n\n== Karting as a learning tool ==\nKart racing is usually used as a low-cost and relatively safe way to introduce drivers to motor racing. Many Formula One drivers grew up racing karts, most prominent among them, World Champions Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Alain Prost, Fernando Alonso, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. Many NASCAR drivers also got their start in racing from karts, such as Darrell Waltrip, Danica Patrick, Lake Speed, Ricky Rudd, Juan Pablo Montoya, Tony Stewart, and Jeff Gordon.\nIn August 2009, in anticipation to a possible return to F1 with Ferrari, Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher did some preparation driving a kart in Lonato, Italy. Schumacher also raced at the SKUSA SuperNationals, an event taking place each year in Las Vegas, along with F1 drivers S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Nelson Piquet Jr.. Felipe Massa also used karting in September 2009 to test his condition in Brazil, two months after his Hungarian Grand Prix accident during qualifying.\n\n\n== Recreational, concession and indoor Karts ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nKart circuit\nKart manufacturers\nKart Racing Championships\nRelated:\nCapeta\nCrosskart\nGo-kart\nKart racing games\nMicro kart\nSmall engine\nSuperkart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKart racing at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\n- DynoCams - Your one-stop shop for karting components and accessories\nGoverning Bodies:\nhttp://www.KartingConnect.com \u2013 A social networking service that allows members to create, share, discuss and communicate with other karting enthusiasts.\ncorporate sports league web site\nCIK-FIA web site\nMSA \u2013 Motor Sports Association \u2013 Governing body for motor sports in Great Britain\nIKF \u2013 International Kart Federation \u2013 Governing body for the sport of kart racing in the US, mainly West Coast\nWKA \u2013 World Karting Association \u2013 Governing body for karting in the US, mainly East Coast\nAKRA \u2013 American Kart Racing Association \u2013 Governing body for speedway oval karting in the US\nAKA \u2013 Australian Karting Association \u2013 Governing body for karting in Australia\nASN Canada \u2013 Governing body for kart racing in Canada\nNatSKA \u2013 National Association of Schools and Youth Group Karting \u2013 UK\nVKA \u2013 Vintage Karting Association \u2013 Association for support of karts from karting's 1956 inception to 1975",

            "content": "The Chicago \u2013 New York Electric Air Line Railroad (CNY) was a proposed high-speed electric air-line railroad between Chicago and New York City. At roughly 750 miles (1,210 km) it would have been over 150 miles (240 km) shorter than the two primary steam railroads on that route, the New York Central Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad. The promoters' vision proved wildly optimistic, and in the end only a short interurban route in the vicinity of Gary, Indiana, was built and operated. It was the most ambitious of several such proposals, all of which ended in failure.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe Air Line was not the first proposed high-speed electric railway. In 1893 Dr. Wellington Adams promoted a 252-mile (406 km) Chicago\u2013St. Louis route with a maximum operating speed of 100 miles per hour (160 km/h). Adams believed the new railroad could be built in a year for $5.5 million. Trade publications ridiculed the proposal and it went nowhere.\nThe proposed Air Line, first announced in 1906, was far more ambitious than that proposal. The proposed physical characteristics of the route were impressive and far ahead of contemporary practice: grades not exceeding 1%, no grade crossings, and straight route which would be 150 miles (240 km) shorter than other routes. Trains would run at 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) and complete the journey between Chicago and New York in 10 hours. At the time the two fastest trains between New York and Chicago, the New York Central Railroad's 20th Century Limited and the Pennsylvania Railroad's Pennsylvania Special (forerunner of the more famous Broadway Limited), each required twenty hours to make the journey.\nEven as this project was announced global developments in electric railroading proceeded apace. In 1903, a railcar from Siemens & Halske and AEG reached 200 kilometres per hour (120 mph) on the experimental Marienfelde\u2013Zossen military railway outside Berlin. Commercial projects, however, did not progress. Proposed electric railways such as Berlin\u2013Hamburg and Wien\u2013Budapest proved too expensive. Several interurbans in the United States had made fast demonstration runs. In 1903 an interurban on the Aurora, Elgin & Chicago Railway covered the 35 miles (56 km) between Aurora and Chicago in 34 minutes 39 seconds despite the loss of over 6 minutes in stops, and numerous speed reductions for steam railroads, trolley lines (tramways), and street and highway crossings. In 1905 Pacific Electric mogul Henry E. Huntington made the Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach run (20 miles (32 km)) in 15 minutes in a private railcar at an average speed at 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) was higher than for the projected Air Line trains.\n\n\n=== Rise and fall ===\n\nThe project was trumpeted nationally, stock sold with great rapidity, sections of track and immense cuts-and-fills were built in the vicinity of Gary, Indiana, and operated as interurban transit, and investors were taken out to view these portions of the line in operation. It was promoted by the monthly Air Line News, which dramatized every development in the construction work (e.g., \"A huge Vulcan steam shovel is already on the job, taking big bites out of hills that stand in the path of the straight and level speedway that is to be the Air Line\")(Middleton 1968, p. 29).\nThe project had some weaknesses, and the depression of 1907\u20131908 worsened the problems. The immense expenses occasioned by the incredibly stringent engineering specifications, and some claimed (but never prosecuted or substantiated) accounting irregularities and other fraud, led to the failure of the main line to expand beyond several dozen miles through the Indiana countryside. The largest completed was a 19.2-mile (30.9 km) segment between LaPorte and Goodrum, Indiana.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe project is called the greatest fiasco of the interurban era (Middleton 1968, p. 29). However, the completed portions became the foundation of Gary Railways, a successful interurban street railway system. And several other interurbans by as high standard as the Air Line \u2013 though at a much less scale \u2013 were built. In 1907, the Philadelphia and Western Railroad opened its Upper Darby\u2013Strafford line near Philadelphia with maximum grades of 2%, no grade crossings, and an absolute block signalling system (Middleton 1968, p. 109). And after World War I, the railway tycoon Samuel Insull upgraded the interurbans around Chicago, and station-to-station averages as high as 70 miles per hour were frequently attained (Middleton 1968, p. 67). Parts of these lines are in use even today.\nSections of the Air Line\u2019s right-of-way and some of the colossal concrete bridge supports are still visible to this day.\nIn 1943, Commander Edwin J. Quinby wrote a lengthy history of the CNYEALRR for the publication Electric Railroads and closed the report with the following:\n\nAnd as time goes on, electric railroad enthusiasts will visit the right-of-way over which the original construction work was done\u2014and some of the more imaginative individuals will hear the deep-throated whistle of a big palatial interurban as its spirit still streaks along this romantic pike, and they will catch a glimpse of the golden inscription CHICAGO on one end of the car as it flashes by, and NEW YORK on the other end\u2014hurrying, hurrying\u2014for 36 years have passed since it started on its swift way and it hasn't reached either place.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCrane, Mary. \"Chicago - New York Electric Air Line Railroad,\" Trains magazine, October 1946.\nGradenwitz, Alfred (July 20, 1904). \"The Marienfelde\u2013Zossen High Speed Trials\".

Tkachenko won two Summer Olympic Games medals and three FIBA World Cup medals with the senior men's Soviet Union national basketball team. He was also named both the Euroscar and the Mr. Europa in 1979. His club career lasted 16 years. He is a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Player profile ==\nTkachenko, a 7 ft 3 in (2.21 m), 310 lb (140 kg) center, was a great defensive player. He could block out 2-3 opponents to give teammates a chance to grab a rebound. His offensive ability was important too, as his post up moves were basic, but effective, and his shooting was good for a player of his size, with a range of approximately 17 feet.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nTkachenko began playing for Stroitel of the USSR Premiere League during the 1973\u201374 season, when he was 16 years old. He continued to play for them through the 1981-82 season. In 1983, he began playing for the USSR League CSKA Moscow, and he stayed there through the 1988\u201389 season. He finished his club career in the former Spanish 2nd division with Guadalajara, in the 1989\u201390 season.\n\n\n== Soviet Union national team ==\nFrom 1976 to 1987, Tkachenko played on the senior men's Soviet Union national basketball team, participating in many FIBA EuroBasket and FIBA World Cup competitions. With the Soviet national team he won numerous medals, including: two bronze medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics Games and at the 1980 Summer Olympics games, the gold medal at the 1982 FIBA World Championship (also silver medals at the 1978 FIBA World Championship and the 1986 FIBA World Championship); as well as three gold medals at the FIBA EuroBasket: at the FIBA EuroBasket 1979, the FIBA EuroBasket 1981, and the FIBA EuroBasket 1985 (also silvers at the FIBA EuroBasket 1977 and the FIBA EuroBasket 1987).\n\n\n== References ==",

The Fire Rose (1995, ISBN 0-671-87750-X) based on Beauty and the Beast\nThe Serpent's Shadow (2001, ISBN 0-7564-0061-9) based on Snow White\nThe Gates of Sleep (2002, ISBN 0-7564-0101-1) based on Sleeping Beauty\nPhoenix And Ashes (2004, ISBN 0-7564-0272-7) based on Cinderella\nThe Wizard of London (October 2005, ISBN 0-7564-0174-7) based on The Snow Queen\nReserved for the Cat (October 2007,ISBN 978-0-7564-0362-1) based on Puss in Boots\nUnnatural Issue (June 2011, ISBN 978-0756405755) based on Donkeyskin or similar tale\nHome From the Sea (June 2012, ISBN 978-0756407278) based on East of the Sun and West of the Moon, Tam Lin, and The Great Silkie of Sule Skerry\nSteadfast (June 2013, ISBN 978-0756408015) based on the Steadfast Tin Soldier\nBlood Red (June 2014, ISBN 978-0756408978) based on Red Riding Hood\nFrom a High Tower (June 2015, ISBN 978-0756408985) based on Rapunzel\nA Study in Sable (June 2016, ISBN 978-0756408725) featuring Sherlock Holmes and based on The Twa Sisters\nA Scandal in Battersea (October 2017, ISBN 978-0756408732) featuring Sherlock Holmes\nBaen Books published The Fire Rose before the series was established as such. DAW Books published the remaining titles, inaugurating the \"Elemental Masters\" moniker and numeration. Hence Serpent's Shadow is the first numbered title in the series.\nIn addition to the main books, two anthologies (Elemental Magic released in December 2012, and Elementary released in December 2013) have been published, containing works by various fantasy and science fiction authors set in the Elemental Masters universe.\n\n\n== World ==\nThe setting of the \"Elemental Masters\" is an alternative Earth during the early 1900s. The main and perhaps sole difference between this world and our reality is that magic exists, controlled by those who have mastery over the four classical elements (fire, air, water, earth). The majority of the tales take place in England, with The Fire Rose taking place in North America and focusing on the San Francisco area, while Blood Red and From a High Tower are set in Germany, with a focus on the Black Forest. While history does tend to follow the real-life time line, historic calamities such as the Great Chicago Fire and the earthquake in San Francisco are attributed to the elemental mages that serve as the series namesakes. Also the 1918 flu pandemic is hinted in Phoenix and Ashes to be due to the machinations of a malevolent Master.\n\n\n== Magic ==\nThe world of the \"Elemental Masters\" is home to two main types of magic: the elemental magic that plays an important part in the series and ESP that is largely explored in The Wizard of London. There have been mentions of different types and degrees of magical ability in the series.\n\n\n=== Elemental magic ===\nElemental magic is the most commonly seen form of magic in the series, with every book having at least a couple of elemental masters as major characters, with one serving as the antagonist. The masters' abilities are tied with their ability to see and control spirits of a particular elemental affinity. Different regions of the world have different Elementals. Elemental magicians are classed by their affinity (Earth, Air, Fire, and/or Water) and by their mastery of their magic; one can be an Elemental Magician or an Elemental Master. It is mentioned in Blood Red that there is a fifth kind of magic, Spirit, which has no Masters, as the Masters of this element would be able to control the very angels of heaven, and as such no master can be born of this element. This is later proven to not be the case in \"A Study In Sable\", which features a Master of Spirit who uses a violin to summon spirits and communicate with them.\n\n\n==== The Power of Ice & Necromancy ====\nThe power of Ice can be the seen as a partial exception of the normal abilities of an Elemental mage. Ice can be controlled by a skilled master of Fire, with cold being the inverse of heat. As seen in The Wizard of London, the power of ice is seen as a perversion and innately destructive, as it calls for a basic twisting of a master's nature as well as the world around them.\nSimilarly, Necromancy, the power of death, in Unnatural Issue is a destructive perversion of the power of Earth.\nIf Water and Air have similar perversions, we have not yet seen them.\n\n\n=== The Talented ===\nMost of the details given about the talented (those who have some degree of psychic abilities) are seen in The Wizard of London. While the talented in most part fit the descriptions and abilities given psychics in the modern world, there are two main differences. First, certain psychics are able to gain familiars; the second difference is that powerful talents or the talented have psychic Avatars that represent their duties as champions of the light. These avatars tend to draw imagery from fiction and the past.\n\n\n=== Sensitives ===\nDetails are given in Reserved for the Cat. Sensitives are those who do not have direct magical talents but are able to see and feel to a degree, magic cast by the Elemental Wizards. Some are capable of seeing and sometimes communicating with elemental spirits. Some sensitives may also cast small magics that are often based on emotions. A powerful Sensitive can use their powers to influence people. Sensitives often form the bulk of an Elemental Wizards's household.\n\n\n=== Other forms of magic ===\nWhile psychics, wizards and elemental masters are portrayed as the more common magic users in the western world, the series also focuses on other forms of power such as the Hindu sorcerers of India and the various spirits of the world (such as the fey of England and avatars of the Hindu gods).\n\n\n=== Variation on Fairy Tale models ===\nEach book in the series is loosely based on a famous fairy tale. However, female protagonists in the books are noticeably stronger and more assertive than the fairy tale characters on which they are modeled. The Serpent's Shadow, The Gates of Sleep and Phoenix And Ashes are each based on fairy tales (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, respectively) in which a girl faces the malevolence of an older and far more powerful woman, before being saved by the intervention of a Prince. In Lackey's novels, the equivalent character does not merely wait passively to be saved, and rather takes an active role in fighting for herself, on equal terms with the male character. Interestingly, much of this fierce fighting takes place in astral form, when the original fairy tale female was completely passive in deep sleep or coma.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Conjestina Achieng (born 20 October 1977 in Umiru village, Yala division, Siaya District. Conjestina is the fifth born in a family of ten. Her father Clement Adalo is a retired medical officer and her mother is Gertrude Auma. Her elder brother, Joseph Kusimba is an ex-boxer who runs a boxing club in Mathare, Nairobi. She is a Kenyan female boxer who has been nicknamed \"Hands of Stone\" and is ranked number five in the world. She became the first African woman to hold an international title when she beat Ugandan Fiona Tugume to take the vacant WIBF Middleweight title. She also lost out in controversial title fight circumstances to then WBC, and WBA Super middleweight Natascha Ragosina  Achieng, a single mother, plays in the middleweight division.\n\n\n== Sporting history ==\nHer passion for sports began at age 9 when she was a pupil at St. Jesus Primary School in Yala.\nConjestina took to the ring in 2000 after graduating through the youth soccer ranks in Nairobi's Makongeni Estate, inspired by her elder brother who was a member of the national boxing team. \"Being a boxer, he trained and nurtured me, taking me away from playing football to boxing. I trained in boxing for one month, before I was able to face my opponent in the amateur ranks. As an amateur, I once technically knocked out a Ugandan opponent, Sharon Akinyi.\"\nAfter seven amateur bouts, \"Conje\" made her pro debut on 8 June 2002 in Nairobi, winning a four-round decision over Naomi Wanjiku of Kenya who fell to 0-2.\nIn her second pro bout, also in Nairobi, she fought to a four-round draw with Damaris Muthoni of Nairobi, whose record was then 2--1-2 (1 KO).\nIn May 2003 in Nairobi she won a four-round decision over Jane Kavulani of Uganda who fell to 2-2-0 (0 KO).\nOn 13 December 2003 at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi she fought to a four-round draw with unbeaten Zarika Njeri, also of Nairobi, who was then 3-0-1 (1 KO).\nOn 28 August 2004 at Jam Rescue 2 Club in Nairobi, Conjestina fought to a four-round draw in a rematch with Jane Kavulani. On 23 October 2004 at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi Conjestina TKO'd Fiona Tugume of Uganda in the seventh round of a scheduled eight-rounder. Achieng consistently beat Fugume to the punch throughout this fight. Tugume fell to 4-1-1 (1 KO).\nOn 15 November 2004 at Triple A Hotel in Arusha, Tanzania, Conjestina lost a six-round unanimous decision to Monica Mwakasanga of Tanzania who improved to 4-0-1.\nOn 19 December 2004 at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi Conjestina won a ten-round unanimous (100-97.100-91,100-92) decision over Fiona Tugume for the vacant GBU Middleweight title. Tugume fell to 4-2-1 (1 KO) with the loss while Achieng became the first African woman to win a professional boxing title.\nOn 25 March 2005 at Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi, Kenya Conjestina knocked out Monica Mwakasanga of Tanzania midway through the fifth round of a scheduled six-rounder, dropping Mwakasanga to 5-1-1. A right hook sent Mwakasanga crashing to the canvas and the Tanzanian was rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital for a check-up. Achieng spoke of the revenge factor for her only loss prior to this bout, saying \"I wanted to punish her first before putting her to rest.\"\nOn 21 August 2005 at Moi International Sport Centre, Nairobi, Kasarani, Kenya, Conjestina TKO's Monica Mwakasanga in the ninth round of a scheduled ten-rounder for the WIBF Middleweight title. Mwakasanga fell to 5-2-1.\nOn 24 December 2005 at Kenyatta International Conference Centre in Nairobi, Kenya, Conjestina TKO'd Guillermina Fernandez of Argentina at 1:42 in the first round of a mismatch for the vacant WBF Middleweight title. Fernandez backtracked all the way and fell to 0-4 as her coach thrww in the towel after Fernandez took a mandatory eight count following a knockdown and then was assailed by a flurry of punches.\nOn 4 February 2006 at Nyayo National Stadium, Nairobi, Kenya 3000 spectators saw Conjestina win a hard-fought six-round unanimous decision over Monalisa Sibanda of Lusaka, Zimbabwe.\nOn 1 April 2006 at Moi International Sports Centre in Nairobi, Kenya, a partisan crowd of 3000 saw Yvonne Reis of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida win a ten-round split decision over Conjestina for the vacant WBC Middleweight title. Achieng came out aggressively and kept Reis on the defensive in the opening rounds, but from the fifth round onwards Reis began to assert her authority and Achieng tired. The judges' scorecards read Alfred Buqwana 96-94 for Reis, Nemes Kavishe 96-94 for Reis and Atta Eddie Pappoe 100-94 for Achieng. Yvonne Reis, who was the first southpaw Achieng had faced, improved to 6-9-1 (0 KO) with this win while Achieng fell to 8-2-3 (4 KOs) with her first loss in Kenya.\nOn 5 August 2006 at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi, Conjestina (159 lbs) bounced back from her loss to Yvonne Reis with a six-round unanimous decision over Florence Nalukwago (159\u00be lbs) of Uganda. For the third time in a row, Conjestina failed to make good her now famous threat \"Come Early coz I'll finish early\" when she had to slug it out for the whole six rounds against the heftily built Ugandan. Conjestina, who had a reputation for knocking out her opponents, had now failed to stop three in a row. Achieng improved to 9-2-3 (4 KOs). On 2 December 2006 at the Moi International Sport Center in Nairobi, Kenya, Janaya Davis (164\u00bc lbs) of Atlanta, Georgia won a six-round (60-58,58-56,59-55) unanimous decision over Conjestina (154\u00bc lbs) who fell to 9-3-3 (4 KO's) with her second home loss to a visiting American. Janaya Davis improved her record to 5-2 (1 KO) with the win. Achieng was slated to fight Texan Valerie Mahfood until a few days before the fight, but Mahfood withdrew. This was a disappointing outcome for Achieng, who had trained in Edison, New Jersey since her fight with Yvonne Reis.\nOn 20 January 2007 at the Travellers Beach Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, Laura Ramsey (160 lbs) of Lake Wales, Florida, United States, TKO'd Conjestina (159\u00be lbs) at 1:13 in the sixth round of a scheduled 10-round GBU Middleweight title bout. Kenyan news sources reported that Ramsey dominated the fight from the beginning, and could have won it in the second round when she sent Achieng into the ropes. In the sixth, she unleashed a heavy combination of punches that saw a hapless Conjestina hit the canvas, gasping for breath, and the referee stopped the fight at the five count. Ramsey took the fight on short notice to fight Achieng in her home turf when Kimberly Harris canceled out after suffering an injury. Ramsey improved to 8-2-0 (4 KOs) while Achieng fell to 9-4-3 (4 KO's) with her third home loss to a visiting American.\nOn 10 March 2007 at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi, Kenya Conjestina won a non-title fight by a 5th-round TKO of Tanzanian Monica Mwakasanga. Mwakasanga suffered a deep cut on her left eyebrow that forced the medics to advise the referee Shabaan Ogola to discontinue the fight. Achieng in the first of three non-title fights she has to win to be considered for any title challenges showed a different self when she comfortably switched to southpaw stance to contain her opponent. Mwakasanga gave a good account of herself despite suffering a second round knockdown. Mwakasanga kept her form by avoiding skillfully Achieng's hard right throughout the rounds. The Tanzanian left the ring bleeding profusely from a devastating hook from Achieng, vowing to return to Kenya for another encounter against her old foe. Mwakasanga fell to 3-4-1 (1 KOs)\nOn 12 May 2007 at Charter Hall in Nairobi, Kenya Conjestina won by a second round KO over Jalala Salum in a scheduled eight round bout. WBAN had not previously heard of Salum, who appeared to be making her debut. Local news sources reported the following: \"There was disappointment as the non title fight which was expected to be a thriller between Conjestina Achieng and Jalala Salum of Tanzania turned out to be a mismatch. Achieng outclassed her opponent in all the department of the game. The Tanzanian was worse than a novice boxer and it was hardly surprising when she lost.\" Achieng advanced to 11-3-2 (6 KOs).\nOn 14 July 2007 at Moi International Sport Centre in Kasarani, Nairobi, Kenya, Conjestina won a six-round bout by unanimous (60-54,60-54,60-55) decision over Emily Kabwalo. Achieng improved to 12-4-2 (6 KOs) while Kawalo fell to 0-1-0 (0 KOs).\nOn 12 December 2008 at Charter Hall in Nairobi, Conjestina won a six-round majority (58-58,60-56,57-55) decision over Charity Mukami of Nairobi, who fell to 1-1 with the loss.\nOn 13 April 2008 at Club Afrique in Nairobi, Conjestina (159\u00be lbs) TKO'd winless Patroba Lihavi of Eldoret, Kenya in the third round of a scheduled six-rounder. Lihavi fell to 0-3 with the loss.\nOn 11 July 2008 at Rundturnhalle in Cuxhaven, Germany Natascha Ragosina (168 lbs) of Magdeburg, Germany won by a 10-round unanimous (97-93,96-94,97-93) decision over Conjestina (167\u00bd lbs) for the WIBF and GBU Super Middleweight titles. WBAN correspondent Ewan Whyte wrote: \"She came dressed as Supergirl but it would be a lie to say Natascha Ragosina fought like a girl. She didn\u2019t fight at all. She \u2018boxed\u2019 (we are told), which meant trying to keep the challenger at arm\u2019s length (further still, if possible) for twenty short minutes while the clock ran down. She didn\u2019t even make a very good job of that, it has to be said; Achieng cornered her on quite a few occasions with surprising ease, and when she did, she landed some quite good punches. Ragosina neither landed nor even threw anything all night that would have smudged your granny\u2019s make-up, yet according to the promoter, Ulf Steinforth, the decision in her favor was correct. What we saw tonight, he told us, was 'a class boxer against a fighter'\". Ragosina advanced to 18-0 (11 KO's) with the win.\nOn 28 November 2008 at the Maritim Hotel in Magdeburg, Germany, Natascha Ragosina (165\u00bd lbs) of Germany won a second 10-round unanimous (97-93,99-91,98-92) decision over Conjestina (161\u00be lbs) defending her WIBF and WBA Super Middleweight titles. Erik Schmidt of BoxingNews24.com wrote that \"All in all, it was really terrible boxing to watch. Ragosina fought as if she were on a set of tall stilts, never bending her knees and walking stiff-legged around the ring. In rounds eight through ten, Achieng continued pressuring Ragosina constantly, landing the much harder shots and giving her a lot of problems. Ragosina never changed her game during these rounds, continuing to jab weakly, bend backwards to prevent getting hit and clinching constantly. At some point, the referee should have taken points away from her because she looked to be trying to run out the clock in the fight. Because of that, I couldn\u2019t give her any of the last three rounds and had Achieng easily winning in the end.\" Ragosina advanced to 19-0 (11 KO's) even as the decision was booed by the German crowd.\nOn 28 February 2009 at Hotel Casuarina in Nairobi, Conjestina won a six-round unanimous (59-54,59-55,60-57) decision over her perennial rival Charity Mukami of Nairobi. According to reporter Erick Ochieng: \"Achieng, who lived up to her earlier promise of causing havoc in the ring, took the match head on from the start. The boxers, who were unsettled at the start of the fight, ducked forth and back in the first round. Achieng then opened floodgates of punches on her rival\u2019s left temple to break the deadlock towards the end of round one, with agitated spectators fearing she would knockout Mukami in the second round, only to slow down in the second. 'I resolved to make the fight a training session rather than to go for my traditional KO', said Achieng. 'From the jabs I threw in the first round, I realised the duel was not going to be a furious one and so I decided to tone down.' But Mukami struck back furiously in the third round to defend herself from being turned into a punching bag. However, this only called for more torture from Conje who caught her off guard with vicious punches. Though Conje dominated, it was Mukami who kept fans at the edge of their seats with her resilient nature even though it was apparent she was losing. Achieng, who appeared rejuvenated and kept changing tactics and solidified her lead with heavy punches in the last round, which left her opponent gasping for breath and short of tricks.\" Mukami fell to 4-2 (0 KO's).\nOn 8 May 2009 at the Royal Event Center in Berlin, Germany, Conjestina Achieng fought to a 10-round draw (95-95,97-95,96-97) with Maria Lindberg of Malmo, Sweden for the vacant WIBF Middleweight title. According to a report by Per Ake Persson, it was a fast paced, not very clean fight in which Lindberg pressed the action and Achieng countered, but few telling punches were landed. Lindberg is now 2-0-2 as a pro boxer, while Achieng progressed to 15-6-5 (7 KO's). Lindberg is the 1998 Swedish amateur 71-kg champion who was suspended from boxing competition after an injury in 1999 but returned in 2003 to fight professionally.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBeing otherwise unemployed, Achieng, who normally earned about $250 a fight, relied on boxing to pay for her inexpensive one-room rented apartment in Nairobi's impoverished Lucky Summer estate. Her greatest challenge was to finance her training and maintain a well-balanced diet. In a country where many survive on less than $1 a day, Achieng struggled to put food on the table and meet her basic needs. Government support for training facilities and equipment is limited and reliable boxing promoters are rare, so prize money is hard to come by.\n\"I earn a living the hard way\", she said in an interview with Women Boxing Archive Network. \"I can't afford the right foods and sometimes I don't even have the bus fare to go for training. When I look at other boxers like Mike Tyson and Laila Ali, my soul bleeds. They are rich and the kind of life they lead is not comparable to ours. But us we lead a dog's life. Things don\u2019t fall on a silver plate. Every individual has to reap where he or she has sown and I am no exception.\"\n\"In Kenya, boxing is not well paying as people may think. I don\u2019t have a permanent salary and I\u2019m only paid when there is a fight and if I have won. Boxing is hard and should be treated with the seriousness it deserves. One has to be committed and train hard.\"\n\"I have a son and younger sisters who are still in school, and all of them depend on me. My aging parents can no longer afford to cater for these people and I\u2019m left in charge,\" she added.\nAchieng's day began at 5.30 a.m. with 15 km of road work, then at 8.30 am she resumed her normal gym training till midday. \"I enjoy boxing in the company of male boxers\", said Achieng. \"We train and share ideas.\"\nIn any spare time she volunteered at a nearby school assisting children through their assignments and marking their books. The school's owner, Jean Ikenga has always supported Achieng and sometimes paid her rent.\nWhen Conjestina was in school she excelled in arts and crafts, and still pursues drawing and painting. Some of her work is displayed at Upendo Nursery in Mathare North. She said that one of her aims is to nurture young and aspiring artists.\nShe also wanted to fight Laila Ali. \"I am training hard and hope to face her in the ring. She does not sound a threat to me and I long to fight her. I will decide on whether to continue boxing or stop only after I snatch that title from her.\" Her promoter Caleb Kuya, a Danish-based Kenyan, was equally confident but said \"Conje\" needs at least three more fights under her belt before she faces Ali, especially as she has boxed professionally only once outside Kenya. \"She will be much better if she fights out of the country to get the feel of away matches and even jeering from other fans,\" he said as he outlined plans for seeking sponsorships for a potential Achieng vs. Ali showdown.\n\n\n== Health issues ==\nIn January 2011, Conjestina's father sent an appeal to Kenyans to help him take her to hospital after her behaviour deteriorated from the norm. According to her father, Conjestina had removed her son from school, set ablaze to all her boxing gear and disposed of all the equipment from her gymnasium, which she had opened in 2009. She was admitted at the Mathari hospital in Nairobi which specialises in mental health care. She was later released.\nOn 4 September 2012. a story ran on Citizen TV showing Conjestina in a state of confusion and utter despair. The former boxer showed off her belts. She was said to be living in poverty having not paid her Ksh 2000 ($23) rent for 4 months. She was under the care of her younger sister. Conjestina was later taken to the Mathari Hospital by Ida Odinga. A popular campaign on social media raised enough money for her to move into a more comfortable dwelling. The comedian Daniel Ndambuk (Churchill) personally donated 180,000 s to pay her rent after public pressure reminded him of a promise he had made to support her.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of female boxers\nLuo people of Kenya and Tanzania\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nConjestina Achieng at Awakening Fighters\nWBAN Biography\nPresentation on boxrec.com",

Schneider, was an American civil engineer and bridge designer.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSchneider was born in Apolda in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. He graduated from the Royal Technical School at Chemnitz, Germany, in 1864, after which he worked as a mechanical engineer. He emigrated to the United States in 1867, where he worked for the Paterson Locomotive Works in New Jersey for four years before moving to Detroit to work for the Michigan Bridge and Construction Company. In 1875, he went to New York City to help review proposals for the Blackwell's Island Bridge across the East River (which would eventually be completed in 1909 and later came to be known as the Queensboro Bridge). While in New York, he met Charles Macdonald, and worked with him for the next year at the Delaware Bridge Company. In 1883 he started his own civil engineering business in New York City. In 1885 he submitted a proposal for a bridge across the Harlem River north of High Bridge; his design was selected and opened in 1889 as the Washington Bridge.\nHe was one of the engineers that were involved in the erection of the Statue of Liberty in 1886. Among the many bridges he designed and built are the cantilever Fraser River bridge on the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Niagara Cantilever Bridge. He was also involved in the 1906 construction of the Longteng Bridge in Taiwan, a development that was never finalized after its collapse from the 1935 Hsinchu earthquake. Schneider also was the head of the team investigating the first collapse of the Quebec Bridge in 1907, and in 1911 became a member of the board of engineers for the bridge.\nHe was vice president of the American Bridge Company from 1900-1903. In 1905 Schneider was named president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. He was twice awarded with the Norman Medal which \u201crecognizes a paper that makes a definitive contribution to engineering science,\u201d in 1905 and in 1908. About 1910 he ran an engineering office together with Frederick C. Kunz in Philadelphia.\n\n\n== Bridges and buildings ==\nNiagara Cantilever Bridge, Niagara Falls (New York) / Niagara Falls (Ontario), 1883\nCPR Bridge crossing the Fraser River at Cisco (Siska), 1884\nWashington Bridge, New York City, 1886\nRailway terminal, Jersey City, 1891\n\n\n== Writings ==\nGeneral Specifications for Railroad Bridges (1886)\nGeneral Specifications for Highway Bridges (1901)\nGeneral Specifications for Structural Steel Work in Buildings (1905; new ed., 1910)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGriggs, Jr., Frank (January 2011). \"Charles Conrad Schneider\".

            "content": "Azerbaijani (, , ) or Azeri (,  ), also referred to as Azeri Turkic or Azeri Turkish, is a Turkic language spoken primarily by the Azerbaijanis, who are concentrated mainly in Transcaucasia and Iranian Azerbaijan (historic Azerbaijan). The language has official status in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Dagestan (a federal subject of Russia) but it does not have official status in Iranian Azerbaijan, where the majority of Azerbaijanis live. It is also spoken to lesser varying degrees in Azerbaijani communities of Georgia and Turkey and by diaspora communities, primarily in Europe and North America.\nAzerbaijani is a member of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. It has two primary divisions, North Azerbaijani (spoken in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Russia, based on the Shirvani dialect) and South Azerbaijani (spoken in Iran, based on the Tabrizi dialect), and is closely related to Turkish, Qashqai, Turkmen and Crimean Tatar, sharing varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with each of those languages.\n\n\n== Etymology and background ==\nHistorically the language was referred to locally as T\u00fcrki meaning \"Turkic\" or Az\u0259rbaycan T\u00fcrkc\u0259si meaning \"Azerbaijani Turkish\" and scholars such as Vladimir Minorsky used this definition in their works, distinguishing it from \u0130stanbul T\u00fcrk\u00e7esi (\"Istanbul Turkish\"), the official language of Turkey. Modern literature in the Republic of Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iranian Azerbaijan region (historic Azerbaijan) it is based on the Tabrizi one.\nPrior to the establishment of the pan-Turkist Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, who adopted the name of \"Azerbaijan\" for political reasons in 1918, the name of \"Azerbaijan\" was exclusively used to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern Iran. After the establishment of the Azerbaijan SSR, on the order of Soviet leader Stalin, the \"formal language\" of the Azerbaijan SSR was \"changed from Turkish to Azeri\".\n\n\n== History and evolution ==\n\nAzerbaijani evolved from the Eastern branch of Oghuz Turkic (\"Western Turkic\") which spread to the Caucasus, in Eastern Europe, and northern Iran, in Western Asia, during the medieval Turkic migrations. Persian and Arabic influenced the language, but Arabic words were mainly transmitted through the intermediary of literary Persian. Azerbaijani is, perhaps after Uzbek, the Turkic language upon which Persian and other Iranian has exerted the strongest impact\u2014mainly in phonology, syntax and vocabulary, less in morphology.\nTurkic language of Azerbaijan gradually supplanted the Iranian languages in what is now northern Iran, and a variety of languages of the Caucasus and Iranian languages spoken in the Caucasus, particularly Udi and Old Azeri. By the beginning of the 16th century, it had become the dominant language of the region, and was a spoken language in the court of the Safavids and Afsharids.\nThe historical development of Azerbaijani can be divided into two major periods: early (c. 16th to 18th century) and modern (18th century to present). Early Azerbaijani differs from its descendant in that it contained a much larger number of Persian, and Arabic loanwords, phrases and syntactic elements. Early writings in Azerbaijani also demonstrate linguistic interchangeability between Oghuz and Kypchak elements in many aspects (such as pronouns, case endings, participles, etc.). As Azerbaijani gradually moved from being merely a language of epic and lyric poetry to being also a language of journalism and scientific research, its literary version has become more or less unified and simplified with the loss of many archaic Turkic elements, stilted Iranisms and Ottomanisms, and other words, expressions, and rules that failed to gain popularity among the Azerbaijani masses.\nBetween c. 1900 and 1930, there were several competing approaches to the unification of the national language in what is now the Azerbaijan Republic, popularized by the scholars such as Hasan bey Zardabi and Mammad agha Shahtakhtinski. Despite major differences, they all aimed primarily at making it easy for semi-literate masses to read and understand literature. They all criticized the overuse of Persian, Arabic, and European elements in both colloquial and literary language and called for a simpler and more popular style.\nThe Russian conquest of Transcaucasia in the 19th century split the language community across two states; the Soviet Union promoted development of the language, but set it back considerably with two successive script changes \u2013 from the Persian to Latin and then to the Cyrillic script \u2013 while Iranian Azerbaijanis continued to use the Persian script as they always had. Despite the wide use of Azerbaijani in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, it became the official language of Azerbaijan only in 1956. After independence, the Azerbaijan Republic decided to switch back to the Latin script.\n\n\n== Literature ==\n\nThe first examples of Azerbaijani literature date to the late 1200s following the Mongol conquest and were written in Arabic script. In the 1300s Kadi Burhan al-Din, Hesenoghlu, and Imadaddin Nasimi helped to establish Azerbaiijani as a language through poetry and other literary works. The ruler and poet Ismail I wrote under the pen name Khat\u0101'\u012b (which means \"sinner\" in Persian) during the fifteenth century During the 16th century, the poet, writer and thinker Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee wrote mainly in Azerbaijani but also translated his poems into Arabic and Persian.\nIn 1875 Akinchi (\u018fkin\u00e7i / \u0627\u06a9\u064a\u0646\u0686\u06cc\u200e ) (\"The Ploughman\") became the first Azerbaijani newspaper to be published in the Russian Empire. It was started by Hasan bey Zardabi, a journalist and education advocate. Starting in the 1830s several newspapers were published in Iran during the reign of the Azerbaijani speaking Qajar dynasty but it is unknown whether any of these newspapers were written in Azerbaijani.\nFollowing the rule of the Qajar dynasty Iran was ruled by Reza Shah who banned the publication of texts in Azerbaijani. Modern literature in the Republic of Azerbaijan is based on the Shirvani dialect mainly, while in Iranian Azerbaijan it is based on the Tabrizi dialect.\nMohammad-Hossein Shahriar is an important figure in Azerbaijani poetry. His most important work is Heydar Babaya Salam and it is considered to be a pinnacle of Azerbaijani literature and gained popularity in the Turkic-speaking world. It was translated into more than 30 languages.\nIn the mid-19th century Azerbaijani literature was taught at schools in Baku, Ganja, Shaki, Tbilisi, and Yerevan. Since 1845, it has also been taught in the Saint Petersburg State University in Russia. Today Azerbaijani language and literature programs are offered in the United States at several universities, including: Indiana University, UCLA, University of Michigan, University of Texas at Austin, and University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\n\n\n== Lingua franca ==\n\nAzerbaijani served as a lingua franca throughout most parts of Transcaucasia except the Black Sea coast, in southern Dagestan, the Eastern Anatolia Region and Iranian Azerbaijan from the 16th to the early 20th centuries, alongside the cultural, administrative, court literature, and most importantly official language of all these regions, namely Persian. From the early 16th century up to the course of the 19th century, these regions and territories were all ruled by the Iranian Safavids, Afsharids and Qajars until the cession of Transcaucasia proper and Dagestan by Qajar Iran to the Russian Empire per the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan and the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay. Per the 1829 Caucasus School Statute, Azerbaijani was to be taught in all district schools of Ganja, Shusha, Nukha (present-day Shaki), Shamakhi, Quba, Baku, Derbent, Yerevan, Nakhchivan, Akhaltsikhe, and Lankaran. Beginning in 1834, it was introduced as a language of study in Kutaisi instead of Armenian. In 1853, Azerbaijani became a compulsory language for students of all backgrounds in all of Transcaucasia with the exception of the Tiflis Governorate.\n\n\n== North vs. South Azerbaijani ==\n\nAzerbaijani is one of the Oghuz languages within the Turkic language family. Azerbaijani is classified by Ethnologue as a \"macrolanguage and North Azerbaijani (spoken mainly in the Republic of Azerbaijan and Russia) and South Azerbaijani (spoken in Iran, Iraq and Syria) are each classified as separate languages with \"significant differences in phonology, lexicon, morphology, syntax, and loanwords.\" The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) encodes North Azerbaijani and South Azerbaijani as distinct languages. Both languages also have dialects, with 21 North Azerbaijani dialects and 11 South Azerbaijani dialects.\nAlthough there is a very high degree of mutual intelligibility between both forms of Azerbaijani, there are also morphological and phonological differences. Four varieties have been accorded ISO 639-3 codes: North Azerbaijani, South Azerbaijani, Salchuq, and Qashqai. Glottolog, based on Johanson (2006) and Pakendorf (2007), classifies North Azerbaijani with Salchuq in one branch of the Oghuz languages and South Azerbaijani with Qashqai in another.\nAccording to the Linguasphere Observatory, all Oghuz languages form part of a single \"outer language\" of which North and South Azerbaijani are \"inner languages\".\n\n\n=== North Azerbaijani ===\n\nNorth Azerbaijani, or Northern Azerbaijani, is the official language of the Republic of Azerbaijan. It is closely related to the modern day Istanbul Turkish, the official language of Turkey. It is also spoken in southern Dagestan, along the Caspian coast in the southern Caucasus Mountains and in scattered regions throughout Central Asia. There are some 7.3 million first language speakers and about eight million second-language speakers.\nThe Shirvan dialect is the basis of standard Azerbaijani. Since 1992, it has been officially written with a Latin script in the Republic of Azerbaijan, but the older Cyrillic script was still widely used in the late 1990s.\nEthnologue lists 21 North Azerbaijani dialects: Quba, Derbend, Baku, Shamakhi, Salyan, Lenkaran, Qazakh, Airym, Borcala, Terekeme, Qyzylbash, Nukha, Zaqatala (Mugaly), Qabala, Yerevan, Nakhchivan, Ordubad, Ganja, Shusha (Karabakh), Karapapak.\n\n\n=== South Azerbaijani ===\nSouth Azerbaijani or Iranian Turkic, is widely spoken in Iranian Azerbaijan (historic Azerbaijan) and, to a lesser extent, in neighboring regions of Iraq and Turkey, with smaller communities in Syria. In Iran, the Persian word for Azerbaijani Turkic is borrowed as Torki \"Turkic\". In Iran, it is spoken in East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Zanjan, and parts of Kurdistan, Hamadan, Markazi, Qazvin and Gilan. It is also widely spoken in Tehran and across Tehran Province, as Turks form by far the largest minority in the city and the wider province, comprising about 25% to 1/3, of its total population. The CIA World Factbook reports in 2010 the percentage of South Azerbaijani speakers at around 16 percent of the Iranian population, or approximately 13 million people worldwide, and ethnic Turks form by far the second largest ethnic group in Iran, thus making the language also the second most spoken language in the nation.\nDialects of South Azerbaijani include: Aynallu (Inallu, Inanlu), Qarapapaq, Tabrizi, Qashqai, Afshari (Afsar, Afshar), Shahsavani (Shahseven), Muqaddam, Baharlu (Kamesh), Nafar, Qarag\u00f6zl\u00fc, Pishaqchi, Bayatlu, Qajar.\n\n\n== Azerbaijani vs. Turkish ==\n\nHistorically, Azerbaijani and Turkish speakers have been able to communicate with relative ease. One example of this is when Reza Shah Pahlavi of Iran (who spoke Azerbaijani) met with Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk of Turkey (who spoke Turkish) in 1934.\nSpeakers of Turkish and Azerbaijani can communicate with each other but both languages have substantial variation and mutual intelligibility is enhanced when Azerbaijani speakers have been exposed to Turkish television (e.g. Turkish soap operas) or when Turkish speakers have been exposed to Azerbaijani pop music. Most Azerbaijanis, however, are exposed to Turkish television, and, therefore, they tend to be better able to understand Turkish than vice versa. There are also numerous Turkish schools in the Republic of Azerbaijan that give students more exposure to Turkish than the average Turkish-speaker has to Azerbaijani.\nHere are some words with a different pronunciation in Azeri and Turkish that mean the same in both languages:\n\n\n== Phonology ==\n\n\n=== Consonants ===\n/t\u0361\u0283/ and /d\u0361\u0292/ are realised as [t\u0361s] and [d\u0361z] respectively in the areas around Tabriz and to the west, south and southwest of Tabriz (including Kirkuk in Iraq); in the Nakhchivan and Ayrum dialects, in C\u0259brayil and some Caspian coastal dialects;\nIn most dialects of Azerbaijani, /c/ is realized as [\u00e7] when it is found in the syllabic coda or is preceded by a voiceless consonant (as in \u00e7\u00f6r\u0259k [t\u0361\u0283\u0153\u02c8\u027e\u00e6\u00e7] \u2013 \"bread\"; s\u0259ks\u0259n [s\u00e6\u00e7\u02c8s\u00e6n] \u2013 \"eighty\").\n/k/ appears only in words borrowed from Russian or French (spelled, as with /c/, with a k).\n/w/ exists in the Kirkuk dialect as an allophone of /v/ in Arabic loanwords.\nIn the Baku dialect, /ov/ may be realised as [o\u028a], and /ev/ and /\u0153v/ as [\u0153y], e.g. /\u0261ovur\u02c8m\u0251/ \u2192 [\u0261o\u028ar\u02c8m\u0251], /sev\u02c8d\u0251/ \u2192 [s\u0153y\u02c8d\u0251], /d\u0153v\u02c8r\u0251n/ \u2192 [d\u0153y\u02c8r\u0251n], as well as with surnames ending in -ov or -ev (borrowed from Russian).\nIn colloquial speech, /x/ is usually pronounced as [\u03c7]\n\n\n=== Vowels ===\n\nThe vowels of the Azerbaijani are, in alphabetical order, a /\u0251/, e /e/, \u0259 /\u00e6/, \u0131 /\u026f/, i /i/, o /o/, \u00f6 /\u0153/, u /u/, \u00fc /y/. There are no diphthongs in Azerbaijani when two vowels come together; when that occurs in some Arabic loanwords, each vowel retains its individual sound.\nThe typical phonetic quality of Azeri vowels is as follows:\n/i, u, \u00e6/ are close to cardinal [i, u, a].\n/y/ is close near-front [y\u0320].\n/\u0153/ and /\u026f/ differ from one another mainly by rounding. Their quality is more or less close-mid central [\u0275, \u0258]. Phonologically however, they are more distinct: /\u0153/ is phonologically a mid front rounded vowel, the front counterpart of /o/. /\u026f/ is phonologically a close back unrounded vowel, the back counterpart of /i/.\nThe other mid vowels /e, o/ are closer to close-mid [e, o] than open-mid [\u025b, \u0254].\n/\u0251/ is phonetically near-open back [\u0251\u031d].\n\n\n== Writing systems ==\n\nBefore 1929, Azerbaijani was written only in the Persian version of the Arabic alphabet. In 1929\u20131938 a Latin alphabet was in use for North Azerbaijani (although it was different from the one used now), from 1938 to 1991 the Cyrillic script was used, and in 1991 the current Latin alphabet was introduced, although the transition to it has been rather slow. For instance, until an Aliyev decree on the matter in 2001, newspapers would routinely write headlines in the Latin script, leaving the stories in Cyrillic; the transition also resulted in some misrendering of \u0130 as \u00cc.\nIn Iran, Azerbaijani is still written in the Persian alphabet, and in Dagestan, in Cyrillic script.\nThe Perso-Arabic Azerbaijani alphabet is an abjad; that is, it does not represent vowels. Also, some consonants can be represented by more than one letter. The Azerbaijani Latin alphabet is based on the Turkish Latin alphabet because of their linguistic connections and mutual intelligibility. The letters \u04d8\u0259, Xx, and Qq are available only in Azerbaijani for sounds which do not exist as separate phonemes in Turkish.\nAzerbaijani Turkic also uses a, e, i, o and u with the macron:\n\u0101 for /\u0251\u02d0/\n\u0113 for /e\u02d0/\n\u012b for /i\u02d0/\n\u014d for /o\u02d0/\n\u016b for /u\u02d0/\nIn the case of length distinction, these letters are used for Arabic and Persian borrowings from the Islamic period, most of which have been eliminated from the language. Native Turkic words have no vowel length distinction, and for them the macron is used solely to indicate palatalization.\nThe Azerbaijani Turkic, when written in the Latin or Cyrillic script, transcribes any foreign names into Azerbaijani spelling, e.g. Bush becomes Bu\u015f and Schr\u00f6der becomes \u015er\u00f6der.\n\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n\n\n=== Interjections ===\nSome samples include:\nSecular:\nOf (\"Ugh!\")\nTez Ol (\"Come on\")\nTez olun q\u0131zlar m\u0259dr\u0259s\u0259y\u0259 (\"Girls to school!\", a slogan for an education campaign in Azerbaijan)\nInvoking deity:\nimplicitly:\nAman (\"Mercy\")\n\u00c7ox \u015f\u00fck\u00fcr (\"Much thanks\")\n\nexplicitly:\nAllah Allah (pronounced as Allahallah) (\"Goodness gracious\")\nHay Allah; Vallah \"By God [I swear it]\".\n\u00c7ox \u015f\u00fck\u00fcr allah\u0131m (\"Much thanks my god\")\n\n\n=== Formal and informal ===\nAzerbaijani has informal and formal ways of saying things. This is because there is more than one meaning to \"you\" in Turkic languages like Azerbaijani and Turkish (as well as in many other languages). The informal you is used when talking to close friends, relatives, animals or children. The formal you is used when talking to someone who is older than you or someone for whom you would like to show respect (a professor, for example).\nAs in many Romance languages, personal pronouns can be omitted, and they are only added for emphasis. Azerbaijani has a phonetic writing system, so pronunciation is easy: most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled in the modern Azerbaijani alphabet.\n\n\n=== Numbers ===\nFor numbers 11\u201319, the numbers literally mean \"10 one, 10 two\" and so on.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistorical linguistics\nLanguage family\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA blog on Azerbaijani language resources and translations\n(in Russian) A blog about the Azerbaijani language and lessons\nazeri.org, Azerbaijani literature and English translations.\nOnline bidirectional Azerbaijani-English Dictionary\nLearn Azerbaijani at learn101.org.\nPre-Islamic roots\nAzerbaijan-Turkish language in Iran by Ahmad Kasravi.\nincluding sound file.\nAzerbaijani<>Turkish dictionary (Pamukkale University)\nAzerbaijan Language with Audio\nAzerbaijani thematic vocabulary\nAzConvert, an open source Azerbaijani transliteration program.\nAzerbaijani Alphabet and Language in Transition, the entire issue of Azerbaijan International, Spring 2000 (8.1) at azer.com.\nEditorial\nChart: Four Alphabet Changes in Azerbaijan in the 20th century\nChart: Changes in the Four Azerbaijan Alphabet Sequence in the 20th century\nBaku\u2019s Institute of Manuscripts: Early Alphabets in Azerbaijan",

It was recorded at the Sydney Town Hall by one of the largest orchestras ever assembled in Australia for a film soundtrack recording largely comprising members (unofficially) of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.\nJeff Hall raved about the score in Film Music Bulletin,\nI was, in short, knocked out... If you love what the composer did for such films as the ROCKY series, THE RIGHT STUFF and ESCAPE TO VICTORY, you're going to lap this score up, as it's full of heroic and exciting music, lead by the triumphant main theme... Unquestionably one of the film music releases of the year.\nAndrew Keech was equally impressed in Music From the Movies,\nThe opening cue 'The Coolangatta Gold' is a glorious, stirring march that is an inspirational cross between the composer's fantastic theme for 'The Right Stuff' and Dvorak's 'New World'. This cue is full of pride and triumph, and is one of those cues that is an instant favourite\u2026 As the training intensifies and the film moves into the big race finale the music grows more like the big band, heavy beat music used in Rocky, increasing in power until breaking into the glorious orchestral 'Gold' theme once again for the 'Finale'. If that were not enough, most of the best cues receive a reprise, either in their LP versions or as alternative versions, in the eleven extra tracks included at the end of the album.\nFor fans of Bill Conti's work in the 1970s and 1980s this score is heaven, full of long exciting orchestral cues and dynamic big band exhilaration with every cue an absolute delight. A highly recommended score.\n\n\n== References ==",

She lived in Angagum\u00e9.\nOkinka Pampa succeeded her father Bankajapa as ruler of the island and keeper of its traditions around 1910, at a time when the government of Portugal was preparing to occupy the Bissagos archipelago as part of its territorial claims in Africa. She resisted their campaigns of pacification for some time before ultimately signing a peace treaty with them. At the same time, she implemented societal reforms that expanded the rights of women and ended slavery. Okinka Pampa died in 1930 of natural causes; her legacy is today still celebrated in the islands and on the mainland. She was the last queen of the Bijago people. Okinka Pampa is still worshiped throughout the archipelago, and her tomb may still be visited.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Dubgaill and Finngaill, or Dubgenti and Finngenti, are Middle Irish terms used to denote different rival groups of Vikings in Ireland and Britain. Literally, Dub-/Finngaill is translated as \"dark and fair foreigners\" or \"black and white foreigners\", and similarly, Dub-/Finngenti as \"dark/black\" and \"fair/white heathens\". Similar terms are found in Welsh chronicles, probably derived from Gaelic usage. The first known use of these terms in the chronicles is from 851, when it is noted that \"The Dubhghoill arrived in Ath Cliath [Dublin], and made a great slaughter of the Finnghoill\". The terms appear, with various spellings, in entries in Irish annals from the 9th and 10th century, and are also used and interpreted in later historiography.\nThere have been different interpretations of the terms. Traditionally, historians have speculated whether these distinctions refer to physical features such as skin or hair-colour, weaponry or outfits. Alfred P. Smyth suggested a new interpretation of dub and finn as \"new\" and \"old\". There is a long tradition of understanding Dubgaill as Danish Vikings and Finngaill as Norwegian Vikings. This interpretation has recently been challenged by David N. Dumville and Clare Downham, who, building on Smyth's conclusions, propose that the terms may not be related to ethnicity or origin of the different groups of Vikings.\nIn later times, centuries after the Norman invasion of Ireland, the Hiberno-Normans or so-called Old English (Ireland) were also referred to as Dubgaill and Finngaill.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word Gaill (plural of Gall) etymologically originates from \"Gauls\", who in pre-Viking Gaelic history were the archetypal \"foreigners\". Dumville says that \"what [the Gauls] had done in Gaelic prehistory to gain that status is unknown and was probably unpleasant.\" During the Viking age, it came to denote Scandinavians or those of Scandinavian descent or speech. From the Norman invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, this appellation was passed on to foreigners of French speech and then to the English at large. The word did not denote \"foreigner\" in the sense \"anyone not Irish (Gaelic)\", but the Saxons, Welsh and Picts are identified as such in the Irish annals, and there are also terms used which may identify the Scandinavians based on nationality, like Dene, Northmanni and Lochlainn.\nAnother word frequently used by the chroniclers in the early phase of the Viking age was Gen(n)ti, meaning \"foreigner of a different religion\". This was derived from the biblical usage of the Latin phrase gentes or gentiles, the latter form common in traditional English translations of the Bible. This terminology was abandoned, which has been taken as recognition of eventual conversion to Christianity.\nThe literary meaning of Old Irish and Old Welsh Dub is normally given as \"dark\" or \"black\", while Middle Irish finn (Old Irish find, Modern Irish fionn) is given as \"light\" or \"white\". Smyth, referring to the Dictionary of the Irish Language by the Royal Irish Academy, adds that Dub can mean \"gloomy\" or \"melancholy\" in a moral sense, and has the intensive meaning of \"great\" or \"mighty\". For finn there are the additional meanings of \"handsome\", \"just\" and \"true\".\n\n\n== Interpretation history ==\n\n\n=== The meaning of Finn- and Dub- ===\nHistorians have offered various explanations to account for the fact that terms associated with colour denote two separate factions of Vikings. The explanation which has been most widely accepted is that it either relates to hair-colour or armour. The view that it relates to colour was held, for instance, by the Danish antiquary Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae and James Henthorn Todd; but it also occurs in more modern historical works like in Mac Airt & Mac Niocaill's 1983 edition of Annals of Ulster where Fhinngallaibh is translated \"fair-haired foreigners\". According to Smyth, the most bizarre explanation of the terms was put forward by Jan de Vries. He suggested that the \"Black foreigners\" were Moorish slaves, carried off to Ireland in a Viking raid on North Africa.\nJ\u00f3n Steffensen, while rejecting the fair- and dark-haired hypothesis, suggested that the terms originated from the colours on the shields of the Vikings, the finngaill carrying white shields and the dubgaill red.\nAlfred Smyth gives arguments against all colour-related distinctions. Referring to Steffensen, he dismisses the assumption that \"any large Scandinavian host could be composed exclusively and over a long period of dark-haired individuals\" as being unrealistic. As an argument against Steffensen theory of shield-colour, as well as other theories based on colour of armour, he asserts that regular uniform and equipment were unknown in early medieval Germanic armies, and that \"Norwegian pirates could afford the luxury of carrying nothing but white shields is fanciful to the extreme\". As a final argument against distinction in colour between Viking factions, Smyth notes that even though these Vikings were active elsewhere, no Anglo-Saxon or Frankish chroniclers have mentioned any particular colour-distinction.\nSmyth concludes that in this context, finn and dub should not be related to colour or brightness, but must be translated as \"old\" and \"new\". He finds precedent for this in part on Mageoghagan's translations of the Annals of Clonmacnoise from the early 17th century, where Sihtric (Sigtrygg) C\u00e1ech in his epitaph is called \"prince of the new & old Danes\".\n\n\n=== Norwegians and Danes? ===\nThe identification of Finngaill as Norwegian and Dubgaill as Danish has had a long tradition, but it was first made long after the terms fell out of contemporary use. According to Smyth, the oldest Irish source that equates the Dub- with Danes is the 12th-century Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib, who speaks of \"Danish Black Gentiles\" (Duibgeinti Danarda). Downham points out that the last contemporary use of the terms may be Chronicon Scotorum sub anno 941. According to Smyth, medieval Irish writers and later Gaelic antiquaries such as Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh and Geoffrey Keating \"were clear on overall Norwegian origin of the Finn Gaill and the Danish origin of the Dub Gaill\". Smyth also states that \"it is clear from references to Scandinavian activity of the ninth and tenth century within Ireland that the 'White Foreigners' had a predominantly Norwegian origin, and that their opposite number were Danes\", without giving any further references for this conclusion.\nSmyth argued that Finn- and Dub- did not imply an ethnic distinction but rather \"old\" and \"new\", and also pointed out that \"large viking armies were not exclusively either Danish or Norwegian\". He still did not question the identification as Norwegian/Danish. Downham has pointed out that by the time the first sources equating these terms with Norwegian/Danish were written down, changes in Scandinavia had made the Irish aware of a distinction between Norwegians and Danes, a distinction the Irish (or for that matter the \"Norwegian\" or \"Danes\") would not have been aware of in the middle of the 9th century. Downham argues that a \"new interpretation was interposed on the earlier terms 'Fair Foreigner' and 'Dark Foreigner'\".\nDownham, with reference to a suggestion made by Dumville, offers the alternative interpretation that finngaill and dubgaill identified Viking groups under different leadership. The dubgaill may identify Vikings under the leadership of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair, while the finngaill were those \"old\" Vikings present in Ireland before the middle of the 9th century. The rivalry between the U\u00ed \u00cdmair and other groups persisted long after the U\u00ed \u00cdmair had gained control over Dublin, and their hegemony over the Viking settlements in Ireland was established when Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid defeated the Vikings of Limerick. After the death of \u00c1mlaib, the label finngaill fell out of contemporary use in Irish chronicles.\n\n\n== Imperial style ==\nThe style King of the Dubgaill and Finngaill (or vice versa) was an imperial one held only by three or four dynasts of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair.\nRagnall ua \u00cdmair, the first\nSitric C\u00e1ech, the most celebrated\n(Gofraid ua \u00cdmair), styled simply R\u00ed Gall (King of the Foreigners) in the surviving sources\nAmla\u00edb mac Gofraid, his son and the last, styled also King of Ireland in Anglo-Saxon sources\n\n\n== See also ==\nIrish nobility\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nAnnals of Innisfallen, CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts, 2000, retrieved 19 March 2010 \nAnnals of the Four Masters, CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts, 2002, retrieved 19 March 2010 \nAnnals of Ulster AD 431\u20131201, CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts, 2003, retrieved 19 March 2010 \nChronicon Scotorum, CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts, 2003, retrieved 19 March 2010 \nByrne, Francis John (2001). 2, ed.

            "content": "The Heaf test, a diagnostic skin test, was long performed to determine whether or not children had been exposed to tuberculosis infection. The test was named after F. R. G. Heaf. Also known as the Sterneedle test, it was administered by a Heaf gun (trademarked \"Sterneedle\"), a spring-loaded instrument with six needles arranged in a circular formation.\nThe Heaf test was discontinued in 2005 because the manufacturer deemed its production to be financially unsustainable after manufacturers could not be found for tuberculin or Heaf guns. Until 2005, the test was used in the United Kingdom to determine if the BCG vaccine was needed; the Mantoux test is now used instead. The Heaf test was preferred in the UK, because it was thought to be easier to interpret, with less variability between observers, and less training was required to administer and read the test.\nPatients who exhibited a negative reaction to the test were considered for BCG vaccination.\nThe Heaf test was used to test for tuberculosis in adolescents aged around 13\u201314.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nA Heaf gun was used to inject multiple samples of testing serum under the skin at once. The needle points were dipped in tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and pricked into the skin. A Heaf gun with disposable single-use heads was recommended.\nThe gun injected PPD equivalent to 100,000 units per ml to the skin over the flexor surface of the left forearm in a circular pattern of six. The test was read between two and seven days later. The injection could not be into sites containing superficial veins.\nThe reading of the Heaf test was defined by a scale:\nNegative - No induration, maybe six minute puncture scars\nGrade 1 - four to six papules (also considered negative)\nGrade 2 - Confluent papules form indurated ring (positive)\nGrade 3 - Central filling to form disc (positive)\nGrade 4 - Disc >10 mm with or without blistering (strongly positive)\nGrades 1 and 2 could result from previous BCG or avian tuberculosis, rather than human TB infection.\nChildren who were found to have a grade 3 or 4 reaction were referred for X-ray and follow-up.\nFor interpretation of the test, see Tuberculosis diagnosis.\n\n\n== Other tests ==\nThe equivalent Mantoux test positive levels done with 10 TU (0.1 mL 100 TU/mL, 1:1000) are\n0\u20134 mm induration (Heaf 0-1)\n5\u201314 mm induration (Heaf 2)\n>15 mm induration (Heaf 3-4)\nThe Mantoux test is preferred in the United States for the diagnosis of tuberculosis; multiple puncture tests, such as the Heaf test and Tine test, are not recommended.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Hepatocellular adenoma (also known as hepatic adenoma or hepadenoma) is a rare, benign liver tumor. It most commonly occurs in people with elevated systemic levels of estrogen, classically in women taking estrogen-containing oral contraceptive medication.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nAbout 25\u201350% of hepatic adenomas cause pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastric region of the abdomen. Since hepatic adenomas can be large (8\u201315 cm), patients may notice a palpable mass. However, hepatic adenomas are usually asymptomatic, and may be discovered incidentally on imaging ordered for some unrelated reason. Large hepatic adenomas have a tendency to rupture and bleed massively inside the abdomen. If not treated, there is a 30% risk of bleeding. Bleeding may lead to hypotension, tachycardia, and sweating (diaphoresis).\n\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nThe majority of hepatic adenomas arise in women aged 20\u201340, most of whom use oral contraceptives. Other medications which also alter circulating hormone levels, such as anabolic or androgenic steroids, barbituates, clomifene, have also been implicated as risk factors.\nIncidence of adenomas may be increased in metabolic diseases, including tyrosinemia and type 1 diabetes mellitus, and glycogen storage diseases (types 1 and 3), as well as in beta-thalassemia and hemochromatosis.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nHepatic adenoma is usually detected by imaging, typically an ultrasound or CT, as a hyperenhancing liver nodule. Given that several liver tumors appear similarly on these imaging modalities, a multi-phase contrast-enhanced imaging study such as CT or MRI may be used to provide more information. The significance of making a specific diagnosis is that, unlike other benign liver tumors such as hemangioma and focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenomas have a small but meaningful risk of progressing into a malignancy. Although imaging provides supportive information, a definitive diagnosis of hepatic adenoma requires biopsy of the tissue.\n\n\n=== Radiologic differential diagnosis ===\nEchinococcal cyst\nFocal fatty change\nFocal nodular hyperplasia\nHepatoblastoma\nInfiltrative liver disease\nInflammatory pseudotumor\nLeiomyosarcoma\nLymphoma\nNodular regenerative hyperplasia\n\n\n=== Subtypes ===\nHepatic adenomas may be classified by their morphologic and underlying genetic mutations.\nInflammatory (40%\u201350%)\nHNF1\u03b1-inactivated (35%\u201340%)\n\u03b2-catenin\u2013activated - with exon 3 versus exon 7/8 mutation\n\u03b2-Catenin\u2013activated inflammatory - with exon 3 versus exon 7/8 mutation\nSonic hedgehog activated\nUnclassified\n\n\n=== Pathologic diagnosis ===\n\nHepatic adenomas are, typically, well-circumscribed nodules that consist of sheets of hepatocytes with a bubbly vacuolated cytoplasm. The hepatocytes are on a regular reticulin scaffold and less or equal to three cell thick.\nThe histologic diagnosis of hepatic adenomas can be aided by reticulin staining. In hepatic adenomas, the reticulin scaffold is preserved and hepatocytes do not form layers of four or more hepatocytes, as is seen in hepatocellular carcinoma.\nCells resemble normal hepatocytes and are traversed by blood vessels but lack portal tracts or central veins.\n\n\n== Related Conditions ==\nHepatic adenomas are related to glycogen storage diseases, type 1, as well as anabolic steroid use.\n\n\n== Treatment ==\nSome authors feel that all hepatocellular adenoma should be resected, because of the risk of rupture causing bleeding and because they may contain malignant cells. Current recommendations are that all hepatic adenomas should be resected, as long as they are surgically accessible and the patient is a reasonable operative candidate. Patients with adenomas should avoid oral contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapy.\nPregnancy could cause the adenoma to grow faster, so patients with hepatic adenomas should avoid pregnancy.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversity of Utah\u2014Pathology Images",

            "content": "The rotary engine was an early type of internal combustion engine, usually designed with an odd number of cylinders per row in a radial configuration, in which the crankshaft remained stationary in operation, with the entire crankcase and its attached cylinders rotating around it as a unit. Its main application was in aviation, although it also saw use before its primary aviation role, in a few early motorcycles and automobiles.\nThis type of engine was widely used as an alternative to conventional inline engines (straight or V) during World War I and the years immediately preceding that conflict. It has been described as \"a very efficient solution to the problems of power output, weight, and reliability\".\nBy the early 1920s, the inherent limitations of this type of engine had rendered it obsolete.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Distinction between \"rotary\" and \"radial\" engines ===\nA rotary engine is essentially a standard Otto cycle engine, with cylinders arranged radially around a central crankshaft just like a conventional radial engine, but instead of having a fixed cylinder block with rotating crankshaft as with a radial engine, the crankshaft remains stationary and the entire cylinder block rotates around it. In the most common form, the crankshaft was fixed solidly to the airframe, and the propeller was simply bolted to the front of the crankcase.\n\nThis difference also has much impact on design (lubrication, ignition, fuel admission, cooling, etc.) and functioning (see below).\nThe Musee de l'Air in Paris has on display a special, \"sectioned\" working model of an engine with seven \"radially disposed\" cylinders. It alternates between \"rotary\" and \"radial\" modes to demonstrate the difference between the internal motions of the two types of engine.\n\n\n=== Arrangement ===\nLike radial engines, rotaries were generally built with an odd number of cylinders (usually 5, 7 or 9), so that a consistent every-other-piston firing order could be maintained, to provide smooth running. Rotary engines with an even number of cylinders were mostly of the \"two row\" type.\nMost rotary engines were arranged with the cylinders pointing outwards from a single crankshaft, in the same general form as a radial, but there were also rotary boxer engines and even one-cylinder rotaries.\n\n\n=== Advantages and drawbacks ===\nThree key factors contributed to the rotary engine's success at the time:\nSmooth running: Rotaries delivered power very smoothly because (relative to the engine mounting point) there are no reciprocating parts, and the relatively large rotating mass of the crankcase/cylinders (as a unit) acted as a flywheel.\nImproved cooling: when the engine was running the rotating crankcase/cylinder assembly created its own fast-moving cooling airflow, even with the aircraft at rest.\nWeight advantage: many conventional engines had to have heavy flywheels added to smooth out power impulses and reduce vibration. Rotary engines gained a substantial power-to-weight ratio advantage by having no need for an added flywheel. They shared with other radial configuration engines the advantage of a small, flat crankcase, and because of their efficient air-cooling system cylinders could be made with thinner walls and shallower cooling fins, which further reduced their weight.\nEngine designers had always been aware of the many limitations of the rotary engine so when the static style engines became more reliable and gave better specific weights and fuel consumption, the days of the rotary engine were numbered.\nRotary engines had a fundamentally inefficient total-loss oiling system. In order to reach the whole engine the lubricating medium needed to enter the crankcase through the hollow crankshaft; but the centrifugal force of the revolving crankcase was directly opposed to any re-circulation. The only practical solution was for the lubricant to be aspirated with the fuel/air mixture, as in a two-stroke engine.\nPower increase also came with mass and size increases, multiplying gyroscopic precession from the rotating mass of the engine. This produced stability and control problems in aircraft in which these engines were installed, especially for inexperienced pilots.\nPower output increasingly went into overcoming the air-resistance of the spinning engine.\nEngine controls were tricky (see below), and resulted in fuel waste.\nThe late WWI Bentley BR2, as the largest and most powerful rotary engine, had reached a point beyond which this type of engine could not be further developed, and it was the last of its kind to be adopted into RAF service.\n\n\n== Rotary engine control ==\n\n\n=== Monosoupape rotaries ===\nIt is often asserted that rotary engines had no throttle and hence power could only be reduced by intermittently cutting the ignition using a \"blip\" switch. This was almost literally true of the \"Monosoupape\" (single valve) type, which took most of the air into the cylinder through the exhaust valve, which remained open for a portion of the downstroke of the piston. Thus the richness of the mixture in the cylinder could not be controlled via the crankcase intake. The \"throttle\" (fuel valve) of a monosoupape provided only a very limited degree of speed regulation, as opening it made the mixture too rich, while closing it made it too lean (in either case quickly stalling the engine, or damaging the cylinders). Early models featured a pioneering form of variable valve timing in an attempt to give greater control, but this caused the valves to burn and therefore it was abandoned.\nThe only way of running a Monosoupape engine smoothly at reduced revs was with a switch that changed the normal firing sequence so that each cylinder fired only once per two or three engine revolutions, but the engine remained more or less in balance. As with excessive use of the \"blip\" switch: running the engine on such a setting for too long resulted in large quantities of unburned fuel and oil in the exhaust, and gathering in the lower cowling, where it was a notorious fire hazard.\n\n\n=== \"Normal\" rotaries ===\nMost rotaries had normal inlet valves, so that the fuel (and lubricating oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine. Although a conventional carburetor, with the ability to keep the fuel/air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings, was precluded by the spinning crankcase; it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or \"bloctube\". The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate \"fine adjustment\" lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual choke control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle, the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.\nThrottling a running engine back to reduce revs was possible by closing off the fuel valve to the required position while re-adjusting the fuel/air mixture to suit. This process was also tricky, so that throttling back, especially when landing, was often accomplished by intermittently cutting the ignition using the blip switch.\nCutting cylinders using ignition switches had the drawback of letting fuel continue to pass through the engine, oiling up the spark plugs and making smooth restarting problematic. Also, the raw oil-fuel mix could collect in the cowling. As this could cause a serious fire when the switch was released, it became common practice for part or all of the bottom of the basically circular cowling on most rotary engines to be cut away, or fitted with drainage slots.\nBy 1918 a Clerget handbook advised maintaining all necessary control by using the fuel and air controls, and starting and stopping the engine by turning the fuel on and off. The recommended landing procedure involved shutting off the fuel using the fuel lever, while leaving the blip switch on. The windmilling propeller made the engine continue to spin without delivering any power as the aircraft descended. It was important to leave the ignition on to allow the spark plugs to continue to spark and keep them from oiling up, so that the engine could (if all went well) be restarted simply by re-opening the fuel valve. Pilots were advised to not use an ignition cut out switch, as it would eventually damage the engine.\nPilots of surviving or reproduction aircraft fitted with rotary engines still find that the blip switch is useful while landing, as it provides a more reliable, quicker way to initiate power if needed, rather than risk a sudden engine stall, or the failure of a windmilling engine to restart at the worst possible moment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Millet ===\n\nF\u00e9lix Millet showed a 5-cylinder rotary engine built into a bicycle wheel at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889. Millet had patented the engine in 1888, so must be considered the pioneer of the internal combustion rotary engine. A machine powered by his engine took part in the Paris-Bordeaux-Paris race of 1895 and the system was put into production by Darracq and Company London in 1900.\n\n\n=== Hargrave ===\nLawrence Hargrave first developed a rotary engine in 1889 using compressed air, intending to use it in powered flight. Materials weight and lack of quality machining prevented it becoming an effective power unit.\n\n\n=== Balzer ===\nStephen M. Balzer of New York, a former watchmaker, constructed rotary engines in the 1890s. He was interested in the rotary layout for two main reasons:\nTo generate 100 hp (75 kW) at the low rpm at which the engines of the day ran, the pulse resulting from each combustion stroke was quite large. To damp out these pulses, engines needed a large flywheel, which added weight. In the rotary design the engine acted as its own flywheel, thus rotaries could be lighter than similarly sized conventional engines.\nThe cylinders had good cooling airflow over them, even when the aircraft was at rest\u2014which was important, as the low airspeed of aircraft of the time provided limited cooling airflow, and alloys of the day were less advanced. Balzer's early designs even dispensed with cooling fins, though subsequent rotaries did have this common feature of air-cooled engines.\nBalzer produced a 3-cylinder, rotary engined car in 1894, then later became involved in Langley's Aerodrome attempts, which bankrupted him while he tried to make much larger versions of his engines. Balzer's rotary engine was later converted to static radial operation by Langley's assistant, Charles M. Manly, creating the notable Manly-Balzer engine.\n\n\n=== De Dion-Bouton ===\nThe famous De Dion-Bouton company produced an experimental 4-cylinder rotary engine in 1899. Though intended for aviation use, it was not fitted to any aircraft.\n\n\n=== Adams-Farwell ===\n\nThe Adams-Farwell firm's automobiles, with the firm's first rolling prototypes using 3-cylinder rotary engines designed by Fay Oliver Farwell in 1898, led to production Adams-Farwell cars with first the 3-cylinder, then very shortly thereafter 5-cylinder rotary engines later in 1906, as another early American automaker utilizing rotary engines expressly manufactured for automotive use. Emil Berliner sponsored its development of the 5-cylinder Adams-Farwell rotary engine design concept as a lightweight power unit for his unsuccessful helicopter experiments. Adams-Farwell engines later powered fixed-wing aircraft in the US after 1910. It has also been asserted that the Gn\u00f4me design was derived from the Adams-Farwell, since an Adams-Farwell car is reported to have been demonstrated to the French Army in 1904. In contrast to the later Gn\u00f4me engines, and much like the later Clerget 9B and Bentley BR1 aviation rotaries, the Adams-Farwell rotaries had conventional exhaust and inlet valves mounted in the cylinder heads.\n\n\n=== Gnome ===\n\nThe Gnome engine was the work of the three Seguin brothers, Louis, Laurent and Augustin. They were talented engineers and the grandsons of famous French engineer Marc Seguin. In 1906 the eldest brother, Louis, had formed the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Moteurs Gnome to build stationary engines for industrial use, having licensed production of the Gnom single-cylinder stationary engine from Motorenfabrik Oberursel\u2014who, in turn, built licensed Gnome engines for German aircraft during World War I.\nLouis was joined by his brother Laurent who designed a rotary engine specifically for aircraft use, using Gnom engine cylinders. The brothers' first experimental engine is said to have been a 5-cylinder model that developed 34 hp (25 kW), and was a radial rather than rotary engine, but no photographs survive of the five-cylinder experimental model. The Seguin brothers then turned to rotary engines in the interests of better cooling, and the world's first production rotary engine, the 7-cylinder, air-cooled 50 hp (37 kW) \"Omega\" was shown at the 1908 Paris automobile show. The first Gnome Omega built still exists, and is now in the collection of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. The Seguins used the highest strength material available - recently developed nickel steel alloy - and kept the weight down by machining components from solid metal, using the best American and German machine tools to create the engine's components; the cylinder wall of a 50 hp Gnome was only 1.5 mm (0.059 inches) thick, while the connecting rods were milled with deep central channels to reduce weight. While somewhat low powered in terms of units of power per litre, its power-to-weight ratio was an outstanding 1 hp (0.75 kW) per kg.\nThe following year, 1909, the inventor Roger Ravaud fitted one to his A\u00e9roscaphe, a combination hydrofoil/aircraft, which he entered in the motor boat and aviation contests at Monaco. Henry Farman's use of the Gnome at the famous Rheims aircraft meet that year brought it to prominence, when he won the Grand Prix for the greatest non-stop distance flown\u2014180 kilometres (110 mi)\u2014and also set a world record for endurance flight. The very first successful seaplane flight, of Henri Fabre's Le Canard, was powered by a Gnome Omega on March 28, 1910 near Marseille.\nProduction of Gnome rotaries increased rapidly, with some 4,000 being produced before World War I, and Gnome also produced a two-row version (the 100 h.p. Double Omega), the larger 80 hp Gnome Lambda and the 160 hp two-row Double Lambda. By the standards of other engines of the period, the Gnome was considered not particularly temperamental, and was credited as the first engine able to run for ten hours between overhauls.\nIn 1913 the Seguin brothers introduced the new Monosoupape (\"single valve\") series, which replaced inlet valves in the pistons by using a single valve in each cylinder head, which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve. The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers, a system later abandoned due to valves burning. The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two-valve engines, and it used less lubricating oil. The 100 hp Monosoupape was built with 9 cylinders, and developed its rated power at 1,200 rpm. The later 160 hp nine-cylinder Gnome 9N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design, and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format.\n\nRotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rh\u00f4ne companies used conventional pushrod-operated valves in the cylinder head, but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft, with the Le Rh\u00f4nes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase to the top of each cylinder to admit the intake charge.\nThe 80 hp (60 kW) seven-cylinder Gnome was the standard at the outbreak of World War I, as the Gnome Lambda, and it quickly found itself being used in a large number of aircraft designs. It was so good that it was licensed by a number of companies, including the German Motorenfabrik Oberursel firm who designed the original Gnom engine. Oberursel was later purchased by Fokker, whose 80 hp Gnome Lambda copy was known as the Oberursel U.0. It was not at all uncommon for French Gnomes, as used in the earliest examples of the Bristol Scout biplane, to meet German versions, powering Fokker E.I Eindeckers, in combat, from the latter half of 1915 on.\nThe only attempts to produce twin-row rotary engines in any volume were undertaken by Gnome, with their Double Lambda fourteen-cylinder 160 hp design, and with the German Oberursel firm's early World War I clone of the Double Lambda design, the U.III of the same power rating. While an example of the Double Lambda went on to power one of the Deperdussin Monocoque racing aircraft to a world-record speed of nearly 204 km/h (126 mph) in September 1913, the Oberursel U.III is only known to have been fitted into a few German production military aircraft, the Fokker E.IV fighter monoplane and Fokker D.III fighter biplane, both of whose failures to become successful combat types were partially due to the poor quality of the German powerplant, which was prone to wearing out after only a few hours of combat flight.\n\n\n== World War I ==\n\nThe favourable power-to-weight ratio of the rotaries was their greatest advantage. While larger, heavier aircraft relied almost exclusively on conventional in-line engines, many fighter aircraft designers preferred rotaries right up to the end of the war.\nRotaries had a number of disadvantages, notably very high fuel consumption, partially because the engine was typically run at full throttle, and also because the valve timing was often less than ideal. Oil consumption was also very high. Due to primitive carburetion and absence of a true sump, the lubricating oil was added to the fuel/air mixture. This made engine fumes heavy with smoke from partially burnt oil. Castor oil was the lubricant of choice, as its lubrication properties were unaffected by the presence of the fuel, and its gum-forming tendency was irrelevant in a total-loss lubrication system. An unfortunate side-effect was that World War I pilots inhaled and swallowed a considerable amount of the oil during flight, leading to persistent diarrhoea. Flying clothing worn by rotary engine pilots was routinely soaked with oil.\nThe rotating mass of the engine also made it, in effect, a large gyroscope. During level flight the effect was not especially apparent, but when turning the gyroscopic precession became noticeable. Due to the direction of the engine's rotation, left turns required effort and happened relatively slowly, combined with a tendency to nose up, while right turns were almost instantaneous, with a tendency for the nose to drop. In some aircraft, this could be advantageous in situations such as dogfights. The Sopwith Camel suffered to such an extent that it required left rudder for both left and right turns, and could be extremely hazardous if the pilot applied full power at the top of a loop at low airspeeds. Trainee Camel pilots were warned to attempt their first hard right turns only at altitudes above 1,000 ft (300 m). The Camel's most famous German foe, the Fokker Dr.I triplane, also used a rotary engine, usually the Oberursel Ur.II clone of the French-built Le Rhone 9J 110 hp powerplant.\nEven before the First World War, attempts were made to overcome the inertia problem of rotary engines. As early as 1906 Charles Benjamin Redrup had demonstrated to the Royal Flying Corps at Hendon a 'Reactionless' engine in which the crankshaft rotated in one direction and the cylinder block in the opposite direction, each one driving a propeller. A later development of this was the 1914 reactionless 'Hart' engine designed by Redrup in which there was only one propeller connected to the crankshaft, but it rotated in the opposite direction to the cylinder block, thereby largely cancelling out negative effects. This proved too complicated for reliable operation and Redrup changed the design to a static radial engine, which was later tried in the experimental Vickers F.B.12b and F.B.16 aircraft, unfortunately without success.\nAs the war progressed, aircraft designers demanded ever-increasing amounts of power. Inline engines were able to meet this demand by improving their upper rev limits, which meant more power. Improvements in valve timing, ignition systems, and lightweight materials made these higher revs possible, and by the end of the war the average engine had increased from 1,200 rpm to 2,000. The rotary was not able to do the same due to the drag of the rotating cylinders through the air. For instance, if an early-war model of 1,200 rpm increased its revs to only 1,400, the drag on the cylinders increased 36%, as air drag increases with the square of velocity. At lower rpm, drag could simply be ignored, but as the rev count rose, the rotary was putting more and more power into spinning the engine, with less remaining to provide useful thrust through the propeller.\n\nOne clever attempt to rescue the design, in a similar manner to Redrup's British \"reactionless\" engine concept, was made by Siemens AG. The crankcase (with the propeller still fastened directly to the front of it) and cylinders spun counterclockwise at 900 rpm, as seen externally from a \"nose on\" viewpoint, while the crankshaft and other internal parts spun clockwise at the same speed, so the set was effectively running at 1800 rpm. This was achieved by the use of bevel gearing at the rear of the crankcase, resulting in the eleven-cylindered Siemens-Halske Sh.III, with less drag and less net torque. Used on several late war types, notably the Siemens-Schuckert D.IV fighter, the new engine\u2019s low running speed, coupled with large, coarse pitched propellers that sometimes had four blades (as the SSW D.IV used), gave types powered by it outstanding rates of climb, with some examples of the late production Sh.IIIa powerplant even said to be delivering as much as 240 hp.\nOne new rotary powered aircraft, Fokker's own D.VIII, was designed at least in part to provide some use for the Oberursel factory's backlog of otherwise redundant 110 hp (82 kW) Ur.II engines, themselves clones of the Le Rh\u00f4ne 9J rotary.\nBecause of the Allied blockade of shipping, the Germans were increasingly unable to obtain the castor oil necessary to properly lubricate their rotary engines. Substitutes were never entirely satisfactory - causing increased running temperatures and reduced engine life.\n\n\n== Postwar ==\nBy the time the war ended, the rotary engine had become obsolete, and it disappeared from use quite quickly. The British Royal Air Force probably used rotary engines for longer than most other operators. The RAF's standard post-war fighter, the Sopwith Snipe, used the Bentley BR2 rotary as the most powerful (at some 230 hp (170 kW)) rotary engine ever built by the Allies of World War I. The standard RAF training aircraft of the early post-war years, the 1914-origin Avro 504K, had a universal mounting to allow the use of several different types of low powered rotary, of which there was a large surplus supply. Similarly, the Swedish FVM \u00d61 Tummelisa advanced training aircraft, fitted with a Le-Rhone-Thulin 90 hp (67 kW) rotary engine, served until the mid thirties.\nDesigners had to balance the cheapness of war-surplus engines against their poor fuel efficiency and the operating expense of their total-loss lubrication system, and by the mid-1920s, rotaries had been more or less completely displaced even in British service, largely by the new generation of air-cooled \"stationary\" radials such as the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar and Bristol Jupiter.\nExperiments with the concept of the rotary engine continued.\nThe first version of the 1921 Michel engine, an unusual opposed-piston cam engine, used the principle of a rotary engine, in that its \"cylinder block\" rotated. This was soon replaced by a version with the same cylinders and cam, but with stationary cylinders and the cam track rotating in lieu of a crankshaft. A later version abandoned the cam altogether and used three coupled crankshafts.\nBy 1930 the Soviet helicopter pioneers, Boris N. Yuriev and Alexei M. Cheremukhin, both employed by Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut (TsAGI, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute), constructed one of the first practical single-lift rotor machines with their TsAGI 1-EA single rotor helicopter, powered by two Soviet-designed and built M-2 rotary engines, themselves up-rated copies of the Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine of World War I. The TsAGI 1-EA set an unofficial altitude record of 605 meters (1,985 ft) with Cheremukhin piloting it on 14 August 1932 on the power of its twinned M-2 rotary engines.\n\n\n== Use in cars and motorcycles ==\nAlthough rotary engines were mostly used in aircraft, a few cars and motorcycles were built with rotary engines. Perhaps the first was the Millet motorcycle of 1892. A famous motorcycle, winning many races, was the Megola, which had a rotary engine inside the front wheel. Another motorcycle with a rotary engine was Charles Redrup's 1912 Redrup Radial, which was a three-cylinder 303 cc rotary engine fitted to a number of motorcycles by Redrup.\nIn 1904 the Barry engine, also designed by Redrup, was built in Wales: a rotating 2-cylinder boxer engine weighing 6.5 kg was mounted inside a motorcycle frame.\nIn the 1940s Cyril Pullin developed the Powerwheel, a wheel with a rotating one-cylinder engine, clutch and drum brake inside the hub, but it never entered production.\nCars with rotary engines were built by American companies Adams-Farwell, Bailey, Balzer and Intrepid, amongst others.\n\n\n== Other rotary engines ==\nBesides the configuration of cylinders moving around a fixed crankshaft, several different engine designs are also called rotary engines. The most notable pistonless rotary engine, the Wankel rotary engine has been used by NSU in the Ro80 car, by Mazda in a variety of cars such as the RX-series, and in some experimental aviation applications.\nIn the late 1970s a concept engine called the Bricklin-Turner Rotary Vee was tested. The Rotary Vee is similar in configuration to the elbow steam engine. Piston pairs connect as solid V shaped members, with each end floating in a pair of rotating cylinders clusters. The rotating cylinder cluster pairs are set with their axes at a wide V angle. The pistons in each cylinder cluster move parallel to each other instead of a radial direction, This engine design has not gone into production. The Rotary Vee was intended to power the Bricklin SV-1.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPetrol engine\nMonosoupape engine\nManly-Balzer engine\nNutating disc engine\nQuasiturbine\nTurbine\nWankel rotary engine\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nParis Musee de l'Air combination of \"rotary\" and \"radial\" engine-function kinetic display\nSmithsonian NASM Gn\u00f4me Omega No.1 page\nSmithsonian NASM Le Rh\u00f4ne 9J page\nAnimation of Gnome Rotary in action\nRay Williams' operable miniature rotary engine website\nA rotary engine that runs solely on compressed air\nCharles Redrup's range of engines\nVideo of 1909 Gnome Omega Engine - Run April 2009\nBricklin-Turner Rotary Vee Engine\nBi-rotary engine from Franky Devaere",

In the 1930s Pierre Debroutelle, one of its engineers, invented one of the first prototypes of inflatable boats for the A\u00e9ronavale, who were looking for innovative and easy solution for military transport. This change from air to sea brought worldwide recognition to Zodiac. In the 1960s, the company turned to the leisure industry to accommodate the \u201cvacationers\u201d and their growing interest in recreational boating. With a history of unrivalled experience, Zodiac Nautic\u2019s origin is closely tied to all major innovations in the sector of inflatable boats.\nIn financial trouble, the company was sold to private owners in 2015.\n\n\n== Zodiac boat ==\nMade with an inflatable buoyancy tube and a rigid hull, these boats combine the advantages of traditional inflatable boats \u2013 security, stability, portability, and ease of use \u2013 with those of rigid-hulled boats \u2013 comfort, agility and speed.\nIts unique combination of a very low center of gravity, a deep-V hull and added stabilization of the tubes which gives the rigid hulled inflatable speed and sea-crossing capacities without compromising comfort or safety.\nThe Zodiac boat has an exceptional weight / area-below-water ratio, giving the boat a load-bearing capacity such that it can carry considerable loads.\nThe buoyancy is distributed on the sides, the center of gravity is very low: this makes it much harder to capsize the vessel.\nThe buoyancy tubes of Zodiac boats have several compartments, separated by waterproof partitions. Thanks to its important air reserves, the boat keeps its ability to float and stays conceptually unsinkable when fully loaded, even with a deflated compartment.\nZodiac inflatable boats are commonly used by the United States Military, however, these are Zodiac Milpro (Military and Professional) boats, which is a separate company also created during the breakup of the Zodiac Group in 2007.\nZodiac boats were brought into American popular culture in the late 1960s. They were ubiquitous in the popular television documentary series, The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.\nThe word \"ZODIAC\" is a registered trademark for rigid-hulled inflatable boats.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "\"Life Network\" redirects here. For the earlier, now-defunct Canadian television network of similar name, see The Life Channel.\nSlice is a Canadian English language Category A specialty channel owned by Corus Entertainment.\nSlice broadcasts lifestyle and entertainment programming aimed at women in the form of reality television series, documentaries, talk shows, and other features. Program topics typically focus on such areas as fashion and beauty, entertainment, health, finance, and relationships.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Life Network ===\nIn June 1994, Your Channel Television Inc., a company majority owned by Atlantis Television Ventures Inc. (Atlantis Communications), was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a channel called YOU: Your Channel, described at the time as broadcasting \"programming consisting of documentaries and information programming.\" The channel was grouped into five themes, \"\"Habitat\" stressing programming for the home and environment; \"Bodyworks\" covering fitness, health and nutrition; \"Food Plus\" including programs related to cooking and food; \"Explorations\" dealing with travel, adventure and nature; and \"Relationships\" focusing on parenting, child care, careers and personal relationships.\"\nThe channel was launched on January 1, 1995, as Life Network. The channel broadcast programs in themes focusing on such areas as food, gardening, and home design.\nIn June 1998, Atlantis Communications announced that it planned to merge with Alliance Communications, another fellow television and film producer and broadcaster, owners of History Television and Showcase at the time, to form a new company called Alliance Atlantis Communications. The CRTC approved the merger in May 1999.\nProgramming on the channel shifted to programming about issues relating to everyday life, mostly in the form of non-competitive reality television, talk shows, as other Alliance Atlantis-owned channels such as HGTV and Food Network launched in 1997 and 2000, respectively.\n\n\n=== Slice ===\nPlans to relaunch the channel as Slice were announced in November 2, 2006 by Alliance Atlantis Communications. The new name and programming reflects Life's shift towards a more entertainment based schedule with what Alliance Atlantis called \"addictive\" programming. The name was revealed in a 2006 Life Network online survey on future programming strategies. The channel was relaunched on March 5, 2007, although the on-air branding appeared intermittently during a \"sneak preview\" on March 3 and 4.\nOn January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media, acquired control of Slice through its purchase of Alliance Atlantis' broadcasting assets, which were placed in a trust in August 2007. On October 27, 2010, ownership changed again as Shaw Communications gained control of Slice as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs' interest in CW Media.\nOn May 29, 2013, Shaw Media launched Slice HD, a high definition simulcast of the standard definition feed. It is currently available on EastLink, Shaw Direct, Shaw Cable, Bell Fibe TV & Bell TV. In the same year, Slice began using an alternative blue logo for certain programs.\nOn April 1, 2016, Slice's parent company Shaw Media was sold to Corus Entertainment. Since then, Slice has been under the same ownership as Corus' other women's networks, including Cosmopolitan TV, a Category B entertainment channel co-owned by Hearst and the W Network.\n\n\n== Programming ==\n\nSlice is known to air numerous series from the U.S. cable network, Bravo, in addition to producing several original programs of its own.\n\n\n=== Notable series ===\n72 Hours\nBig Brother: After Dark\nBig Brother Canada\nBig Brother Canada Side Show\n\nCasino Confidential\nDogs with Jobs\nEx-Wives of Rock\nFour Weddings Canada\nFriends\nKendra on Top\nKing of the Nerds\nLaw and Order: Special Victims Unit\nMob Wives\nMy Teenage Wedding\nPrincess (TV series)\nSee no Evil\nTil Debt Do Us Part\nThe Hero\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\nThe Real Housewives of Dallas\nThe Real Housewives of New York City\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County\nThe Real Housewives of Potomac\nThe Real Housewives of Vancouver\nThe Real Housewives of Toronto\nWedding SOS\n\n\n== Logos ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

The same event is retold in 1 Esdras 1:32, although it lacks any reference to writing, or the recording of the lamentation. Nevertheless, the dirges referred to in 2 Chronicles and 1 Esdras, as well as Lamentations may refer to a larger corpus of laments that once existed in the temple or palace archives of ancient Jerusalem.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTable of books of Judeo-Christian Scripture\n\n\n== External links ==\nMyers, Jacob II Chronicles: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary.

            "content": "Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. It may be taken to ask whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles entail the existence of such a square.\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi (\u03c0) is a transcendental, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. It had been known for some decades before then that the construction would be impossible if \u03c0 were transcendental, but \u03c0 was not proven transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to \u03c0.\nThe expression \"squaring the circle\" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.\nThe term quadrature of the circle is sometimes used to mean the same thing as squaring the circle, but it may also refer to approximate or numerical methods for finding the area of a circle.\n\n\n== History ==\nMethods to approximate the area of a given circle with a square, which can be thought of as a precursor problem to squaring the circle, were known already to Babylonian mathematicians. The Egyptian Rhind papyrus of 1800 BC gives the area of a circle as (64/81) d 2, where d is the diameter of the circle. In modern terms, this is equivalent to approximating pi(\u03c0) by 256/81, a number that appears in the older Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and is used for volume approximations (i.e. hekat). Indian mathematicians also found an approximate method, though less accurate, documented in the Shulba Sutras. Archimedes proved the formula for the area of a circle (A = \u03c0r2, where r is the radius of the circle) and showed that the value of \u03c0 lay between 3 + 1/7 (approximately 3.1429) and 3 + 10/71 (approximately 3.1408). See Numerical approximations of \u03c0 for more on the history.\nThe first known Greek to be associated with the problem was Anaxagoras, who worked on it while in prison. Hippocrates of Chios squared certain lunes, in the hope that it would lead to a solution \u2014 see Lune of Hippocrates. Antiphon the Sophist believed that inscribing regular polygons within a circle and doubling the number of sides will eventually fill up the area of the circle, and since a polygon can be squared, it means the circle can be squared. Even then there were skeptics\u2014Eudemus argued that magnitudes cannot be divided up without limit, so the area of the circle will never be used up. The problem was even mentioned in Aristophanes's play The Birds.\nIt is believed that Oenopides was the first Greek who required a plane solution (that is, using only a compass and straightedge). James Gregory attempted a proof of its impossibility in Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura (The True Squaring of the Circle and of the Hyperbola) in 1667. Although his proof was faulty, it was the first paper to attempt to solve the problem using algebraic properties of \u03c0. It was not until 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann rigorously proved its impossibility.\n\nThe Victorian-age mathematician, logician and author, Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (better known under the pseudonym \"Lewis Carroll\") also expressed interest in debunking illogical circle-squaring theories. In one of his diary entries for 1855, Dodgson listed books he hoped to write including one called \"Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers\". In the introduction to \"A New Theory of Parallels\", Dodgson recounted an attempt to demonstrate logical errors to a couple of circle-squarers, stating:\n\nThe first of these two misguided visionaries filled me with a great ambition to do a feat I have never heard of as accomplished by man, namely to convince a circle squarer of his error! The value my friend selected for Pi was 3.2: the enormous error tempted me with the idea that it could be easily demonstrated to BE an error. More than a score of letters were interchanged before I became sadly convinced that I had no chance.\n\nA ridiculing of circle-squaring appears in Augustus de Morgan's A Budget of Paradoxes published posthumously by his widow in 1872. Having originally published the work as a series of articles in the Athen\u00e6um, he was revising it for publication at the time of his death. Circle squaring was very popular in the nineteenth century, but hardly anyone indulges in it today and it is believed that de Morgan's work helped bring this about.\n\n\n== Impossibility ==\nThe solution of the problem of squaring the circle by compass and straightedge demands construction of the number \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u03c0\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle {\\sqrt {\\pi }}}\n  , and the impossibility of this undertaking follows from the fact that pi is a transcendental (non-algebraic and therefore non-constructible) number. If the problem of the quadrature of the circle is solved using only compass and straightedge, then an algebraic value of pi would be found, which is impossible. Johann Heinrich Lambert conjectured that pi was transcendental in 1768 in the same paper in which he proved its irrationality, even before the existence of transcendental numbers was proven. It was not until 1882 that Ferdinand von Lindemann proved its transcendence.\nThe transcendence of pi implies the impossibility of exactly \"circling\" the square, as well as of squaring the circle.\nIt is possible to construct a square with an area arbitrarily close to that of a given circle. If a rational number is used as an approximation of pi, then squaring the circle becomes possible, depending on the values chosen. However, this is only an approximation and does not meet the constraints of the ancient rules for solving the problem. Several mathematicians have demonstrated workable procedures based on a variety of approximations.\nBending the rules by allowing an infinite number of compass-and-straightedge operations or by performing the operations in certain non-Euclidean geometries also makes squaring the circle possible in some sense. For example, although the circle cannot be squared in Euclidean space, it sometimes can be in hyperbolic geometry under suitable interpretations of the terms. As there are no squares in the hyperbolic plane, their role needs to be taken by regular quadrilaterals, meaning quadrilaterals with all sides congruent and all angles congruent (but these angles are strictly smaller than right angles). There exist, in the hyperbolic plane, (countably) infinitely many pairs of constructible circles and constructible regular quadrilaterals of equal area, which, however, are constructed simultaneously. There is no method for starting with a regular quadrilateral and constructing the circle of equal area, and there is no method for starting with a circle and constructing a regular quadrilateral of equal area (even when the circle has small enough radius such that a regular quadrilateral of equal area exists).\n\n\n== Modern approximative constructions ==\nThough squaring the circle is an impossible problem using only compass and straightedge, approximations to squaring the circle can be given by constructing lengths close to \u03c0. It takes only minimal knowledge of elementary geometry to convert any given rational approximation of \u03c0 into a corresponding compass-and-straightedge construction, but constructions made in this way tend to be very long-winded in comparison to the accuracy they achieve. After the exact problem was proven unsolvable, some mathematicians applied their ingenuity to finding elegant approximations to squaring the circle, defined roughly and informally as constructions that are particularly simple among other imaginable constructions that give similar precision.\nAmong the modern approximate constructions was one by E. W. Hobson in 1913. This was a fairly accurate construction which was based on constructing the approximate value of 3.14164079..., which is accurate to 4 decimals (i.e. it differs from \u03c0 by about 4.8\u00d710\u22125).\nIndian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan in 1913, Carl Olds in 1963, Martin Gardner in 1966, and Benjamin Bold in 1982 all gave geometric constructions for\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            355\n            113\n          \n        \n        =\n        3.1415929203539823008\n        \u2026\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {355}{113}}=3.1415929203539823008\\dots }\n  \nwhich is accurate to six decimal places of \u03c0.\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan in 1914 gave a ruler-and-compass construction which was equivalent to taking the approximate value for \u03c0 to be\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                9\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              +\n              \n                \n                  \n                    19\n                    \n                      2\n                    \n                  \n                  22\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            4\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              2143\n              22\n            \n            \n              4\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        3.1415926525826461252\n        \u2026\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left(9^{2}+{\\frac {19^{2}}{22}}\\right)^{1/4}={\\sqrt[{4}]{\\frac {2143}{22}}}=3.1415926525826461252\\dots }\n  \ngiving eight decimal places of \u03c0. He describes his construction till line segment OS as follows.\n\n\"Let AB (Fig.2) be a diameter of a circle whose centre is O. Bisect the arc ACB at C and trisect AO at T. Join BC and cut off from it CM and MN equal to AT. Join AM and AN and cut off from the latter AP equal to AM. Through P draw PQ parallel to MN and meeting AM at Q. Join OQ and through T draw TR, parallel to OQ and meeting AQ at R. Draw AS perpendicular to AO and equal to AR, and join OS. Then the mean proportional between OS and OB will be very nearly equal to a sixth of the circumference, the error being less than a twelfth of an inch when the diameter is 8000 miles long.\"\n\nIn this quadrature, Ramanujan did not construct the side length of the square, it was enough for him to show the segment OS. In the following continuation of the construction, the segment OS is used together with the segment OB to represent the mean proportionals (red segment OE).\n\nContinuation of the construction up to the searched side length a of the square:\nExtend AB beyond A and beat the circular arc b1 around O with radius OS, it results S'. Bisect the segment BS' in D and draw the semicircle b2 over D. Draw a straight line from O through C up to the semicircle b2, it cuts b2 in E. The segment OE is the mean proportional between OS and OB, also called geometric mean. Extend the segment EO beyond O and transfer EO twice more, it results F and A1, and thus the length of the segment EA1 with the above described approximation value of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi }\n  , the half circumference of the circle. Bisect the segment EA1 in G and draw the semicircle b3 over G. Transfer the distance OB from A1 to the segment EA1, it results H. Create a vertical from H up to the semicircle b3 on EA1, it results B1. Connect A1 to B1, thus the searched side \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n   of the square A1B1C1D1 is constructed, which has nearly the same area as the given circle.\nExamples to illustrate the errors:\nIn a circle of radius r = 10,000 km would be the fault of the side length a \u2248 -2.8 mm\nIn the case of a circle with the radius r = 10 m would be the error of the surface A \u2248 -0.1 mm2\n\nIn 1991, Robert Dixon gave constructions for\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            6\n            5\n          \n        \n        (\n        1\n        +\n        \u03c6\n        )\n        \n           and \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                40\n                3\n              \n            \n            \u2212\n            2\n            \n              \n                3\n              \n            \n             \n          \n        \n        =\n        3.14153333870509461863\n        \u2026\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {6}{5}}(1+\\varphi ){\\text{ and }}{\\sqrt {{40 \\over 3}-2{\\sqrt {3}}\\ }}=3.14153333870509461863\\dots }\n  \n(Kocha\u0144ski's approximation), though these were only accurate to four decimal places of \u03c0.\n\nAnother example of a modern squaring the circle\n\n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        \u22c5\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                25\n                36\n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              \n                (\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      1\n                      6\n                    \n                  \n                  +\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        348\n                        +\n                        5\n                        \n                          \n                            143\n                          \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                        36\n                        \n                          (\n                          \n                            72\n                            +\n                            \n                              \n                                143\n                              \n                            \n                          \n                          )\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                )\n              \n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n        \n          .\n        \n        77245384141934376\n        \u2026\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2\\cdot {\\sqrt {{\\frac {25}{36}}+\\left({\\frac {1}{6}}+{\\frac {348+5{\\sqrt {143}}}{36\\left(72+{\\sqrt {143}}\\right)}}\\right)^{2}}}=1{.}77245384141934376\\dots }\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        \n          .\n        \n        77245384141934376\n        \u2026\n        \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        3.141592619962188\n        \u2026\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1{.}77245384141934376\\dots ^{2}=3.141592619962188\\dots }\n  \nseven decimal places are equal to those of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {\\pi }}}\n   respectively equal to those of \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c0\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi .}\n  \n\n\n== Squaring or quadrature as integration ==\nThe problem of finding the area under a curve, known as integration in calculus, or quadrature in numerical analysis, was known as squaring before the invention of calculus. Since the techniques of calculus were unknown, it was generally presumed that a squaring should be done via geometric constructions, that is, by compass and straightedge. For example, Newton wrote to Oldenburg in 1676 \"I believe M. Leibnitz will not dislike the Theorem towards the beginning of my letter pag. 4 for squaring Curve lines Geometrically\" (emphasis added). After Newton and Leibniz invented calculus, they still referred to this integration problem as squaring a curve.\n\n\n== Claims of circle squaring ==\n\n\n=== Connection with the longitude problem ===\nThe mathematical proof that the quadrature of the circle is impossible using only compass and straightedge has not proved to be a hindrance to the many people who have invested years in this problem anyway. Having squared the circle is a famous crank assertion. (See also pseudomathematics.) In his old age, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes convinced himself that he had succeeded in squaring the circle.\nDuring the 18th and 19th century, the notion that the problem of squaring the circle was somehow related to the longitude problem seems to have become prevalent among would-be circle squarers. Using \"cyclometer\" for circle-squarer, Augustus de Morgan wrote in 1872:\n\nMontucla says, speaking of France, that he finds three notions prevalent among cyclometers: 1. That there is a large reward offered for success; 2. That the longitude problem depends on that success; 3. That the solution is the great end and object of geometry. The same three notions are equally prevalent among the same class in England. No reward has ever been offered by the government of either country.\n\nAlthough from 1714 to 1828 the British government did indeed sponsor a \u00a320,000 prize for finding a solution to the longitude problem, exactly why the connection was made to squaring the circle is not clear; especially since two non-geometric methods (the astronomical method of lunar distances and the mechanical chronometer) had been found by the late 1760s. De Morgan goes on to say that \"[t]he longitude problem in no way depends upon perfect solution; existing approximations are sufficient to a point of accuracy far beyond what can be wanted.\" In his book, de Morgan also mentions receiving many threatening letters from would-be circle squarers, accusing him of trying to \"cheat them out of their prize\".\n\n\n=== Other modern claims ===\nEven after it had been proved impossible, in 1894, amateur mathematician Edwin J. Goodwin claimed that he had developed a method to square the circle. The technique he developed did not accurately square the circle, and provided an incorrect area of the circle which essentially redefined pi as equal to 3.2. Goodwin then proposed the Indiana Pi Bill in the Indiana state legislature allowing the state to use his method in education without paying royalties to him. The bill passed with no objections in the state house, but the bill was tabled and never voted on in the Senate, amid increasing ridicule from the press.\n\n\n== In literature ==\n\nThe problem of squaring the circle has been mentioned by poets such as Dante and Alexander Pope, with varied metaphorical meanings. Its literary use dates back at least to 414 BC, when the play The Birds by Aristophanes was first performed. In it, the character Meton of Athens mentions squaring the circle, possibly to indicate the paradoxical nature of his utopian city.\nDante's Paradise canto XXXIII lines 133\u2013135 contain the verses:\n\nFor Dante, squaring the circle represents a task beyond human comprehension, which he compares to his own inability to comprehend Paradise.\nBy 1742, when Alexander Pope published the fourth book of his Dunciad, attempts at circle-squaring had come to be seen as \"wild and fruitless\":\n\nSimilarly, the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera Princess Ida features a song which satirically lists the impossible goals of the women's university run by the title character, such as finding perpetual motion. One of these goals is \"And the circle \u2013 they will square it/Some fine day.\"\nThe sestina, a poetic form first used in the 12th century by Arnaut Daniel, has been said to square the circle in its use of a square number of lines (six stanzas of six lines each) with a circular scheme of six repeated words. Spanos (1978) writes that this form invokes a symbolic meaning in which the circle stands for heaven and the square stands for the earth. A similar metaphor was used in \"Squaring The Circle\", a 1908 short story by O. Henry, about a long-running family feud. In the title of this story, the circle represents the natural world, while the square represents the city, the world of man.\nIn James Joyce's novel Ulysses, Leopold Bloom dreams of becoming wealthy by squaring the circle, unaware that the quadrature of the circle had been proved impossible 22 years earlier and that the British government had never offered a reward for its solution.\nHonor\u00e9 de Balzac's story S\u00e9raph\u00eeta alludes to the problem of squaring the circle.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe two other classical problems of antiquity were doubling the cube and trisecting the angle, described in the compass and straightedge article. Unlike squaring the circle, these two problems can be solved by the slightly more powerful construction method of origami, as described at mathematics of paper folding.\nThe Hobbes\u2013Wallis controversy, a 17th-century dispute in the philosophy of mathematics sparked by Hobbes' failed proof of squaring the circle\nFor a more modern related problem, see Tarski's circle-squaring problem.\nThe Indiana Pi Bill, an 1897 attempt in the Indiana state legislature to dictate a solution to the problem by legislative fiat.\nSquircle, a mathematical shape with properties between those of a square and those of a circle.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSquaring the circle at the MacTutor History of Mathematics archive\nSquaring the Circle at cut-the-knot\nCircle Squaring at MathWorld, includes information on procedures based on various approximations of pi\n\"Squaring the Circle\" at \"Convergence\"\nThe Quadrature of the Circle and Hippocrates' Lunes at Convergence\nHow to Unroll a Circle Pi accurate to eight decimal places, using straightedge and compass.\nSquaring the Circle and Other Impossibilities, lecture by Robin Wilson, at Gresham College, 16 January 2008 (available for download as text, audio or video file).\nGrime, James. \"Squaring the Circle\".

Luigi got sick on the voyage; therefore, he was not permitted to enter the U.S. So both brothers jumped ship and came into America as illegal immigrants, settling in New York City.\n\n\n== Crime involvement ==\nTuffanelli got more involved in the life of crime and became more invested in the Italian Mafia as time passed. He moved to the southside of Chicago, where he became a friend and associate of notorious gangsters such as Al Capone, \"Umbrella\" Mike, and Jimmy Derrico. Tuffanelli became a powerful member in the Chicago Outfit and ran the southside as boss of Blue Island.\nAfter his rise to power and success, he started investing his money in racecars and then moved with the mob to Las Vegas, Nevada, to invest in the casinos.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAAA Championship History 1948 AutoSport Bulletin Board\nhttp://www.kalracing.com/Autoracing/chicago_whispers_may%2025%202009.htm",

The group's core consisted of singer and guitarist Milan Mladenovi\u0107, keyboardist Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and bassist Bojan Pe\u010dar, with other members mostly remaining for comparatively shorter periods.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Post-punk years (1982\u20131986) ===\nFollowing the disbandment of \u0160arlo Akrobata, in February 1982, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 (guitar, vocals) with Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107 (guitar), Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 (drums), and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 (bass) formed the band Katarina II, named after Mihailovi\u0107's unrequited love, a girl named Katarina. During the late 1982, after the performance at the cinema Top\u010diderska zvezda, the band was joined by the classically trained pianist Margita Stefanovi\u0107. At the time, the rhythm section had changed, with Radomirovi\u0107 leaving to join Du Du A and Dejanovi\u0107 joining the heated rivals Disciplina Ki\u010dme.\nThe vacant drummer position was taken over by the former Grupa I member Branko Ku\u0161trin \"Mango\", but after not more than a month's period he left the band, being replaced by Milan's former bandmate from \u0160arlo Akrobata Ivan Vdovi\u0107 \"VD\". At the same time, on early 1983, Bojan Pe\u010dar, a former VIA Talas bassist became the new band member. In the spring of 1983 the band took part in Zagreb Bienalle and received positive reviews. Their material for the debut album material was recorded soon after, featuring guest appearance by the actor Svetislav Gonci\u0107 on tin whistles. The recording sessions for the material were completed in the Druga Maca studio owned by Enco Lesi\u0107 however, due to a variety of reasons, most of them having to do with the poor technical equipment, the material was unusable.\nThe following year in RTV Ljubljana studios, the band took the offer of fellow musician Sr\u0111an Marjanovi\u0107, who was the label's musical director at the time, to rerecord the material for the debut album. Katarina II eponymous debut album was eventually released in 1984, mostly featuring the lyrics written by Mladenovi\u0107, except for the songs \"Vrt\" (\"The Garden\") and \"Platforme\" (\"The Platforms\") written by Mihajlovi\u0107, while the music was a collaboration between the two. The tracks like \"Aut\" (\"Out\"), \"Jesen\" (\"Autumn\"), \"Radostan dan\" (\"A Joyful Day\"), \"Treba da se \u010disti\" (\"It Ought To Be Cleaned\"), \"Ja znam\" (\"I Know\") the band successfully linked Milan's descriptive lyrical sensibility with the energetic new wave sound. The material was produced by \u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107 and featured guest appearances by Mario \u010celik on congas Film member Jurij Novoseli\u0107 \"Kuzma Videosex\" on saxophone.\nSoon after the album release, the band went through more lineup changes. Mihajlovi\u0107 ran afoul of the law and went to jail and after serving the punishment he was informed by the rest of the band that he was no longer a Katarina II member. However, since Mihajlovi\u0107 claimed rights to the usage of the Katarina II band name, he forced the band into using another one. Later he collaborated with Vlada Divljan before moving to the United States where he currently resides. Additionally, drummer Vdovi\u0107 left due to drug abuse problems, later joining Du Du A and the band Heroji, being replaced by the former Luna drummer Ivan Fece \"Firchie\". The remaining members continued working as Ekatarina Velika, after Catherine II of Russia, or EKV for short. Due to constant SFR Yugoslavia-wide touring, with frequent stops in Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana, and occasional TV spots, the band's popularity had gradually grown.\nAt the beginning of the following year, the band recorded their second studio album, recorded at the Zagreb SIM studio and produced by Vladimir Smolec, Tomo in der M\u00fchlen and the band members themselves. Ekatarina Velika, featuring Massimo Savi\u0107 and Karlowy Wary member Tomo in der M\u00fchlen as guests, provided the band with its first hits, \"O\u010di boje meda\" (\"Honey Colored Eyes\"), \"Modro i zeleno\" (\"Indigo and Green\") and \"Tattoo\". In accordance with the latter song, the album cover arranged by Du\u0161an Gerzi\u0107 feature the band members painted in Native American ritual body art. After the album release, on March 22, 1985, they played outside of Yugoslavia for the first time, making a positive impression at Culture Days in Turin, Italy. Another memorable concert took place in Zagreb as part of Bolje vas na\u0161li Belgrade-Zagreb band exchange.\nTowards the end of 1985, Fece left the band to serve the mandatory Yugoslav People's Army service, later joining Laboratorija Zvuka, and was replaced by the Ivan Rankovi\u0107 \"Raka\" from the band Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. The following year, the new lineup released the third studio album S vetrom uz lice (Faced Against the Wind), proving to be the breakthrough album that turned them into bona fide stars. The album was produced by Milan Mladenovi\u0107, Margita Stefanovi\u0107 and Dragan \u010ca\u010dinovi\u0107, extensively using the E-mu Emulator II 8-bit sampler. With the hits \"Budi sam na ulici\" (\"Be Alone on the Street\"), \"Ti si sav moj bol\" (\"You Are All My Anguish\"), \"Novac u rukama\" (\"Money in the Hands\"), and \"Kao da je bilo nekad\" (\"As If It Had Once Been\") came some lukewarm reviews from the critics complaining about the similarities to the works of the Simple Minds.\nAfter the album release, the band toured extensively all over former Yugoslavia, and the recording of one of the five sold-out performances at the Zagreb club Kulu\u0161i\u0107, made on November 2, 1986, was released in early 1987 on the live album EKV 19LIVE!86. The band promoted the release of the live album in Belgrade during January 1987 and triumphed at Dom Omladine with six sold-out shows. During spring of the same year, Ivan Rankovi\u0107 decided to leave EKV in order to form a new group Ulica Od Meseca with his old bandmates from Tvrdo Srce i Velike U\u0161i. Rankovi\u0107 was replaced by the actor Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, a former Disciplina Ki\u010dme became the new drummer, playing his first show on April 9, 1987, at the New Rock festival held at the La Locomotive club in Paris. On autumn of the same year, the band got the Sedam Sekretara SKOJa for the achievements on the second and third studio album.\n\n\n=== Alternative rock years (1987\u20131991) ===\nDuring the summer of 1987, the band released the album Ljubav (Love), co-produced by the band with the Australian musician Theodore Yanni. It displayed a more guitar-oriented sound, along with stylized sleeve done by Margita and artist Vuk Vidor. Prominent tracks from the album include \"Zemlja\" (\"Earth\"), \"7 Dana\" (\"7 Days\"), \"Pored mene\" (\"Beside Me\"), \"Ljudi iz gradova\" (\"People From The Cities\"), and \"Ljubav\" (\"Love\"). It had also shown the first signs of Milan's depressive lyrics, as exemplified by song \"Tonemo\" (\"We Are Sinking\"). The album had also confirmed their live attraction status with two consecutive sold out shows at Belgrade's Pionir Hall sports arena. New extensive tour commenced in early 1988, and EKV enlisted help from Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 of Oktobar 1864 and Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 from Van Gogh to appear as backing live musicians. Fece had also promptly rejoined the band on tour, shortly replacing Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 before moving away to New York City in May 1988.\nIn January 1989, the band finished the recording sessions for the album Samo par godina za nas (Only a Few Years for Us), released during the same year, featuring guest appearances by Mitar Suboti\u0107 (guitar, album production) and Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 (backing vocals). The critics regarded this album as a mere of the concept from the previous album. Several hits from the album include \"Krug\" (\"The Circle\"), \"Par godina za nas\" (\"A Few Years for Us\"), and \"Srce\" (\"Heart\"). Despite the mixed critics, the band were at their peak performing at the EBU-UER rock festival in Novi Sad, the 1990 Midem festival in Cannes and the first European rock music bienalle held in Toulouse. After the tour, Todorovi\u0107 left the band, focusing on his acting career. Bojan Pe\u010dar also decided to leave the band moving to London. The new members became the former VIA Talas, D' Boys and Piloti member Mi\u0161ko Petrovi\u0107 \"Plavi\" on bass and the former U \u0160kripcu member Marko Milivojevi\u0107 on drums.\nThe sixth studio album Dum dum (Bang Bang), released in 1991, featured the Plejboj member Du\u0161an Petrovi\u0107 and session musician Bata Bo\u017eani\u0107 as bass players, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 on backing vocals, Zvonimir \u0110uki\u0107 on guitar and Mitar Suboti\u0107 on keyboards and machines. The album, produced by Theodore Yanni, featured the prominent songs \"Zabranjujem\" (\"I Forbid\"), \"Idemo\" (\"Let's Go\"), \"Dum dum\" (\"Bang Bang\") and \"Bledo\" (\"Pale\"), inspired by the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars and the general political and economical situation in the country. The following year, Mladenovi\u0107 participated in the antiwar project Rimtutituki, also featuring Elektri\u010dni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members, releasing the single \"Slu\u0161aj 'vamo\" (\"Listen Up\").\n\n\n=== Mainstream rock years (1992\u20131994) ===\nDuring the summer of 1992 the band toured with the new bassist Dragi\u0161a Uskokovi\u0107 \"\u0106ima\", with whom they recorded the final studio album Neko nas posmatra (Somebody Is Watching Us), released in May 1993. The album featured a more accessible and communicative sound especially present in the songs \"Ponos\" (\"Pride\"), \"Jadransko more\" (\"The Adriatic Sea\"), \"Just Let Me Play Some Modern R'n'R Music\" and \"Zajedno\" (\"Together\"). For the first time, the band had included a cover song on and album, \"Istina Ma\u0161ina\" (\"Truth Machine\"), originally performed by the Yugoslav rock band Time. The album was produced by Mladenovi\u0107 and featured Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107, Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107 and a childer choir as guest performers.\nAfter the album release, in September of the same year, Ekatarina Velika, Elektri\u010dni Orgazam, Partibrejkers and the Zagreb band Vje\u0161tice performed in Prague and Berlin on the concerts entitled Ko to tamo pjeva (Who's That Singing Over There). At the time, Mladenovi\u0107 and Stefanovi\u0107 held occasional unplugged club performances, often featuring guest appearances by the Partibrejkers guitarist Neboj\u0161a Antonijevi\u0107 \"Anton\" and various jazz musicians, until Milan's departure to Brazil, where he worked on a project called Angel's Breath, together with Mitar Suboti\u0107 and a line-up of Brazilian musicians. The two started recording the material partially written in 1985 when, with the guitarist Goran Vejvoda, they had several live appearances under the moniker Dah An\u0111ela (Angel's Breath).\n\n\n=== Breakup and post-breakup ===\nThe band resumed their activities when Mladenovi\u0107 returned to Yugoslavia. There were plans to make a new album, tentatively titled Ponovo zajedno (Together Again), but the idea was shelved because of Milan's health problems. EKV played what would turn out to be their last ever show on August 24, 1994 in Budva at the Pjesma Mediterana festival. The very next day Milan was held in a hospital, and it was soon discovered that he had pancreatic cancer. Barely a few months later, on November 5, 1994, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died in Belgrade, at the age of 36, thus Ekatarina Velika ceased to exist.\nMargita Stefanovi\u0107 continued working as a musician, for a short period of time performing with the cover band Kurajberi. In 1995, with Vladimir Stojanovi\u0107, as an ambiental music duo EQV, she released the album Ti si sav moj bol (You Are All My Anguish), released by the Austrian record label Coop Arts Crafts Unltd. In October of the same year, EQV appeared at the Vienna Talkit festival. She had also made occasional live appearances with the bands Direktori, Glisers and Zion Banda, and appeared as guest on the albums of several Belgrade rock bands. In 1996, she appeared on the Elektri\u010dni Orgazam unplugged live album \u017divo i akusti\u010dno (Live and Acoustic), and in 1998, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights signing, she appeared in Pula with Zoran Stojanovi\u0107, the leader of the Zagreb band Veliki Bijeli Slon, being, along with Rambo Amadeus, the first Serbian musician to play in Croatia after the Yugoslav Wars.\nDuring the early 1997, a posthumous live album entitled Live '88 was released, featuring the recordings of the performances from Zagreb and Novi Sad held during the 1988 tour. The Zagreb recordings, made at the Kulu\u0161i\u0107 club, were announced by the rock critic Dra\u017een Vrdoljak and featured Theodore Yanni on guest guitar. The live recordings were owned by Fece who initiated the album release.

Of the bands heavily influenced by Ekatarina Velika, by far the most notable is Van Gogh, which has risen to the status of one of the most popular rock acts in Serbia in the second half of the 1990s. Another band highly inspired by EKV is the alternative rock band Block Out. The band's work was also praised by Yugoslav rock icons like Rambo Amadeus and Dado Topic\nIn 2003, a tribute album to Mladenovi\u0107 entitled Kao da je bilo nekad... Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u (Like It Happened Someday... Dedicated to Milan Mladenovi\u0107) was released. The album consists of 15 covers of Mladenovi\u0107's songs (14 EKV and one \u0160arlo Akrobata song) by a range of musicians, spanning from rock veteran Dado Topi\u0107, over EKV contemporaries like Elektri\u010dni Orgazam, Darko Rundek, Partibrejkers, Mi\u0161ko Plavi, Vlada Divljan, Del Arno Band, and Tanja Jovi\u0107evi\u0107, to younger acts, like Jarboli, Darkwood Dub, Novembar, Night Shift, Block Out, and VROOM. Mladenovi\u0107's former \u0160arlo Akrobata bandmate Du\u0161an Koji\u0107 also appeared on the album under the pseudonym Crni Zub, participating in the cover of \"Zemlja\".\nAnother tribute album, released in 2003, was a live album Jako dobar tattoo - Tribute to EKV (Very Good Tattoo - Tribute to EKV), recorded at the tribute concert held on February 22, 2003, in Zagreb's Tvornica club. The performers included Croatian bands Le Cinema, Vatra, and Urban & 4, and solo artists Massimo Savi\u0107 with EKV tribute band Veliki Bijeli Slon, Darko Rundek with his Cargo Orkestar, and Elektri\u010dni Orgazam frontman Sr\u0111an \"Gile\" Gojkovi\u0107, also with Veliki Bijeli Slon. The album consists of 13 live covers, each artist performing several.\nThe book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music), published in 1998, features two albums by the band: S' vetrom uz lice (ranked No. 26) and Katarina II (album) (ranked No. 68). The list of 100 greatest Yugoslav album, published by Croatian edition of Rolling Stone in 2015, features three Ekatarina Velika albums: S' vetrom uz lice (ranked No. 10) and Katarina II (ranked No. 29) and Ekatarina Velika (ranked No. 44).\nThe Rock Express Top 100 Yugoslav Rock Songs of All Times list, published in 2000, featured five songs by Ekatarina Velika: \"Krug\" (polled No.3), \"Par godina za nas\" (polled No.11), \"Ti si sav moj bol\" (polled No.41), \"Zemlja\" (polled No.54) and \"7 dana\" (polled No.86). In November 2006, \"Par godina za nas\" was polled the Best Yugoslav Popular Music Song on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs list. In 2011, the songs \"Krug\" and \"Par godina za nas\" were polled, by the listeners of Radio 202, two of 60 greatest songs released by PGP-RTB/PGP-RTS during the sixty years of the label's existence.\nThe lyrics of 15 songs by the band were featured in Petar Janjatovi\u0107's book Pesme bratstva, detinjstva & potomstva: Antologija ex YU rok poezije 1967 - 2007 (Songs of Brotherhood, Childhood & Offspring: Anthology of Ex YU Rock Poetry 1967 - 2007).\nIn July 2011, the hardscape area in front of the Belgrade Youth Center was named the Milan Mladenovi\u0107 Place.

D. in Molecular Biophysics from Washington University in 2000. As a postdoctoral fellow, he received a Master of Psychiatric Epidemiology from Washington University 2003.\n\n\n== Research ==\nGrucza's research mainly focuses on genetic and environmental causes of addiction, as well as the health effects of alcohol consumption.\nHe his colleagues have conducted research on the long-term effects of the minimum legal drinking age showing that youth who were legally restricted from drinking until age 21 had lower risk for alcoholism and other problems later in adulthood compared to those who were legally permitted to purchase alcohol at earlier ages. He has also conducted research on long-term effects of tobacco control policies targeting youth purchases. These studies were noted in the Institute of Medicine\u2019s 2015 report on the potential public health benefits of raising the tobacco purchase age to 21.\nSeveral of his studies have examined the \"closing gender gap\" for alcohol problems in the U.S., documenting that rates of alcoholism and binge drinking for women have become closer to those for men over the long term.\nIn a 2014 study, he and his colleagues found that the adoption of tobacco control policies by certain U.S. states was associated with decreases in suicide rates in these states.\nIn 2016, he led a study analyzing data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health that found that the increase in marijuana use by American adults was less than that initially reported. In a related study, he found that rates of marijuna use disorder among U.S. adolescents had declined over the years 2002 to 2013 and that this may be related to declining rates of delinquency. He is an advocate for marijuana decriminalization.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nGrucza has received the Walter G. Klopfer Award from the Society for Personality Assessment for distinguished contribution to the literature in personality assessment, and was named an Outstanding Public Health Transdisciplinary Scholar by Washington University\u2019s Institute for Public Health in 2012.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRichard Grucza publications indexed by Google Scholar",

            "content": "The South African War Memorial is a First World War memorial in Richmond Cemetery in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, the memorial is in the form of a cenotaph, similar to that on Whitehall, also by Lutyens. It was commissioned by the South African Hospital and Comforts Fund Committee to commemorate the 39 South African soldiers who died of their wounds at a military hospital in Richmond Park during the First World War. The memorial was unveiled by General Jan Smuts in 1921 and was the focus of pilgrimages from South Africa through the 1920s and 1930s, after which it was largely forgotten until the 1980s when the Commonwealth War Graves Commission took responsibility for its maintenance. It has been a grade II listed building since 2012.\n\n\n== Background ==\nRichmond Park, adjacent to the cemetery, was the location of the South African Military Hospital during the First World War, and 39 South African soldiers who died at the hospital were buried in Richmond Cemetery. After the end of the war, the South African Hospital and Comforts Fund Committee resolved to erect a memorial in the area of the cemetery known as \"soldiers' corner\", which includes the graves of the 39 South Africans. The committee commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \"the leading English architect of his generation\" to design the memorial, Lutyens having previously designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations. Lutyens was also responsible for the Rand Regiments Memorial (later renamed the Anglo-Boer War Memorial) in Johannesburg, erected in 1911 to commemorate the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902)\u2014his first war memorial. After the First World War, he worked extensively with the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWCG) to design memorials in cemeteries on the Western Front, including the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing\u2014the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world\u2014and the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large IWCG cemeteries.\nHistoric England described Richmond Cemetery as being \"unusually well endowed with war memorials and war graves\". Close to the South African Memorial is a section dedicated to ex-servicemen from the Royal Star and Garter Home in Richmond, which is marked by the Bromhead Memorial.\n\n\n== History and design ==\nThe memorial is in the form of a cenotaph, constructed in coarse granite to a design modelled on the Whitehall cenotaph. Unusually among Lutyens' memorials, it has a triangular top. It has a flared base and sits on a base of two stone steps, in contrast to the three on which most of Lutyens' memorials stand. The only significant relief on the memorial is two sculpted wreaths, one on each side, which have their own carved supports. The apex of each face bears the head of a springbok, the national symbol of South Africa, in low relief. The memorial contains inscription in both English and Dutch: on the outer face (facing away from the war graves) is the English inscription \"UNION IS STRENGTH / OUR GLORIOUS DEAD\", on the base below which is an inscribed cross; on the opposite side, facing the graves, is the same dedication in Dutch, \"EENDRAGHT MAAKT MACHT, ONZEN GEVALLENEN HELDEN\". On the north side of the cenotaph is engraved the Roman numeral MMXIV (1914) and on the south MMXIX (1919).\n\nAccording to Lutyens researcher Tim Skelton, the starkness of the South African Memorial in comparison to other Lutyens memorials and its differences to his other works is symbolic of the breakdown of the relationship between Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The two architects had collaborated on several projects in South Africa and India, but ultimately fell out over an alteration to the design of New Delhi.\nThe memorial was unveiled on 30 June 1921 and formally accepted by South African General Jan Smuts, who had previously laid the foundation stone, on behalf of the South African government in a ceremony officiated by the Bishop of St Albans. After the unveiling, it became a focal point for pilgrims from South Africa throughout the 1920s and 1930s, but thereafter fell into a state of neglect, in part due to strained relationships with South Africa during the apartheid era. It came to the attention of the IWGC (by then renamed the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) in 1981, and the commission agreed to take responsibility for its maintenance on behalf of the South African government.\nSince 24 July 2012, the cenotaph has been designated a grade II listed building for its special architectural or historic interest, a status which offers legal protection from unauthorised demolition or unauthorised modification. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \"national collection\" and all 44 of his free-standing memorials were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nBeach, Darren (2013).

With a summit height of 517 m above NN the Rahnfels is the highest point in the Palatine Forest north of the River Isenach.\n\n\n== Summit plateau ==\nOn the summit plateau of the Rahnfels there is an observation point, the Frankenthaler Hut. This simple, wooden refuge hut was erected in 1906 by the Frankenthal branch of the Palatine Forest Club and offers shelter to hikers in inclement weather.\nDuring the Cold War there was a US Forces radio relay site and a telephone call forwarding facility for the DSN network on the southern side of the summit. The tarmac road to the summit dates to this period and ends today at an enclosed and privately owned forest clearing in which the ruins of the military installation are still recognisable.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nThe Rahnfelsen may be accessed either on a scenic, country walk(Waymark: red dot) or via the L518 state road, which starts at the southern edge of Leistadt at a roundabout. At kilometre 7 a tarmac lane branches off to the left on a right-hand bend. After about 1.5 km the summit plateau is reached.\n\n\n== References ==",

During an international event he met the French poker player Bertrand Grospellier. Grospellier inspired Veldhuis into playing online poker. In 2005, Grospellier deposited Veldhuis' first $10 at PokerStars.\nLater he played live tournaments as well, but wasn't used to the slow pace. Online, he was used to playing very fast, and many tables at a time. While playing live, he often complained about the slow pace of the game. He met professional tennis player Raemon Sluiter, who advised him about sports mentality. Later Veldhuis helped and mentored Sluiter's girlfriend F\u00e1tima Moreira de Melo with her professional poker career.\nVeldhuis was knocked out of the WSOP Vegas 2009 on day 2 after finishing high in day 1 through bluffs, which eventually caught him and ended his main event competition without cashing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLex Veldhuis Hendon Mob profile",

            "content": "No Berlusconi Day was a spontaneous mass political event organised by the Purple people and held worldwide on December 5, 2009. The protest was organized almost entirely through the Internet. The supporters were also known as Onda Viola (\"Purple Wave\"), because of the color chosen to distinguish the event, and widely used by all of the participants.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe main idea behind the event was to show protest and dissatisfaction against Silvio Berlusconi's public image. Berlusconi, Italian Prime Minister at the time, was involved in a consistent amount of sex scandals, brought to court for financial crimes, and accused by many mobbers to be involved with the mafia organizations.\n\n\n== Organization ==\nOn October 6, 2009 the so-called \"lodo Alfano\", one of Berlusconi's \"ad personam\" laws, was sentenced to be against Italy's Constitutional principles of equality by the Constitutional Court. A small group of bloggers started to comment on the sentence through internet's social networks, and later proposed a public protest against Silvio Berlusconi.\nThe proposal was successful, and spread across social networks: in less than a week the \"No Berlusconi Day\" page reached over 20,000 members. The project was joined by people from all over Italy; local groups were created and people started to get organized.\nIn late October an official date was decided, December the 5th, and the main venue was to be Rome.\nPeople from all over the country and all over the world kept joining in, and by early November registered supporters had boomed to 200,000.\n\n\n== The event ==\nThe No Berlusconi Day started on December 5, at 4:00 am, Rome time schedule, when the No Berlusconi Day group from Sydney gathered. The events kept going on for the whole day, since No Berlusconi Day demonstrations took place all over the world: Berlin, Paris, London, Buenos Aires, Madrid, New York City and even Beijing.\nThe main group of supported was planned to round up in Rome.\nThe program was respected almost flawlessly. The participants met in Piazza della Repubblica and started marching at 14:00, towards piazza S. Giovanni; they passed through via Cavour, piazza S. Maria Maggiore and via Merulana. The main stage was built in Piazza San Giovanni, and the first speaker started his speech at 16:30. Many others contributions followed until 18:30, when the veteran songwriter Roberto Vecchioni buckled the day with a 30' concert.\n\n\n== Notable supporters ==\nMany prominent public figures supported the No Berlusconi Day; among them were: Antonio Di Pietro, Walter Veltroni, Nanni Moretti, Daniele Luttazzi, Paolo Flores d'Arcais, Beppe Grillo, Dario Fo, Dacia Maraini, Margherita Hack, Piero Ricca, Sabina Guzzanti, Roberto Vecchioni, Moni Ovadia, Salvatore Borsellino, Piergiorgio Odifreddi, Vincenzo Vita\n\n\n== Media coverage and Parties' attention ==\nThe event immediately attracted the media's attention, and members of the No Berlusconi-day staff appeared in TV news and were interviewed by major Italian newspapers. Most of them were ordinary people, rather unheard of by the greater public, but sometimes popular in the bloggers' community.\nThis people's uproar forced the main opposition party - the PD- to declare his position as far as supporting the No Berlusconi Day. The PD Secretary, Pierluigi Bersani, anyway remained somehow ambiguous, thus creating much disillusion in the Party's supporters and staff.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nNational news coverage\nNo Berlusconi Day London - short film\nNews coverage by TF1, french 1st national channel\nNews coverage by Spanish National Television",

            "content": "Orenda  is an Iroquois name for a spiritual power inherent in people and their environment. Activities of nature were seen to be a \"ceaseless struggle of one orenda against another, uttered and directed by the beings or bodies\" in the environment. Orenda was deemed a motive force behind miracles, soothsaying, divination, prophecy, blessing, cursing, prayer, worship, and superstitions. Orenda is not a collective power and does not have a personification. 19th and 20th century scholars compared the concept of orenda to that of mana.\nAnthropologist J. N. B. Hewitt notes intrinsic similarities between the Iroquoian concept of Orenda and that of the Siouxan wakd or mahopa; the Algonquin manitowi, and the pokunt of the Shoshone. Across the Iroquois tribes, the concept was referred to variously as orenna or karenna by the Mohawk, Cayuga, and Oneida; urente by the Tuscarora, and iarenda or orenda by the Huron. A related term, otgon, denoted a specifically \"malign, deadly, lethal, or destructive use\" of orenda. Hewitt notes that orenda was regarded by Iroquoian peoples as distinct from concepts of life, soul, ghost, and mind.\nFor the Iroquois, a shaman was considered to be \"one whose orenda is great, powerful\", while a hunter's orenda determined whether he was successful in overcoming the orenda of the game, and in conflicts between nations, orenda determined the outcome. Orenda was also present in nature: storms were said to possess orenda. A strong connection existed between prayers and songs and orenda: through song, a bird, shaman, or rabbit put forth orenda.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHewitt, J. N. B.

            "content": "There is a significant population of Zimbabweans in South Africa, making up South Africa's largest group of foreign migrants. Estimates of their numbers range from one to five million.\n\n\n== History ==\nTemporary labour migration to South Africa has long been a feature of Rhodesian and then Zimbabwean society. A 2002 survey by the Southern African Migration Project show that almost 25% of adult Zimbabweans' parents or grandparents had worked in South Africa at some point in their lives. However, permanent emigration is a relatively new phenomenon. There have been two major waves of emigration from Zimbabwe. The first was that of white people in Zimbabwe who left the country soon after the Lancaster House Agreement ended the Zimbabwe Rhodesia government; the second, still ongoing, was that of ethnic Zimbabweans beginning in the 1990s. In both cases, South Africa was again their primary destination. From 1994 onwards, the South African government displayed increasing hostility to skilled immigration from the rest of Africa. However, this has not served to limit the number of immigrants; Zimbabwean migration to South Africa since 2000 has been described as the \"largest concentrated flow\" in the country's history. Migrants previously consisted of young people arriving alone to look for work, but since 2000 have increasingly shifted towards women, children, and the elderly who are not able to work and require humanitarian assistance.\nA large proportion of the migrants are irregular; they typically pay R200 to people smugglers to take them across the Limpopo River at night and coordinate with taxi drivers who transport the migrants to Johannesburg and watch for the approach of police or soldiers.\n\n\n== Numbers and distribution ==\nEstimates of the number of Zimbabwean migrants to South Africa since 2000 range from one to five million. Exact figures are difficult to obtain due to the large proportion of undocumented migrants. There was some return migration to Zimbabwe as a result of xenophobic violence in the 2008 riots. Most reside in Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and North West, with a large concentration in the more economically-advanced urban areas of Gauteng.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nTrevor Ncube, businessman\nRoy Bennett, former parliamentarian who received asylum in South Africa in May 2007\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTevera, Daniel S.; Zinyama, Lovemore (2002), Zimbabweans Who Move: Perspectives on International Migration in Zimbabwe (PDF), Migration Policy Series, 25, Cape Town, South Africa/Ontario, Canada: The Southern African Migration Project, ISBN 1-919798-40-4, retrieved 2009-04-18 \nPolzer, Tara (2008), South African Government and Civil Society Responses to Zimbabwean Migration (PDF), Migration Policy Briefs, 22, Cape Town, South Africa/Ontario, Canada: Southern African Migration Project \n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth Africa Criticized for Zimbabwe Deportations\nUnprotected Migrants: Zimbabweans in South Africa\u2019s Limpopo Province\nPlight of Zimbabweans in South Africa alarms church officials\nZimbabweans in South Africa: Denied Access to Political Asylum",

            ], 
            "content": "Yverdon-les-Bains (French pronunciation: \u200b[iv\u025b\u0281d\u0254\u0303leb\u025b\u0303]) (called Eburodunum and Ebredunum during the Roman era) is a municipality in the district of Jura-Nord vaudois of the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It is the seat of the district. The population of Yverdon-les-Bains, as of December 2016, was 29,977.\nYverdon is located in the heart of a natural setting formed by the Jura mountains, the plains of the Orbe, the hills of the Broye and Lake Neuch\u00e2tel. It is the second most important town in the Canton of Vaud. It is famous for its thermal springs and is an important regional centre for commerce and tourism.\nIt was awarded the Wakker Prize in 2009 for the way the city handled and developed the public areas and connected the old city with Lake Neuch\u00e2tel.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe heights nearby Yverdon seem to have been settled at least since the Neolithic Age about 5000 BCE, as present archeological evidence shows. The town was at that time only a small market place, at the crossroads of terrestrial and fluvial communication ways. People began to settle, at first in temporary huts at the water-front, for fishers and merchants, then in permanent dwellings.\n\nThe Celtic Helvetii are said to have been the first permanent settlers of Eburodunum (Celtic and Roman name of Yverdon), from about the 2nd century BCE.\nAbout a century later, the Romans realized the commercial and strategic importance of this place: it controlled major routes such as Geneva-Avenches, connecting the Rh\u00f4ne and Rhine basins, as well as those of Rhone and Danube.\nThe imposing Castrum, or stronghold, called Castrum Ebredunense was the second largest in Switzerland and demonstrated the importance the Romans attached to Yverdon. The port served as naval base for the barges supplying the defensive positions along the Rhine, which marked the North-Eastern border of the Empire. Thus the Roman \"Vicus\" of Eburodunum developed into a prosperous urban centre. The sulphur springs were already used for a thermal spa, as attested by excavations. It is even possible that the Helvetii appreciated the beneficial effects of these waters.\n\n\n=== The Castrum ===\n\nAbout a century after the first invasions of the Alemanni, when the \"Vicus\" had been completely destroyed, the Romans built a large military stronghold (about 325 CE). It covered about 5 acres (20,000 m2) and was protected by gigantic ramparts and 15 masonry towers (Castrum). The Barbarians invaded Italy in the 5th century, and threatened to assault Rome. In a last desperate effort to save the city, all troops stationed North of the Alps were ordered back to Italy. The garrison and the Roman administration had to abandon the Yverdon camp. The inhabitants of Eburodunum, up to then assigned to live beyond the ramparts, immediately took possession of the Castrum, using it for their own safety. Like this, Eburodunum-Yverdon survived the hard times, until the 15th century. The Castrum was noted in the Notitia Dignitatum (dated c. 420 CE).\n\n\n=== The Savoy era ===\nWith the lake receding, the ancient town confined to the Castrum had lost its strategic position: no more direct access to the port, or to the new trade routes alongshore.\nWhen Peter II of Savoy gradually extended his rule over the Pays de Vaud (Land of Vaud), he managed to impose road tolls as well as port and fishing taxes. He founded the new town (\"Ville Neuve\") of Yverdon, defended by walls and a castle. Construction works were launched around 1259 and attracted many settlers.\n\n\n=== Yverdon Castle ===\n\nThe imposing main walls and their four towers were erected within a few years. The design of the castle followed the geometric characteristics used for castles set in plains, and had been planned by the young mason and architect Jacques de Saint-Georges. Jacques also planned Caernarvon Castle and built the castle Saint-Georges d'Esp\u00e9ranches, near Lyon.\nYverdon's castle used to be the residence of the castellans of the Savoy dynasty, until 1536, followed by the bailiffs of Bern state. In 1798, the D\u00e9partement du L\u00e9man became the castle's owner. The D\u00e9partement had been set up by the short-lived \"Helvetian Republic\" (1798\u20131803), imposed by Napoleon I.\nA few years later, Yverdon acquired the castle, to entrust it to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and his institute. After 1838, the castle housed a public school. New classrooms were created, especially on the second floor: dividing walls were erected, additional windows changed the severe look of the castle's fa\u00e7ade. After 1950, these classrooms were gradually abandoned; the last classes left in 1974. The original medieval structure was then restored. The castle is today a multi-purpose cultural centre, housing a regional museum, a theatre, various conference rooms and the oldest public library of French-speaking Switzerland, founded already in 1763. The library is now part of the castle museum, existing since 1830.\n\n\n=== The Bernese era (1536\u20131798) ===\nThe Savoy rulers granted bountiful franchise and liberties to the burghers of Yverdon. The township prospered during the two hundred years preceding the Burgundy wars.\nThe Bernese conquest followed. During the nearly three hundred years of Bernese occupation, economic life continued to thrive.\nThe 18th century proved to be one of Yverdon's most favorable periods, marked by cultural and economic highlights. Then a town of about 2.000 inhabitants, Yverdon radiated as a spa, and as a centre of thought (58 tomes of Yverdon Encyclopedia, published between 1770 and 1780), being in close contact with the great minds and movements of the time.\n\n\n=== The town hall ===\nBurnand, its architect, erected the town hall between 1768 and 1773, on the site of the former covered market. Inside the building, beautiful furniture and decorations are displayed, faience stoves, panels, wainscots and paintings. The vaults of the ancient granary are used year-round for art exhibitions.\n\n\n=== The temple ===\n\nThe Geneva architect Billon erected this Protestant church in 1757, on the site of Notre-Dame chapel of the 14th century. Its spire had been rebuilt in 1608, on the base of the original one, for which huge, sculpted blocks from the ruins of the Roman \"Castrum\" had been used.\n14 stalls, figuring apostles and prophets, originate from the ancient chapel and are ascribed to Claude de Peney, who had worked at Fribourg and Hauterive. Peney died in 1499, and Bon Bottolier, cabinetmaker in Lausanne, was charged with crafting the stalls (1501\u20131502). Potier, of French origin, built the organ in 1766.\n\n\n=== The thermal springs ===\nThe springs were known and used at least since the Roman era, but most probably before, at the time of the Helvetii. It is supposed that the spring was a sacred place, with some sort of wooden structure. Middle Age documents prove the existence of a spa centre, as early as 1429, and mention several useful buildings.\nBy 1728, the authorities decided to have a new spa constructed. Its reputation grew rapidly. The 18th century saw major developments and brilliant success, for the town and the spa. Then followed a period of decline: the spa lost its drive and popularity, and degraded to a simple political meeting point, by 1800 already. Completely neglected, the buildings dilapidated.\nEncouraged by the Spanish scientist A. Gimbernat, the local Council decided to reconstruct the spa centre and to renovate its hotel in 1897. The consequences of the First World War (1914\u20131918) were detrimental, the number of guests having significantly declined. Its reputation remained however intact, until the 1930s.\nAnother period of decay followed, and by 1960 the centre and its equipment were again so dilapidated that they had to be closed. The idea of balneology had also completely changed. The Municipality repurchased the spa, including the neighbouring Ch\u00e2teau d'Entremonts. Restoration failed twice, but the project of 1974 could finally be realized two years later. The spa reopened in 1977. Prospects for further thermal springs were successful in 1982, and a new outdoor pool could be added a year later. Today, the spa welcomes more than 1200 visitors per day.\nDuring an independent test by the RTS in February 2008, it was found that the water in the shower area of the thermal center had high levels of legionella pneumophila. During another test in 2011, the same programme found no significant levels of dangerous bacteria in the waters. However, in October 2014, there was a leak of 4000l of hydrochloric acid from one of the tanks in the thermal center. No one was hurt, and the bathers remaining in the pools were asked to evacuate.\n\n\n=== Champ-Pittet manor house ===\n\nThe 18th century manor house, near the road to Yvonand, has served as summer residence of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Haldimand, burgher of Yverdon and first Governor of Canada (1777\u20131786), when this territory became part of the British crown.\nThis country-seat belongs now to Pro Natura, the Swiss League for the Protection of Nature, and is one of its two nature centres; organizing special exhibitions, audio-visual shows as well as guided tours of the nature reserve, the Grande Caricaie.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nYverdon-les-Bains has an area, as of 2009, of 11.3 square kilometers (4.4 sq mi).

            "content": "Minako Komukai (Japanese: \u5c0f\u5411 \u7f8e\u5948\u5b50, Hepburn: Komukai Minako, born April 27, 1985 in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese gravure model, actress, erotic dancer and AV idol.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nAfter dropping out of school, at age 15 Komukai began her career as a \"gravure model\" and a swimsuit model. In 2001 she had a guest-star role as a schoolgirl in the Nippon Television comedy Danjiki: Buddhist Diet Secrets (\u6b53\u8fce\uff01\u30c0\u30f3\u30b8\u30ad\u5fa1\u4e00\u884c\u69d8, Kangei! Danjiki Goikkosama). For her appearances as a gravure idol and on television, she was selected as a \"Fuji Television Visual Queen\" for 2001. The next year she starred in the anime series Whistle! (\u30db\u30a4\u30c3\u30b9\u30eb\uff01), voicing the part of the boy hero Sho Kazamatsuri, broadcast in 2002 in 39 episodes on the Animax TV network. In 2003 Komukai starred in her first movie, the horror film Chain (\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3) directed by Atsushi Shimizu and released to theaters on July 19, 2003.\nKomukai was cast as Princess Freezia in the Toei's August 2003 theatrical release of Bakury\u016b Sentai Abaranger Deluxe: Abare Summer Is Freezing Cold!, part of the long-running Super Sentai series. She returned to TV work starring as high school girl Rion Kano in the TV Tokyo romantic supernatural series Vampire Host (\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u30db\u30b9\u30c8\u3000\uff5e\u591c\u578b\u611b\u4eba\u5c02\u9580\u5e97\uff5e) which was broadcast from April to June 2004. She also starred in a very different role as the female sword fighter Sayuri in the period action drama Ranbu: Enbu kenshi (\uff32\uff21\uff2e\uff22\uff35 \u8276\u821e\u5263\u58eb), which reached theaters in November 2004.\nIn addition to modeling and acting, Komukai also appeared at Japanese video game events and eventually became acquainted with Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, appearing as a guest on his HIDECHAN! Radio show in 2006.\n\n\n=== Drug problems ===\nIn September 2008, Komukai's agent R.I.P. (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7) announced that they were cancelling her exclusive contract because her poor health, mental instability and absences for the past few years had made it impossible for them to continue their support. In November of that same year, Komukai stirred the gravure world with her allegations that the industry was full of seedy types who attempt to solicit prostitution work out of the models although she denied any participation in prostitution activities herself. In January 2009, she was arrested on drug charges. She was convicted in Tokyo District Court in February 2009 of drug law violations for using methamphetamines and was sentenced to 18 months in prison suspended for three years. At the trial Komukai said she had been using drugs since mid-2007 under coercion from the man she had been dating. Komukai published a tell-all autobiography in November 2009 titled I'm Really Sorry (\u3044\u3063\u3071\u3044\u3001\u3054\u3081\u3093\u30cd\u3002, Ippai, gomen ne) (ISBN 978-4198628581) in which she talks about dropping out of high school, early sexual activity and her drug problems.\nKomukai starred in the 2010 Toei film Flower and Snake 3 (\u82b1\u3068\u86c7\uff13, Hana to hebi 3) directed by Yusuke Narita. This was a sequel to Toei's sadomasochistic-themed 2004 film Flower and Snake, which was itself a remake of the classic 1974 version (Flower and Snake). The Japan Times reviewer's opinion of her acting abilities was not flattering. In 2010, Komukai started a career as a stripper.\nWhen Tokyo police broke up a group of Japanese and Iranian drug dealers in October 2010, they found Komukai's name listed as a customer and in February 2011, they issued a warrant for her arrest. Komukai had left Japan by this time and was in Manila. In a February 14 interview in Manila, she denied the drug allegations, said she was \"not afraid of getting arrested\" and would soon be returning to Japan. Komukai was arrested for a second time on drug charges for alleged possession of methamphetamines at Tokyo's Narita International Airport when she returned from Manila on February 25, 2011. In March 2011, Komukai, who denied she was a customer of the drug gang, was released due to lack of evidence.\n\n\n=== AV debut ===\nIn October 2011 she entered the adult video (AV) industry as an exclusive actress for the company Alice Japan with the video AV Actress Minako Komukai. It was reported that she was being paid 100 million yen (nearly US$1 million) for a five-film contract. Her AV debut film was a huge commercial success, selling over 200.000 copies in a field where 10,000 copies constitute a hit. In early 2012 with AV sales generally declining due to internet competition, other adult studios were also looking to sign big names from other areas of entertainment, a so-called \"Minako Komukai effect.\" Komukai began appearing in videos for a new studio, Moodyz, in July 2014. Her first video for Moodyz, titled Anal Bukkake Fuck Now!, won the Grand Prix award and the Super Heavyweight Class First Place award at the AV Open 2014 competition in November 2014.\n\n\n=== More drug problems ===\nIn February 2015, Komukai was arrested for drug possession for the third time. The arrest, made by narcotics officers at her apartment in the Ebisu, Shibuya area of Tokyo, was for 0.1 grams of methamphetamine. It was reported that Komukai admitted to the allegations. Friends said that she had seemed distracted since the November AV Open 2014 awards and had cancelled work and taken time off.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Theatrical Films ===\nChain (\u30c1\u30a7\u30fc\u30f3) (2003)\nBakury\u016b Sentai Abaranger Deluxe: Abare Summer Is Freezing Cold!

It was later adapted into an anime OVA and released on April 5, 1991 by Aubec.\nThe story mostly takes place on an Earthlike world, an other-dimensional planet from which the Earth (the \"Capricorn\" of the title) can occasionally be glimpsed in the sky. The planet's inhabitants, ruled by a decadent king, are almost all intelligent, anthropomorphic animals; one exception is the human-looking Mona, a young and adventurous woman. Mona's scholarly friend, an elderly anthropomorphic mouse, becomes caught up in a conspiracy to replace the monarchy with a military dictatorship. Against this backdrop, two young Japanese suddenly materialise on the planet: the high-school student Taku Shimamura and his sister Tamaki.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCapricorn (manga) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia\nCapricorn (OVA) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia",

            "content": "The Canal du Rh\u00f4ne au Rhin is one of the important watershed canals of the French waterways, connecting the Rhine to the Sa\u00f4ne and the Rh\u00f4ne and thereby the North Sea and the Mediterranean. As built, the canal was made up of four distinct sections:\nthe branche Sud or southern branch, 224 km from the Sa\u00f4ne just north of Saint-Jean-de-Losne to the \u00cele Napol\u00e9on basin and junction just east of Mulhouse,\nthe branche Nord or northern branch, 134 km from the Mulhouse junction to the Dusuzeau basin in the port of Strasbourg,\nthe 22-km-long Canal de Huningue, from the junction to the Rhine at Huningue, just north from the Swiss port of Basle,\nthe 10-km-long Belfort branch, which when built was to be the first section of the Canal de Montb\u00e9liard \u00e0 la Haute-Sa\u00f4ne.\nDevelopments for high-capacity navigation in the second half of the 20th century thoroughly transformed this Y-shaped system. When the first lock was built on the Grand Canal d'Alsace at Kembs, a new cut was also excavated from Kembs to Niffer, and the rest of the Canal de Huningue was upgraded from here to the docks at Mulhouse. A 3-km-long section of the former Canal de Huningue, from Niffer to Kembs, is maintained and gives access to a boat harbour, while the remainder of that canal to Basel has been closed, and the terminal basin transformed into a whitewater canoeing course.\nMost of the northern branch was abandoned, and in the early 1980s the A36 motorway sliced through the canal embankment east of Mulhouse. Two sections were maintained and new cuts built from the Rhine to make them accessible:\nthe Colmar Canal or embranchement de Colmar 23 km long, from a new lock at Neuf-Brisach to Colmar,\na 34 km lateral canal starting from a new entrance lock at Rhinau and finishing in the basins of the port of Strasbourg.\nA further major upheaval, planned from the 1960s, was construction of a high-capacity waterway to connect the Rh\u00f4ne-Sa\u00f4ne corridor with the main European waterway network. This project was abandoned by Environment Minister Dominique Voynet in 1997.\nThe section from Mulhouse to Neuf-Brisach is abandoned, while the 29 km section between Artzenheim and Friesenheim has been partially restored by Alsace Region, but works were stopped in 2009 for financial reasons. A cycle path was built along this section in 2011, extending the popular cycle path south from Strasbourg.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first section of the Canal de Franche-Comt\u00e9 was authorised by Burgundy Council in 1783 and completed in 1802 from the Sa\u00f4ne to D\u00f4le. Napoleon was seeking to develop inland waterway connections throughout the country, and the Rh\u00f4ne-Rhine link was of such strategic importance that he gave his name to the project. The Emperor\u2019s administration conceived the predecessor of today\u2019s public-private partnership model, selling existing canals to private companies, to provide funds for new links. The proceeds were diverted for the war effort, and it was not until 1821 that this project, now renamed \u2018Canal Monsieur\u2019, was reactivated by the canal company set up for this purpose. Works were completed in 1833. Upgrading to Freycinet standards started in 1882, and the summit level was lowered, reducing the number of locks. The new high-capacity Rhine-Rh\u00f4ne waterway would have made the canal obsolete, but the environment minister Dominique Voynet cancelled that project in 1997.

            "content": "Karthik Calling Karthik is a 2010 Indian psychological thriller film, written and directed by Vijay Lalwani and produced by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani under the banner of Excel Entertainment and Reliance Big Pictures. The film stars Farhan Akhtar and Deepika Padukone in lead roles. Ram Kapoor and Shefali Shah play supporting roles in the film. The film's music was composed by the trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, while the background score was composed by MIDIval Punditz and Karsh Kale.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nKarthik (Farhan Akhtar) is an introvert who lacks confidence and feels trapped in his average job at a construction company. He is continuously troubled by an incident from his childhood: His older brother, Kumar, used to torture him, but whenever he complained to his parents, they did not believe him. One day, Kumar took Karthik to a well and tried to throw him in it, but Karthik escaped. Kumar accidentally fell inside the well and died. Karthik has thought himself responsible for his brother's death ever since.\nShonali Mukherjee (Deepika Padukone) is a co-worker at Karthik's company, whom Karthik secretly loved though she remains unaware of his existence, much less his feelings. After being derided by his boss Mr Kamath (Ram Kapoor) yet again; Karthik figures his life can\u2019t get any worse and decides to commit suicide. Just as he is about to, a stranger with the same, exact voice as his, calls and says that he is also Karthik, convincing him that he has the ability to change his life. These phone calls become Karthik's life guide. His chats take place every morning at 5:00 a.m. and the caller provides advice on Karthik's problems, guiding him to become a successful man, win Shonali's heart, and bring color to his otherwise dreary life.\nHowever, when Karthik tells Shonali and his psychiatrist about the phone calls, despite being warned not to, the mysterious caller gets angry and tells Karthik that if he could bring him up, he could also throw him down. As per his word, things start going downhill. Karthik's boss throws him out and Shonali leaves him. Karthik decides that if he goes somewhere he does not know, then the caller wouldn't know where he is either and stop calling him. Karthik travels to an unknown place, takes shelter in a small hotel, and asks the receptionist to remove the telephone and room number plate.\nAfter a few months, Karthik is comfortably living in Cochin with a decent job. His life is back to normal except for the fact that he refuses to have a phone line. Upon his boss's request, he is forced to purchase a landline. He goes to great lengths to ensure that he himself is unaware of the phone number. However, one day at exactly 5 a.m, he receives a call from the mysterious caller, who threatens to kill him. Meanwhile, Shonali is contacted by Dr. Kapadia, who reveals the twist: Karthik actually suffers from Schizophrenia. He has an alter-ego that is more assertive and advises him on how to live life. However it was revealed that the strange caller was Karthik himself. He has been dealing with this condition from a young age, when he created a fake brother named Kumar with his imagination. Karthik's phone has the capacity to record messages and act as a playback feature at a certain time. Karthik would wake up in the middle of the night, leave himself messages as his alter ego, and return to sleep, where he would awake once again at 5 AM to take his own calls.\nEventually, Karthik Narayan becomes so disturbed that he attempts to commit suicide again. Shonali, realizing the truth, arrives at the right time to save him. They reconcile and she stands by him, helping him with his condition. After a few months, Karthik is in the process of dealing with his disorder and lives a happy and rehabilitated life with Shonali by his side.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nFarhan Akhtar as Karthik Narayan\nDeepika Padukone as Shonali Mukharjee\nRam Kapoor as Kamath\nShefali Shah as Dr. Shweta Kapadia\nVivan Bhatena as Ashish\nVipin Sharma as Landlord\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn an effort to prepare for his role as loner introvert Karthik, Farhan Akhtar isolated himself at home and school and turned off his phone.

The poem is the fourth to be delivered at a United States presidential inauguration, following in the tradition of recitals by Robert Frost (John F. Kennedy, 1961), Maya Angelou (Bill Clinton, 1993), and Miller Williams (Bill Clinton, 1997).\nIt consists of fourteen unrhymed three-line stanzas (tercets) and a one-line coda. Delivered directly after Obama's inaugural address, it received a lukewarm response and was criticized as \"too prosaic.\" Graywolf Press published the poem in paperback 6 February 2009, with a first printing of 100,000 copies.\nOne critic called the poem \"public in the worst sense--inauthentic, bureaucratic, rhetorical.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nPoems at United States presidential inaugurations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nText of the poem\nVideo of the poem's recitation",

            "content": "Kingsley Adeseye Ogunlewe, alias Omoba, is a Nigerian nobleman and politician who was elected a national Senator on the Alliance for Democracy (AD) platform 1999 for the Lagos East constituency, before he defected to the PDP. He later became the Minister of Works (July 2003 to March 2006). When he was sacked from this position by President Olusegun Obasanjo, it was said to be due to a feud with his former patron, Bode George, the Deputy National Chairman of the PDP.\n\n\n== Background ==\nOgunlewe is from an affluent dynasty of Igbogbo, a community in the Ikorodu Local Government Area of Lagos State. His elder brother, Dr. Akin Ogunlewe, was a permanent secretary in the Federal Ministry of Commerce and Industry, who was relieved of his position soon after Ogunlewe transferred to the PDP.\nOgunlewe is an alumnus of the University of Ibadan. During his stay in the premier University he lived in Mellanby Hall and participated actively in students politics. He is a lawyer, and at one time was permanent secretary of Lagos State.\n\n\n== Senator ==\nIn July 2002, Senator Wahab Dosunmu and Adeseye Ogunlewe accused Lagos State Governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu of abusing trust of public funds through contract awards to his friends.\nHe ran for reelection in 2003 on the PDP ticket, but was defeated by Olorunnimbe Mamora of the Alliance for Democracy (AD).\n\n\n== Minister of works ==\nIn July 2003, Adeseye Ogunlewe announced that the federal government would invest about US$2.85 billion in rehabilitating and upgrading the nation's highway network, and planned to make all roads in the country accessible by year end. In January 2004, Adeseye Ogunlewe said the Federal government had approved an extra N900 million for rehabilitation of roads in the South-east.\nIn April 2004, Adeseye Ogunlewe won the Dr Kwame Nkrumah Africa Leadership Award in Accra, Ghana. In May 2004, Ogunlewe published his mobile phone number and told people to use it if they saw any pot-holes or had a traffic accident. He said he was inundated with calls, but also said of the roads \"They are fantastic now.\" He claimed that 12,600 km of roads had been rehabilitated in the past six months.\nIn June 2004 there were clashes in Lagos state between agents of the Federal Ministry of Works and officials of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority. The clashes were over control of Federal roads, and were apparently linked to ongoing disputes between Ogunlewe and the state governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the Alliance for Democracy.\nIn August 2004, Ogunlewe announced that The World Bank and the African Development Bank planned to cooperate with Nigeria to build the Trans-West African Highway from Lagos to Mauritania's capital Nouakchott. In October 2004, Adeseye Ogunlewe stated that the year 2005 would see faster rapid progress in road repair and construction.\nIn March 2006, after being dismissed from his job as Works Minister, Adeseye Ogunlewe urged President Olusegun Obasanjo to seek a third term of office.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nIn July 2006, a Lagos State governorship candidate Funsho Williams was found murdered in his home. Adeseye Ogunlewe, who had been a rival for the PDP nomination, was arrested in connection with the murder. He was later released, but in February 2007 he was re-arrested.\nIn November 2009, the Senate ad hoc committee on transport led by Heineken Lokpobiri, submitted a report to the upper house that revealed \"alleged serial malpractices\" in road contracting over a ten-year period, and recommended that former ministers of works Anthony Anenih, Adeseye Ogunlewe, Obafemi Anibaba, Cornelius Adebayo and others be prosecuted for corruption. Senate discussion of the report was delayed.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The National Herbarium of the Netherlands (Dutch: Nationaal Herbarium Nederland) is one of largest herbaria in the world with some 5.5 million specimens. It was established in 1999 through a decentralized merger of the major university herbaria of Leiden (also known as the Rijksherbarium), Utrecht and Wageningen. Each of the three had its own focus.\nThe National Herbarium currently consists of two branches:\nLeiden University\nWageningen University and Research centre.\nThe Utrecht herbarium has been closed and in 2009 its stock was transferred to Leiden, where it is curated by the Naturalis Biodiversity Centre. It is planned that Naturalis (the Netherlands' Natural History Museum and Centre for Biodiversity) will run the National Herbarium.\nThe NHN coordinates several flora projects. \"Flora Malesiana\" and \"Flora of the Guianas\" have their seat in Leiden, while the \"Flore du Benin\" and \"Flore du Gabon\" are coordinated from Wageningen. Herbaria of several classic botanists are in the collections, e.g.\nDavid de Gorter\n\n\n== Access ==\nThe Herbarium is open to any visitor, professional or amateur, with a legitimate reason to consult the collections. The specimen database is available through Brahms online: Specimen database.\n\n\n== Directors ==\nWhen the National Herbarium was formed in 1999 Pieter Baas, former director of the Rijksherbarium of Leiden University, became the director. He was succeeded in 2005 by Erik Smets.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlumea (journal)\nCornelis Gijsbert Gerrit Jan van Steenis\nHortus Botanicus Leiden\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNational Herbarium of the Netherlands",
