            "content": "South Salt Lake is a city in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States and is part of the Salt Lake City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 23,617 at the 2010 census.\n\n\n== History ==\nIncorporated in 1938, South Salt Lake celebrated its 75th-year Diamond Anniversary in 2013. Nestled among and often confused for neighboring larger cities, it is close to everything from golf courses to a downtown night life while still maintaining its small town feel. Some of Utah's best ski resorts are about a 30-minute drive and downtown Salt Lake City is only several minutes away. South Salt Lake offers mass transportation, various housing types; parochial, charter, and public schools; city parks, and one of the most diverse populations in Utah.Originally, South Salt Lake was made up of three distinct unincorporated areas: Millcreek to the north, Central Park and Southgate to the south. In 1936 Central Park incorporated as its own town.\n\nJesse Fox Jr. developed the area South Salt Lake refers to as Central Park around 1890. It runs approximately from State Street to 300 East and 2500 South to 3000 South.\nMr. Fox chose the name after visiting New York and seeing Central Park there. He was impressed by the park, and the urban planning. He wanted his development to be related to the status of the Central Park in New York. South Salt Lake was a rural place at the time but he was so impressed at what he saw back east, he wanted to make a connection to the development here.\nA few of the street names in the neighborhood have a connection to Mr. Fox. He had a daughter named Esther Vidas Fox, and another named Lucy Beryl Fox. There was no daughter named Leslie. However, there was a close relative, Lester Fox who went by Leslie and so Leslie Avenue is named after him.\nIn 1925 the LDS Central Park Ward was created and named after the development. On August 14, 1936 a resolution creating the Town of Central Park was approved by the Board of County Commissioners. There were 37 pages of signatures in favor of incorporating the town. \"On or about July 15, 1937, one-fourth or more of the legal voters of said Town of Central Park, Utah\" petitioned to disincorporate the town. On November 2, 1937, 1013 votes were cast, 731 were for the dis-incorporation. Almost a year later the Town of South Salt Lake was established in September 1938.\nThe property formerly known as Woodrow Wilson Elementary was renamed Central Park Community Center to reflect the history in the area. It boasts a ball diamond, a playground, a Head Start Pre-School, and the Pete Suazo Boxing Gym. Every day you can see kids playing soccer, or baseball, animal lovers with their dogs, joggers and families enjoying the open space.\nOn Thursday, September 29, 1938 a meeting was called to order at 8:30 p.m. by Robert R. Fitts. Also in attendance at this meeting were Alma Kasteler, A.S. Dykman, Clyde H. Peck, and Ariel A. Jensen. The official resolution as passed by Salt Lake County creating the Town of South Salt Lake and appointing the first town board was read. Board members took their oath before Justice Herman Gygi. And so it began, The Town of South Salt Lake with Mr. Fitts as the first town president. The town was created because of a need for a sewer system. Salt Lake City was going to annex the area in 1936 but couldn't get a sewer system to the area for several years. According to Mr. Fitts the community needed other things as well, like a bank, post office and fire department. After a close vote, residents approved incorporation. The sewer system was a Works Project Administration project. The deadline to file the sewer system plans was two days after the city was incorporated. The project began in 1939 at a cost of $462,000.\nThe original boundary of South Salt Lake was from 5th East to 3rd West and 2100 South to the center of Millcreek stream. Over the years the population grew, businesses came, and schools were built. On August 1, 1950 the population was such that the Town of South Salt Lake became the City of South Salt Lake and declared a third class city by the county. This changed the form of government to a mayor and city council. During his administration, Marlow Callahan went from Town President to the first mayor of The City of South Salt Lake.\nIn the 1990s, South Salt Lake annexed portions of an unincorporated portion of Salt Lake County to the south, and nearly doubled in land area, and, as a result, population.\n\nThe current mayor is Cherie Wood. Mayor Wood is a lifelong resident of the City of South Salt Lake, and began her career with the city 17 years ago at the front counter processing utility payments. Previously Assistant Mayor to Mayor Robert Gray. Cherie graduated from the University of Phoenix with dual bachelor's degrees in Business Management and Business Administration. Wood became South Salt Lake's first female mayor on January 4, 2010. Mayor Wood was voted Best of State Elected Official in 2012 and 2013. She was featured in a commercial for the University of Phoenix as part of their Icon Campaign. She was featured in Yahoo's Shine channel and was Utah Business Magazine's one of 30 Women to Watch in 2008.\nIn 2012, a Chinatown development started to open businesses on a lot in the city. It will be the only Chinatown in the Intermountain West. Currently there are three Chinese restaurants, a gift shop, a martial-arts facility, and an Asian convenience store operating, while construction has begun on a large Chinese supermarket on the property.[8]\nIn 2017, after nearly 7 years of planning, ground was broken on a new mixed-use development known as The Crossing (formerly called Market Station) between State St. and Main St. just south of 2100 South. This development will be oriented around mass transit, with an S-Line streetcar stop adjacent to the development, and 1 stop away from the Central Pointe TRAX Station. The first phase will include a WinCo Foods and two multi-family housing buildings with a total of 250 residential units. This is the first phase of a \"downtown\" South Salt Lake development plan that is ultimately planned to have 2,500 family housing units, 1.5 million square feet of retail, 3 million square feet of office and commercial space, and additional greenspace and trails.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 6.9 square miles (18 km2), all land.\nThe city is bordered by the Jordan River on the west, 500 East and 700 East on the east, 2100 South on the north, and 3900 South on the south. West Valley City lies to the west, Salt Lake City to the north and northeast, and Millcreek to the east and south. Because of its location next to the Jordan River and well away from the mountains, it is mostly flat, only ranging in elevation from about 4,330 feet (1,320 m) to 4,380 feet (1,340 m).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 23,617 people, 9,160 housing units, with a total of 8,554 households . The population density was 3,401.1 people per square mile (1,231.4/km\u00b2)with a land area of 6.94 miles. The racial makeup of the city was 69.5% White, 4.4% African American, 2.6% Native American, 5.0% Asian, 1.0% Pacific Islander, and 4.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race was 29.1% of the population.\nThere were 8,554 households out of which 26.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 33% were married couples living together, 14.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.2% were non-family house holds. 34% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 3.24.\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 77.8% over the age of 18, 11.5% from 20 to 24, 12.5% from 25 to 29, 6.1% from 45 to 49, and 6.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.3 years. For every 100 females there were 121.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 127.1 males.\nThe median income for a household in the city was $35,547 and the median income for a family was $37,632. Males had a median income of $27,432 versus $22,275 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,786. According to US Census Bureau data, the number of persons below the poverty level in 2009-2013 was 29.7%, over twice the Utah average.\n\n\n=== Chinatown ===\nAccording to the Deseret News, ground breaking on the new Chinatown occurred in 2011 for a Chinese-themed shopping mall with a \"... 27,000 square foot Asian grocery store, 65,000 square foot indoor mall including 38 Asian-themed shops and 12,000 square feet Asian-themed strip mall\". The strip mall is now open. Margaret Yee, a 1962 graduate said that \"... 10,000-plus Chinese nationals living in the area have wanted [a Chinatown] for a long time....\" By late 2012, the Chinatown has experienced an upsurge of Chinese immigrants and the businesses are now filling up the Chinatown.\n\n\n== Crime ==\n\nSince 2007, crime in South Salt Lake has been reduced by 30%. Former SSL Police Chief Chris Snyder attributes the drop in crime to 4 factors: 1) Increased attention to code enforcement, 2) Crime Free Rental Housing program that results in greater landlord scrutiny of potential renters, 3) Partnerships, such as that with United Way of Salt Lake, combined with community organizing, such as the Promise South Salt Lake initiative, South Salt Lake Community Connection that address resident needs and improve neighborhoods, and 4) Extensive youth development efforts, such as Promise afterschool programs delivered in nine Neighborhood Centers across the city, and urban/neighborhood revitalization projects. There is a new emphasis on redevelopment (including the Market Station development) and a reduction in the number of liquor licenses allowed to be issued is anticipated to reduce crime in the city.\nThe Motovo Real Estate Blog ranked South Salt Lake as the \"Most Dangerous Place in Utah\" citing data from the 2012 FBI Uniform Crime Report. Their report found that South Salt Lake had the most violent crimes per capita in Utah, with the second highest non-violent crime rate as well.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nI-15, I-80, and SR-201 intersect in the northwestern portion of the city. This interchange is known locally as the \"Spaghetti Bowl\" due to its complex array of on and off ramps, which extend to several other city roads in the area. US-89 runs north-to-south along State Street through the heart of South Salt Lake, serving as the primary commercial corridor and includes an interchange at I-80. SR-171 (3300 South) traverses the city east-to-west, with an interchange at I-15. SR-71 (South 700 East) runs along the southern part of the east border of the city and also has an interchange at I-80.\n\nUtah Transit Authority's (UTA) TRAX light rail runs through the city at about 200 West, with 3 stations located within the city limits. All three of the TRAX lines (Blue, Red, and Green) enter the city from the north at Central Pointe station. (The UTA Police Department was located at the Central Pointe station until it moved to its new location at the Murray Central station in July 2016.) From Central Pointe station the Green Line heads west to West Valley City while both the Blue and Red lines continue south to stop at the Millcreek station before leaving the city just south of the Meadowbrook station. UTA also has several local bus routes that run through the city, many of which stop every fifteen minutes.\nIn December 2013, the S Line streetcar (formerly known as Sugar House Streetcar) opened for service. The S Line was built along an existing rail line just south of 2100 South (the northern border of the city) from the Central Pointe station to the Sugar House neighborhood in southeastern Salt Lake City. In addition to Central Pointe station, the S Line will include stops at South Main Street (South Salt Lake City station), South 300 East (300 East station), and South 500 East (500 East station) before leaving the city. Although operated by UTA, the S Line is a joint project between South Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, and UTA.\n\n\n== Sites ==\nOne of South Salt Lake's most notable and historic buildings is the Columbus Center. Originally a school around the turn of the 20th century, it was later used as a daycare center beginning in the 1950s. After being condemned in the late 1980s, it was renovated and expanded to include a branch of the Salt Lake County Library System as well as an auditorium, senior center and several other facilities.\n\n\n== Education ==\nSouth Salt Lake lies within the Granite School District. The city is served by three public elementary schools (Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Roosevelt) (pre K-6th grade), and one junior high school (Granite Park Junior High). With Mayor Wood's emphasis on education, two charter schools have located in South Salt Lake, Alianza (K-8) and the Utah International Charter School (7-12). The Salt Lake City campus of Broadview University is located next to the South Salt Lake city offices, and the city also has strong ties and partnerships with local institutions of higher education, Salt Lake Community College and Westminster College. Utah State University has a satellite campus located within the Granite District Offices at 2500 South State Street, also in South Salt Lake.\n\n\n== Trivia ==\n\nEdwin Catmull, President of Pixar, graduated from Granite High in South Salt Lake in 1963.\nThe world's first Kentucky Fried Chicken (now KFC) franchise was established in 1952 by Harland Sanders and Pete Harman in what is now part of South Salt Lake.\nZagg, manufacturer and marketer of the popular invisibleSHIELD gadget protection film, is based in South Salt Lake.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSouth Salt Lake official website\nSalt Lake Chinatown official website",

            "content": "Songcatcher is a 2000 drama film directed by Maggie Greenwald. It is about a musicologist researching and collecting Appalachian folk music in the mountains of western North Carolina. Although Songcatcher is a fictional film, it is loosely based on the work of Olive Dame Campbell, founder of the John C. Campbell Folk School in Brasstown, North Carolina, and that of the English folk song collector Cecil Sharp, portrayed at the end of the film as professor Cyrus Whittle.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1907, Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer), a professor of musicology, is denied a promotion at the university where she teaches. She impulsively visits her sister Eleanor (Jane Adams), who runs a struggling rural school in Appalachia. There, she discovers a treasure trove of traditional Scots Irish ballads, which have been preserved by the secluded mountain people since the colonial period of the 1600s and 1700s. Lily decides to record and transcribe the songs and share them with the outside world.\nWith the help of a musically talented orphan named Deladis Slocumb (Emmy Rossum), Lily ventures into isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs. She finds herself increasingly enchanted, not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harsh conditions. She becomes privy to their struggles to save their land from Earl Giddens (David Patrick Kelly), representative of a coal mining company. At the same time, Lily is troubled when she finds that Eleanor is engaged in a lesbian love affair with her co-teacher at the school.\nLily meets Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn), a handsome, hardened war veteran and talented musician. Despite some initial resentment, she soon begins a love affair with him. She experiences a slow change in both her perception of the mountain people as savage and uncouth, and of her sister's sexuality as immoral. Hoping to help share the culture of the mountain people with the wider world, Lily convinces Clementine McFarland (Rhoda Griffis), an art collector, to purchase a painting done by a local woman.\nEvents come to a crisis when a young man discovers Eleanor and her lover, Harriet, kissing in the woods. That night, two men set fire to the school building, burning Eleanor, Harriet, and Deladis out of their home and destroying Lily's transcriptions of the ballads and her phonograph recordings. Rather than starting over again, Lily decides to leave, but she convinces Tom and Deladis to \"go down the mountain\" with her to make and sell phonograph recordings of mountain music. As they depart, Cyrus Whittle, a renowned professor from England, arrives on a collection foray of his own, ensuring that the ballads will be preserved in the manner that Lily had originally intended.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nThe character of Viney Butler was based on Mary Jane Queen, whom Greenwald consulted when researching the film.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe film's score was written by David Mansfield, who also assembled a roster of female country music artists to perform mostly traditional mountain ballads. Some of the songs are contemporary arrangements, and some are played in the traditional Appalachian music style. The artists include Rosanne Cash, Emmylou Harris, Maria McKee, Dolly Parton, Gillian Welch and Patty Loveless. Singers Emmy Rossum, Iris DeMent, and Hazel Dickens, who appeared in the film, are also featured on the soundtrack.\nThe soundtrack album inspired the 2002 follow-up album by Vanguard Records, Songcatcher II: The Tradition That Inspired the Movie, that compiled recordings of some of the songs selected for the film as performed by authentic Appalachian artists. The recordings are mostly from the 1960s, out of the Vanguard vaults.\n\n\n=== Track listing ===\n\"Fair and Tender Ladies\" (Traditional, performed by Rosanne Cash) \u2013 2:56\n\"Pretty Saro\" (Traditional, performed by Iris DeMent) \u2013 2:54\n\"When Love Is New\" (Composed and performed by Dolly Parton) \u2013 5:16\n\"Barbara Allen\" (Traditional, performed by Emmy Rossum) \u2013 0:43\n\"Barbara Allen\" (Traditional, performed by Emmylou Harris) \u2013 4:35\n\"Moonshiner\" (Traditional, performed by Allison Moorer) \u2013 3:34\n\"Sounds of Loneliness\" (Composed by Patty Ramey, performed by Patty Loveless) \u2013 3:44\n\"All My Tears\" (Composed and performed by Julie Miller) \u2013 3:11\n\"Mary of the Wild Moor\" (Traditional, performed by Sara Evans) \u2013 3:51\n\"Wayfaring Stranger (Traditional, Maria McKee) \u2013 3:24\n\"Wind and Rain\" (Traditional, performed by Gillian Welch and David Rawlings) \u2013 3:25\n\"The Cuckoo Bird\" (Traditional, performed by Deana Carter) \u2013 3:33\n\"Score Suite # 1\" (Composed by David Mansfield) \u2013 5:01\n\"Conversation With Death\" (Traditional, performed by Hazel Dickens) \u2013 3:01\n\"Score Suite # 2\" (Composed by David Mansfield) \u2013 4:58\n\"Single Girl\" (Traditional, performed by Pat Carroll) \u2013 1:04\n\n\n=== Chart performance ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDorothy Scarborough, A Song Catcher in Southern Mountains: American Folk Songs of British Ancestry.

            "content": "Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All is a 1982 animated television film produced by Filmation and written by Samuel A. Peeples, whose credits included the original Star Trek series.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring World War II, Flash Gordon is on a mission in Warsaw, which is suffering heavy bombing. He arrives too late and his contact, who is near death, says he has a message for Doctor Zarkov, but can utter only one word, \"Mongo\", before he dies.\nFlash travels to find Zarkov and meets feisty 'girl reporter' Dale Arden, also on her way to interview him. They are bombarded by meteorites, which damage their plane and force them to bail out. On the ground they flee lava flows, and find a secret cave and a rocket ship. Doctor Zarkov, having no time for introductions, ushers them on board and they blast off. When safely in flight, he explains he is on a mission to the wandering planet Mongo to convince their leaders to call off their attack on Earth (by force if necessary, using a gravity weapon of his own invention). For their part, Flash and Dale agree to help him.\nBefore they can make contact, hostile ships shoot them down, and they make a crash landing. After barely surviving attack by two clashing dinosaurian monsters, they are captured by animalistic savages and dragged to a giant idol to be sacrificed. They barely escape to the outside, where they meet the virtuous King Thun of the Lion Men and help him escape Amazonian hunters led by Princess Aura.0p\nFlash and company are forced into war against Mongo's leader and Aura's dad, the maniacal Emperor Ming, and his robotic army of Metal Men. To help their cause, the heroes lead an alliance formed from freedom fighters led by King Thun, as well as Prince Barin of Arboria; and King Vultan of the Hawkmen.\nThun explains Ming is too clever to conquer Earth by force alone, and that he would use the Mongo strategy of 'separate and attack' which Flash notes is the same as the Earth expression 'divide and conquer'. Ming reveals he has secretly given military technology to Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party.\nMing sends his Mole Men to attack the kingdom of Arboria by destroying the roots of the trees of the forested land which provides camoflauge. Thanks to Zarkov warning Flash and friends, the attack is repulsed and Flash and his allies use the captured drilling machine to attack Ming's palace. They are overwhelmed by Ming's forces, but Prince Barin insists on his right to a trial by strength. With a flaming sword and a ion blaster in hand, Ming duels against Flash in an epic fight.... and switches with a robotic copy to flee when near defeat..\nAs the planet Mongo approaches Earth, they are rocked by earthquakes threatening to destabilize both planets. To avert the destruction of Earth, they destroy the engine that propels Mongo through space, knowing that without it they will drift though space unable to return to Earth again.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nRobert Ridgely as Flash Gordon\nDiane Pershing as Dale Arden\nVic Perrin as Ming the Merciless\nBob Holt as Dr. Hans Zarkov\nDavid Opatoshu as Prince Vultan\nMelendy Britt as Princess Aura\nRobert Douglas as Prince Barin\nTed Cassidy as Prince Thun\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe original project was produced by Filmation as a made-for-television feature film, partly as a reaction to the mammoth success of Star Wars in 1977. When NBC saw the finished work, it was decided to turn the work into what became the 1979 Saturday-morning animated TV-series Flash Gordon.\nAlthough the film was developed before the 1979 animated series began, it did not premiere on NBC until 1983. It was shown in the UK on ITV 22 December at 10:25am 1983. In fact, some scenes from the film were used in promotional spots for the coming series the summer before the series began in the fall of 1979. While Filmation's TV-series has become available on DVD, the TV-movie has never become commercially available even to this day, except from occasional off-air bootlegs. The only known commercial releases were by VAP Video in Japan (catalog #67019-128), c. 1983, in both laser disc and NTSC VHS videotape formats and in Bulgaria, where it was released on VHS. The movie also aired numerous times on the \"Diema\" Channel in the late 1990s. In the Japanese release, it is presented uncut with the original English voice track, with Japanese subtitles added for its intended audience. At the end of the movie is a trailer for the De Laurentiis live-action movie, as well as trailers for other titles from the VAP Video library at the time. The covers for both versions feature comic-strip panels, using stills taken from the movie. Its last listing was in VAP Video's catalog for 1983.\nApart from the subplot involving Ming passing advanced weapons to Hitler, which is not touched upon in the later animated series, there are several other notable differences that seem to indicate that this animated film was intended for prime time, when parents presumably would be watching also. Those differences include:\n- The departure of the trio from Earth to Mongo is depicted. In order to make Zarkov sympathetic from the start, the original story element of him forcing Flash and Dale to board his rocket is changed to him inviting them in when they flee into his hidden laboratory/launch site, threatened by flooding molten lava. In this case, Zarkov's rocket is their only chance of survival and they board without hesitation with Zarkov's apologies that he cannot drop them off before continuing to Mongo. For their part, Flash and Dale understand Zarkov's mission and quickly agree to help him.\n- The use of 1939 terrestrial firearms by Flash and Zarkov upon arrival while battling a monster.\n- A discussion between Flash and Thun indicating that Ming's Lizard Woman overseers eat human prisoners.\n- Mongian firearms that look much more like their terrestrial counterparts than those used in the animated series.\n- The clear destruction of the Hawkmen's sky city, whereas in the series it is only captured.\n- More revealing costumes, as Flash and Dale Arden's terrestrial clothing gradually disintegrates as well as Zarkov's to a lesser extent upon Mongo. After they are captured by Ming's forces, Dale spends the majority of her time in a belly-dancer-like costume in Ming's harem while Flash does not receive his red and blue uniform until the last 20 minutes of the film.\n- Clear reference to killing prior to the final fight between Ming and Flash, as Barin, Vultan and Thun claim their right under the laws of Mongo to trial by combat before they can be put to death.\n- The final fight between Ming and Flash involves the use of both pistols and swords by both parties, whereas Flash does not use a pistol and loses his sword rapidly in the animated series.\n- Ming's daughter Aura is a much less sympathetic character. The romance between her and Prince Barin is downplayed and, at the end, she refuses to swear allegiance to him as Regent, resulting in him ordering her imprisonment.\n- It is made clear at the end that Flash, Dale and Zarkov will never be able to return to Earth, whereas in the animated series that door is left open.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n Critics consider this movie one of the most faithful adaptations of the original Flash Gordon. This reflects Filmation's respect for the title\u2014in particular that of Filmation's own Lou Schiemer, a fan of the original comics and serials who fought hard to secure the animation rights.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFlash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All on IMDb\nFlash Gordon at Hearst Animation\nViewable copy at Internet Archive",

The addition of silicon to hafnium oxide increases the band gap, while decreasing the dielectric constant. Furthermore, it increases the crystallization temperature of amorphous films and further increases the material's thermal stability with Si at high temperatures. Nitrogen is sometimes added to hafnium silicate for improving the thermal stability and electrical properties of devices.\n\n\n== References ==",

CNT was formed in 1953, with support from the military government of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. CNT was built up along the lines of the Argentinian peronista unions, and CNT was affiliated to the Agrupaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores Latinoamericanos Sindicalistas (ATLAS, which was led by the Peronista unions of Argentina). CNT received financial aid from ATLAS. Moreover, CNT received direct support from the Colombian Ministry of Labour through the minister Aurelio Caicedo Ayerbe. CNT was given access to issue propaganda through public radio stations.\nCNT was actively involved in building the political movement constructed to support the rule of Rojas Pinilla, National Action Movement (MAN). CNT and MAN were projected as the constituents of a 'Third Force' in Colombian politics, confronting the two old dominant parties of the country. With a strong anti-oligarchical discourse, Rojas Pinilla sought to utilize CNT and MAN to mobilize popular opinion against the traditional elites and their political parties.\nAt the same time as the government mobilized support to CNT it curbed the activities of the two main trade union centres of the country, the Liberal Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Colombia and Conservative Uni\u00f3n de Trabajadores Colombianos. The launching of CNT provoked reactions from the opposition side, and a civic opposition front was formed. By the end of 1955 the pressure from the Roman Catholic Church, the Conservatives and UTC forced the government to close down the CNT.\n\n\n== References ==",

He attended the Martin Institute in Jefferson, Georgia, and graduated from the University of Georgia in Athens with a Bachelor of Philosophy in 1877.\nAfter admission to the state bar in 1880, Howard practised law in Lexington, Georgia. He was elected as the solicitor general of Georgia's northern circuit and served in that capacity from 1884 until 1896 when he successfully ran for the United States House of Representatives. He was re-elected to this office six times (1898, 1900, 1902, 1904, 1906 and 1908) before losing the nomination for the 1910 election.\nDuring his last few terms in the U.S. House and for several years after leaving that body, Howard served on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution (1905 through 1912) and was a trustee of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\nPresident Howard Taft appointed Howard to the United States Tariff Board in 1911 and he served in that capacity until 1913. At that time, Howard moved to Augusta, Georgia.\nHoward was appointed to appeal Leo Frank's death sentence after Frank was convicted in the murder of Mary Phagan in 1915. Howard cited flaws in the prosecution's case, including discrepancies in testimony and mishandling of the investigation by Atlanta police, to successfully convince Georgia Gov. John M. Slaton to commute Frank's death sentence to life in prison.\nHoward died in 1932 and was buried in Clarke Cemetery in Lexington.\n\n\n== References ==\nUnited States Congress. \"William Marcellus Howard (id: H000848)\".

She won twice at Group 1 level, following up her Derby win with a victory against fillies later in the season in the Championship Stakes.\nShe won at Group 2 level as a four-year-old, and finished second to Royal Tiara in a photo finish in the 1995 Auckland Cup.\nAs a broodmare, Popsy has been the dam of eight winners, including New Zealand 2000 Guineas winner Rock 'n' Pop and stakes-winner Lilakyn.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The PBA on ESPN 5 (formerly known as the PBA on AKTV and PBA on Sports5) is the presentation of Philippine Basketball Association basketball games which started in the 2011-12 season. Telecasts are produced by ESPN 5 (formerly Sports5), the sports division of TV5 Network Inc., and aired through TV5 and simulcasted through livestreaming at Sports5's official website. Also, there is a separate coverage in English commentary on PBA Rush starting July 15, 2016.\nTV5, which was formerly known as the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC), previously handled the coverage of the games from 2004 to 2008.\n\n\n== Presentation ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\n\n==== 2011-2013 ====\nFrom October 2011 to May 2013, the coverage was known as PBA on AKTV. The games were broadcast on Sports5's AKTV program block on IBC. This was the third time that the PBA aired on IBC. The first was from 1996 to 2002 when Vintage Sports and later Viva Sports handled the television coverage, and the second in 2003, when IBC became one of the two networks (the other being NBN) that covered the PBA.\nGames are being broadcast live and a pre-game and post-game show entitled AKTV Center was added.\n\n\n==== 2013-2014 ====\nAfter TV5 decided not to renew their blocktime agreement with IBC upon its expiration by May 2013 due to high blocktime costs and poor ratings, the broadcast coverage of the 2013 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals was temporarily transferred to TV5 with simulcasts with AksyonTV, the news TV network of TV5.\nSports5 proposed to move the coverage of the PBA games to their sister channel AksyonTV starting with the 2013 PBA Governors' Cup. The league however rejected this move since the contract between them and Sports5 states the league should be aired on a VHF channel. Sports5 then offered to air the second game of a doubleheader playdate on their main TV network TV5, one hour after the first game finishes, with the first game to be aired on a delayed basis after the second game (similar on what Vintage Sports did to the coverage of the PBA Games from 1982 to 1986). However, both games will be aired live on AksyonTV. This proposal was denied by the PBA Board of Governors since this violates the terms of their contract with Sports5.\nThe broadcast of the games returned to IBC for the duration of the 2013 PBA Governors' Cup (up to the semifinal round) as a compromise after the PBA disagreed to Sports5's request to permanently transfer the coverage to TV5 and/or Aksyon TV. The finals series for Governors' Cup were aired live on TV5.\nIn November 2013, Sports5 and Fox Sports Asia have entered in an agreement to air the Wednesday PBA games for the 2013-14 season live on the cable channel. It will have its own English speaking broadcast panel to properly cater the cable channel's audience.\nFor the 2013-14 Philippine Cup eliminations, the games were aired on the following schedule:\nThe schedule for the 2014 PBA Commissioner's Cup has been slightly altered starting March 17, 2014, having the Saturday doubleheader games being aired live on TV5, with a lone game scheduled during Mondays and Wednesdays, to maximize TV5's weekday schedule. As a result, the simulcast at AksyonTV was discontinued. The weekday live airing of the games was returned on starting March 26 after several PBA fans reacted negatively about the delayed airing of the first game. The following schedule was also applied for the 2014 PBA Governors' Cup.\n\n\n==== 2014\u2013present ====\nBeginning with the 2014\u201315 Philippine Cup, all games will be broadcast live on TV5 with simulcasts on AksyonTV and game days (all double headers) will be on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. Provincial games will be held during Saturdays which is the only single header game day. The coverage is also live-streamed via sports5.ph, where pre-game and post-game analysis are also featured. The radio coverage was also transferred to TV5's FM radio network Radyo5 from the previous DZSR AM network.\nThe same schedule is also being followed during the 2015\u201316 season, except that the AksyonTV simulcast was discontinued. When Sports5 got the exclusive airing rights of UFC, they re-activated the previously-dormant Hyper HD channel and began simulcasting the PBA games in HD starting on January 2016.\nTo further utilize the simulcast setup of Sports5, they have assigned a different broadcast panel for TV5 and Hyper/Cignal. TV5 have the Taglish commentary while Hyper/Cignal have English language commentary.\nA separate channel was assigned for PBA broadcasts beginning July 15, 2016 named \"PBA Rush\". The said channel also features game replays and specials.\nOn October 26, 2016, TV5 President and CEO Chot Reyes told the media that the league renewed its contract with Sports5 for three more seasons.\nAs Sports5 inked a partnership with global sports media network ESPN on October 12, the broadcast coverage of the PBA games will be carried over by the new ESPN 5 which will be launched on Game 1 of the 2017 PBA Governors' Cup Finals on October 13.\n\n\n=== High-definition broadcast ===\nSports5 had its first high definition broadcast of the league's games during the finals series of the 2014 PBA Commissioner's Cup. It was aired exclusively to Cignal Digital TV subscribers through a pay per view assigned channel for free. Since then, the HD broadcast has been airing for free on Cignal except during the 2015 Commissioner's and Governors' Cups, which became pay-per-view exclusive. On January 8, 2016, the HD broadcast has been airing on Hyper HD. The HD broadcast was later transferred to the league's exclusive channel in Cignal named \"PBA Rush\".\n\n\n=== On-demand ===\nSports5 uploads all of the games beginning the 2014\u201315 PBA Philippine Cup to their sports5.ph website. Complete videos of the games are also being uploaded on Sports5's YouTube page.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nFor the duration of the 2011-12 Philippine Cup Eliminations, \"Showdown\" by The Black Eyed Peas was used as AKTV's main theme music for the PBA games in addition to the generic sports theme used during halftime and interview segments. A different sports theme music was used starting from the semifinal round of the Philippine Cup. This was still used up to the finals of the 2012 Governors Cup.\nFor the 2012\u201313 PBA season, a theme music entitled \"Kampihan na!\" was used on their on-air presentation. During the Philippine Cup, AKTV used a version of this theme without vocals. The vocals were later added during the elimination round of the Commissioner's Cup and was used until the Governors' Cup. A different theme was introduced during the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds of the Commissioner's Cup entitled \"Tuloy ang Laban\", which was also used sporadically during the Governors' Cup.\nA remixed version of the \"Kampihan na!\" theme was used for the 2013\u201314 season. The remixed theme was used during the Philippine Cup, however a different background music was used for the Commissioner's and Governors' Cups.\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, \"Ito ang Liga\" which was composed by Jungee Marcelo and Thyro Alfaro and interpreted by Ebe Dancel, Sam Concepcion and rapper Gloc-9 is used as the main theme of the league's 40th season. An instrumental version, as well as a different rendition of the song, is used as bed (background music) and on the opening billboard during the coverage.\nA new theme entitled \"Liga ng mga Bida\" performed by Abra and Aya of Project Pilipinas, was introduced for the 2015\u201316 season. It is used as the background and OBB music of the coverage. Generic background music was also used for the 2016 Commissioner's and Governors' Cup and also used during the 2016\u201317 Philippine Cup.\nFor the 2017 Commissioner's Cup, a new theme was introduced entitled \"We Are PBA\" performed by Quest. It is use as the background music of the coverage.\n\n\n=== Broadcast history ===\nAKTV on IBC (October 2, 2011 - May 12, 2013)\nSports5 on IBC (August 14, 2013 - October 7, 2013)\nSports5 on TV5 (May 15\u201319, October 11, 2013 \u2013 October 8, 2017)\nESPN 5 on TV5 (October 13, 2017 - Present)\n\n\n== Pre/post game segments ==\n\n\n== List of broadcasters ==\n\n\n=== TV panel ===\nDon Allado (game analyst: 2016\u2013present)\nChuck Araneta (sideline reporter, play-by-play: 2017\u2013present)\nAaron Atayde (Sports5 Center host, play-by-play: 2011\u2013present)\nCharlie Cuna (play-by-play: 2012\u2013present)\nSelina Dagdag (Sports 360 Blitz host, sideline reporter: 2016\u2013present)\nApple David (Sports5 Center host, sideline reporter: 2014\u2013present)\nMich Del Carmen (sideline reporter, game analyst: 2017\u2013present)\nRizza Diaz (Sports5 Center host, sideline reporter: 2013\u2013present)\nRyan Gregorio (game analyst: 2011\u201313, 2014\u2013present)\nSel Guevara (sideline reporter: 2011-2013, 2014\u2013present)\nQuinito Henson (game analyst: 2011\u2013present)\nAndy Jao (game analyst: 2014\u2013present)\nCarla Lizardo (Sports5 Center host, sideline reporter: 2014\u2013present)\nChino Lui Pio (Sports5 Center host: 2016\u2013present)\nMagoo Marjon (play-by-play: 2011\u2013present)\nEric Menk (game analyst: 2017\u2013present)\nL.A.

            "content": "Anthony Buller (1613\u20131679) was an English soldier and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1659 and 1660. He fought in the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War.\nBuller was the son of Sir Richard Buller, of Shillingham, Cornwall and his wife Alice Hayward, daughter of Sir Rowland Hayward. He was baptised on 14 November 1613. The Buller family was originally from Somerset and acquired Shillingham in around 1555. In the Civil War, he was a captain on the horse in the Parliamentary army becoming major in 1646. His own reputation for valour was high, but his troopers were given to disorderly and licentious behaviour. He was governor of the Scilly Isles after they were surrendered by Francis Godolphin in 1647 until 1648 when he was captured in the Royalist revolt. He was held prisoner but treated with special kindness as a \"gallant soldier\". He served in an expedition to the West Indies and was a colonel of foot from 1654 to 1655.\nIn 1659, Buller was elected Member of Parliament for Callington in the Third Protectorate Parliament. In 1660, he was elected MP for Saltash in the Convention Parliament. He was a captain in the Duke of York's Horse Guards from 1660 to 1661. In 1661 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament for Bossiney. He was deputy governor of the Scilly Isles from 1666 to 1667. He served in the admiralty regiment from 1667 until his death. He raised 300 men for the defence of the Scilly Isles during the Second Dutch War, and was given a newly built Sloop HMS Portsmouth.\nBuller died before August 1679 when his will was proved. He was married and had a son who inherited his estates in Westminster and Weybridge and four daughters. His brothers Francis Buller and George Buller were also MPs for Saltash.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Dance in Quebec includes dances that are specific to the province of Quebec, Canada, it comprises traditional group, couple, and solo dance as well as contemporary jazz, ballet, and modern dance. There are a number of dance companies and dance schools.\n\n\n== Traditional ==\nIn late 17th century, English country dances, contredances, cotillions, and minuets were popular. The most known dance was the bastringue. In the 18th century, reels and jigs were introduced to Quebec from the British Isles and British colonies in America.\nQuadrilles and the waltz started appearing in the 19th century, along with step-dancing (called la gigue in Quebec) and polka.And they also create a funny move called jigly jigle.\nThe tradition included galops.\nDancing had traditionally been monitored by the Catholic clergy of the province of Quebec, which often used its social and moral influence to ban dancing altogether in many villages and towns.\n\n\n== Classical ballet ==\nThe very first classical ballet studios in the Province of Quebec started appearing in 1945. In 1952, in Montreal, Ludmilla Chiriaeff established the Ballets Chiriaeff, which became Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1957. She then founded, in 1966, the Acad\u00e9mie des Grands Ballets canadiens (nowadays known as the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de ballet contemporain de Montr\u00e9al ).\nMore recently, in 1989, Christiane B\u00e9langer founded the Christiane B\u00e9langer-Danse dance school in Quebec City. She also established the Compagnie Christiane B\u00e9langer (2001), which would become the Ballet de Qu\u00e9bec in 2005, the school thus being renamed \u00c9cole du Ballet de Qu\u00e9bec in 2013, when she also started a college program in classical ballet at C\u00e9gep Garneau. Le Centre Uriel was also the first showcase specialized in classical ballet in Quebec City. The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de ballet du Qu\u00e9bec (2012) is dedicated to the promotion and development of internationally recognized professional classical ballet in Quebec City. Christiane B\u00e9langer co-founded, along with Jacques Marsa from the Op\u00e9ra de Paris, the Concours International PETIPA (May 2015), which was the first francophone international ballet competition held in America. She dissociated herself from its co-founder in November 2012 and created the Comp\u00e9tition internationale de ballet du Canada \u2013 volet Qu\u00e9bec. She also created the \u00c9cole de m\u00e9canique corporelle du Qu\u00e9bec to help elite athletes improve their performances.\n\n\n== Contemporary ==\nDance keeps evolving nowadays in the Province of Quebec. Its most renown organizations are Les Ballets Jazz de Montr\u00e9al, Les Grands Ballets canadiens de Montr\u00e9al as well as the contemporary dance crew La La La Human Steps, directed by the choreographer \u00c9douard Lock and his emblematic dancer Louise Lecavalier. Marie Chouinard, Beno\u00eet Lachambre, Ginette Laurin and the company she created, O Vertigo, D and PPS Danse are also celebrated names whose productions have spread internationally. Christiane B\u00e9langer founded the first dance company in Quebec City after the DansePartout company, founded by Chantal Bellhumeur and subsequently taken over by Luc Tremblay. The Compagnie Christiane B\u00e9langer was established in 2001 and turned a corner to become exclusively dedicated to classical ballet in 2005 ; it is now known as the Ballet de Qu\u00e9bec. Christiane B\u00e9langer was awarded the Prix Fran\u00e7ois-Samson pour le D\u00e9veloppement culturel in 2007 by the Conseil de la culture des r\u00e9gions de Qu\u00e9bec-Chaudi\u00e8res Appalaches. Her style, which was referred to as neoclassical, was an extreme form of dance composed of a combination of martial arts, theatre and bold classical ballet techniques from her classical ballet experience. There are many auditoriums promoting contemporary dance in the Province of Quebec. In Montr\u00e9al, there are Agora de la danse, Danse-Cit\u00e9, Tangente, the Maisons de la culture, Montr\u00e9al art interculturel, Studio 303, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lachapelle, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre G\u00e9su, Usine C, the Pierre-Mercure hall, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Maisonneuve and many others, while Quebec City hosts La Rotonde and the M\u00e9duse facility.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCulture of Quebec\nCulture of Canada\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nS\u00e9vigny, Jean-Pierre.

The institution's primary area of focus is the Arab World, in particular the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It advises regional, and international corporations operating in the region, in addition to policy work with national governments, sovereign entities, and international non-governmental organisations.\niQ is affiliated with the Washington, D.C.-based global law firm Covington & Burling LLP, with both firms providing legal and consulting services jointly to clients in the Middle East and the wider Arab World.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe institution was established by Malik R. Dahlan in 2006 with the stated goal of providing an integrated and comprehensive transnational consulting capacity by coupling the provision of legal advice and services with policy expertise. Dahlan himself is a multi-jurisdictional qualified attorney, with qualifications from Jordan, and the United States of America. He also undertook a Doctorate in Public Policy in Egypt. After working in both the corporate and policy sectors in the Gulf, and the U.S.A., including the Brookings Institution, Dahlan founded iQ in Doha, Qatar.\nThe institution expanded rapidly, opening further offices in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and London, United Kingdom, and establishing an International Advisory Board of renowned figures from law, policy matters, and academia. These include Lord Woolf, formerly Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, and Ahmed Zaki Yamani, formerly Saudi Arabian Minister for Petroleum and Mineral Resources, and a key figure within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). iQ also established a body of International Experts to work on specific legal and policy matters as and when required.\nSubsequent to the establishment of its strategic alliance with Covington & Burling, both firms now occupy the same office premises in London for work on joint representative matters.\n\n\n== Policy work in the Gulf ==\nIn May 2009, iQ organised the inaugural Qatar Law Forum of Global Leaders in Law in Doha, in concert with the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lord Woolf, and Sir William Blair, a prominent High Court Judge in England and Wales, and expert on Islamic finance, served as the Law Forum's Co-Conveners.\niQ was also involved in the creation of the Civil and Commercial Court, and Regulatory Tribunal of the Qatar Financial Centre, twin judicial bodies which represent the first institutional synthesis of shari'ah, common law, and civil law.\nPlans for establishing further offices in Saudi Arabia were announced by iQ in February 2011.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCovington & Burling\nMalik R.

Other views place her death at the time of Trajan Decius (AD 249-51). There is debate whether Saint Eulalia of Barcelona, whose story is similar, is the same person.\n\n\n== Hagiography ==\nEulalia was a devout Christian virgin, aged 12\u201314, whose mother sequestered her in the countryside in AD 304 because all citizens were required to avow faith in the Roman gods. Eulalia ran away to the law court of the governor Dacian at Emerita, professed herself a Christian, insulted the pagan gods and emperor Maximian, and challenged the authorities to martyr her. The judge's attempts at flattery and bribery failed. According to the Spanish-Roman poet Prudentius of the fifth century, who devoted book 3 of his Peristephanon (\"About martyrs\") to Eulalia, she said:\nIsis Apollo Venus nihil est,\nMaximianus et ipse nihil:\nilla nihil, quia facta manu;\nhic, manuum quia facta colit\n(Isis, Apollo and Venus are naught,\nNor is Maximian anything more;\nNothing are they, for by hand they were wrought,\nHe, for of hands he the work doth adore)\nShe was then stripped by the soldiers, tortured with hooks and torches, and burnt at the stake, suffocating from smoke inhalation. She taunted her torturers all the while, and as she expired a dove flew out of her mouth. This frightened away the soldiers and allowed a miraculous snow to cover her nakedness, its whiteness indicating her sainthood. For this reason she is regarded among Catholic school children and teachers alike as the patron saint of snow (inclement weather) days, according to Ian Gibbons, SJ.\nA shrine over her tomb was soon erected. Veneration of Eulalia was already popular with Christians by AD 350; Prudentius' poem increased her fame and relics from her were distributed through Iberia. Bishop Fidelis of M\u00e9rida rebuilt a basilica in her honor around AD 560. Her shrine was the most popular in Visigothic Spain. In c. 780 her body was transferred to Oviedo by King Silo. It lies in a coffin of Arab silver donated by Alfonso VI in 1075. In 1639, she was made patron saint of Oviedo. She appears in Thieleman J. van Braght, Martyrs Mirror: An account of Those who Suffered in the Fourth Century (1660).\n\n\n== Julia of M\u00e9rida ==\nOften linked with Eulalia is Saint Julia of M\u00e9rida, as in the double dedication to Saints Eulalia and Julia. Julia is also said to have been a young girl martyred at M\u00e9rida in 304, in the same persecution by Diocletian, and her feast day is also celebrated on 10 December.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSequence of Saint Eulalia \u2013 French hagiography from AD 880\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBlackburn and Holford-Strevens: Oxford Book of Days, entry for 10 December\n\n\n== External links ==\nEULALIA of Merida from catholicforum\nButler's Lives of the Saints - Saint Eulalia of M\u00e9rida from catholicforum\nSaint Eulalia at the Christian Iconography web site",

            "content": "Ptolemy the Gnostic, or Ptolemaeus Gnosticus, was a disciple of the Gnostic teacher Valentinius and is known for an epistle he wrote to a wealthy woman named Flora, herself not a gnostic.\nPtolemy was probably still alive c. 180. No other certain details are known about his life; Harnack's suggestion that he was identical with the Ptolemy spoken of by St. Justin is as yet unproved. It is not known when Ptolemy became a disciple of Valentinius, but Valentinius was active in the Egyptian city of Alexandria and in Rome. Ptolemy was, with Heracleon, the principal writer of the Italian or Western school of Valentinian Gnosticism, which was active in Rome, Italy, and Southern Gaul.\n\nPtolemy's works have reached us in an incomplete form as follows:\n\na fragment of an exegetical writing preserved by Iren\u00e6us; and\nan epistle to Flora, a Christian lady not otherwise known to us.\n\nThe latter is found in the works of Epiphanius. It was written in response to Flora's inquiry concerning the origin of the Law of the Old Testament. The Decalogue, Ptolemy states, cannot be attributed to the Supreme God, nor to the devil; indeed, the set of laws does not even proceed from a single law-giver. A part of it is the work of an inferior god, analogous to the gnostic demiurge; the second part is attributable to Moses, and the third part to the elders of the Jewish people. In addition, Ptolemy subdivides the part of the Decalogue ascribed to the inferior god into three further sections:\nthe absolutely pure legislation of the Decalogue which was not destroyed but fulfilled by the Saviour;\nthe laws mixed with evil, including the right of retaliation, which were abolished by the Saviour because they were incompatible with His nature;\nthe section which is typical and symbolical of the higher world.\nThis part of the Decalogue includes such precepts as circumcision and fasting and was raised by the saviour from a sensible to a spiritual plane. The god who is the author of the law, insofar as it is not the product of human effort, is the demiurge who occupies a middle position between the Supreme God and the devil. He is the creator of the material universe, is neither perfect nor the author of evil, but ought to be called 'just' and benevolent to the extent of his abilities.\nIn his cosmogonic depiction of the universe, Ptolemy referred to an extensive system of aeons that emanated from a monadic spiritual source. Thirty of these, he believed, ruled the higher world, the pleroma. This system became the basis of an exegesis which expounds the first Ogdoad of the Pleroma based on the prologue of John's gospel.\n\n\n== References ==\nElaine Pagels.

            "content": "In legal disputes regarding product liability, a consumer expectations test is used to determine whether the product is negligently manufactured or whether a warning on the product is defective. Under this test, the product is considered defective if a reasonable consumer would find it defective. As an example, a reasonable consumer might find exposed blades on a lawnmower, without plastic guards that could be installed for pennies, to be defective because the risk of not having the plastic guards is higher than the costs of installing those guards.\nThe test is mostly applied to non-complex products about which consumers might have expectations. For example, the consumer might not have specific safety expectations about the design of landing gear on an airplane except for the fact that they do not expect to crash while taking the plane.\nA closely related test is risk-utility test. Traditionally, the risk-utility test was used for design defects, while the consumer expectation test was applied to manufacturing defects. However, some jurisdictions apply the consumer expectation test to design defects as well. See Calles v. Scripto-Tokai Corp., 2007 WL 495315 (Ill. Feb. 16, 2007).\nOfficial definition of consumer expectation test: An unreasonably dangerous product is one that is dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community of its characteristics.\nThis test is commonly applied in product liability cases in the United States.\nIn the European Union, the European Council Directive on General Product Safety 2001/95/EC states (at Article 3(f)) that the conformance of a product to a general safety requirement shall be assessed taking into account \"reasonable customer expectations regarding safety\" (amongst other considerations).

            "content": "Lethbridge Airpark (ICAO: YLED) is a privately owned aerodrome located 6 km (3.7 mi) north of the rural township of Lethbridge between the regional cities of Geelong 35 km (22 mi) to the south and Ballarat 50 km (31 mi) to the north in Victoria, Australia. The 80 ha (198 acres) site caters to private and recreational pilots, and offers flight training. Current facilities at the airport include several hangars, an aircraft maintenance workshop, and basic amenities including toilets and showers.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Airpark was established in 1992 as a private venture with the support of the Golden Plains Shire on a site that was carefully selected to take advantage of unrestricted airspace, existing transportation links and distance from urban development. The first tenant was the Geelong Sports Aviators Club, relocating to Lethbridge in the same year, following the sale and closure of the airfield at Lovely Banks. An aircraft maintenance provider has operated at the airfield since 1993.\nFrom 1996, safety improvements including an observation tower to assist with flight training and fire fighting services including a water reserve and increased pumping capacity were progressively added. By 2002, traffic had grown to a level to warrant the establishment of a discrete Common traffic advisory frequency to allow pilots to co-ordinate movements on and around the airfield. In 2006 Alpine Aircraft Sales, the Australian distributor for Alpi Aviation and Just Aircraft relocated operations to a purpose-built hangar at Lethbridge Airpark. By 2008, there were 50 aircraft based at Lethbridge.\n\n\n== Expansion ==\nIn July 2013, the Victorian Government announced a grant of $1 million to help fund upgrades to the facilities at Lethbridge Airpark. The funds will be used to create a 1,200 m (3,900 ft) \u00d7 18 m (59 ft) sealed surface on runway 11/29. The upgrades which also include the installation of a Pilot Activated Lighting system, construction of over 100 hangar sites, a sealed helipad and parking areas will allow larger aircraft such as the Beechcraft B200 King Air used by Air Ambulance Victoria all weather access to the field. A water delivery system for fire fighting aircraft operating for the Country Fire Authority who regularly use the airfield as a staging location is also planned as part of the upgrade, with the remaining costs to be paid by the operator.\nThe planned upgrades are expected to create more than 100 ongoing jobs, and position the airport as an important year round hub for emergency services aircraft. It is also hoped that aviation related businesses such as aircraft assembly, sales and service will be encouraged to establish themselves at Lethbridge.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of airports in Victoria\nTransportation in Australia\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Strongbow is a dry cider produced by H. P. Bulmer in England since 1962. Strongbow is the world's leading cider with a 15 per cent volume share of the global cider market and a 29 per cent volume share of the UK cider market. Bulmer's is a subsidiary of Heineken International, the multinational Dutch brewer.\nIn 2011, Strongbow Gold, produced in Belgium, was launched across Europe in response to cider's growing popularity on the continent. In 2012, Strongbow was the highest selling cider in Australia, and was the second highest selling cider in North America.\nThe majority of Strongbow is produced at Bulmer's Hereford plant, although regional variations are also produced at Heineken's cider mill in Belgium, and in Australia, where SABMiller own the rights to the brand.\nIn 2014, the original Strongbow dry cider was discontinued in the USA by Heineken and replaced with two new sweeter variants.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nStrongbow was launched in England by H.P. Bulmer in 1962. It is named after the Cambro-Norman knight Richard de Clare, later Earl of Pembroke, whose nickname \"Strongbow\" was believed to be due to his heavy reliance on Welsh archers during campaigns in Ireland, but it more likely a mistranslation or mistranscription of Striguil, one of his holdings. It was initially marketed as \"the strong cider for men\". By 1970, it was the second highest selling cider in the world after its Bulmer's stablemate Woodpecker. By 2001, Strongbow was among the top ten drinks by sales in English and Welsh pubs and bars. In 2003 Bulmers was purchased by Scottish & Newcastle, who in turn were taken over by Heineken in 2008. In January 2011, Heineken announced their intention to take the Strongbow brand global.\n\n\n== Production methods ==\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Strongbow is a blend of bitter-sweet cider and culinary apples, with 50 different varieties of apple used. The apples are grown in England and France. It is mass-produced using modern methods, and contains apple concentrate and sugar. It is fermented with a controlled yeast strain, and at least some varieties are flavoured with artificial sweeteners. The Bulmers Strongbow vat is the largest alcoholic container in the world, with a capacity of 1.5 million gallons (6.8 million litres).\n\n\n== Variations ==\nIn the UK, Strongbow is available on draught at 4.5% ABV and in cans and bottles at 5% ABV. In 2012 the UK packaged versions were reduced from 5.3% ABV to 5.0% ABV.\nStrongbow Gold is the variant available in mainland Europe and is available only in bottles. It was launched in May 2011, and its major markets include Italy and Hungary. It is 5% ABV and designed to be served over ice. It is over 50% apple juice, making it a similar product to Magners and Stella Cidre. It also contains glucose syrup, glucose-fructose syrup, food acidifier: malic acid, anti-oxidant: sulphur dioxide, colouring agent: cochineal, burned sugar. It is made in Belgium at Heineken's Stassen plant.\nStrongbow is exported to numerous overseas markets. Sleeman Breweries took over the distribution rights for Canada in 2001, and is the fifth highest selling cider in the United States, where it was imported by Vermont Hard Cider until August 2012, when Heineken regained the rights. It was launched into the Australian market in 1970, and today still remains as Australia\u2019s most popular cider. Strongbow is available in five varieties in Australia: Dry, Sweet, Original (formerly sold as \"Draught\"), Clear (a low carbohydrate variety) and Pear. Foster's Group purchased the Strongbow brand in Australia in 2003, and continues to produce, distribute & market the brand. They were themselves purchased by SABMiller in 2011.\nIn 2012, Heineken launched \"Strongbow Pear\" in the UK and in 2013 introduced \"Strongbow Dark Fruit\" which contains blackcurrant and blackberry juices. In 2014, \"Strongbow Citrus Edge\" was introduced, which contains lemon and lime. 2015 saw the introduction of \"Cloudy Apple\", a scrumpy version of the cider.\nIn 2014 in the USA, Heineken launched two new sweeter flavours, dubbed \"Gold Apple\" and \"Honey & Apple\". Strongbow subsequently discontinued the original dry cider Strongbow flavor in the USA. The move to discontinue the original dry cider recipe in the USA and replace it with two sweeter varieties is being criticized by some vocal customers, with comments related to the discontinuation appearing on various internet forums, the Strongbow Facebook page, and the USA Heineken Strongbow web page.\nIn 2015 in the USA, a variety pack was released, which includes the two existing flavors \"Gold Apple\" and \"Honey & Apple\" along with two additional flavors \"Red Berries\" and \"Ginger.\"  \"Cherry Blossom\" was introduced in 2016.\n\n\n== Discontinued brand extensions ==\n\nPreviously Strongbow White was available in Australia, which had a much higher alcohol content (8.5%). It ceased production sometime after 2000.\nStrongbow Sirrus (5% ABV), was launched in summer 2005 to compete with C&C's Magners Original Irish Cider. Sirrus was formulated as a 'smooth' cider designed to be poured over ice, and was only available in bottles; it has since been discontinued.\nIn 2007, the company began trials of Strongbow On Ice, a competitor to other ciders that are served over ice. This uses a specially designed pump that creates a \"head\" of ice made from cider on the top of the pint. Trials were unsuccessful however, and the product was discontinued.\nStrongbow Black (previously Strongbow Super) at 7.5% ABV, was delisted by Heineken in 2011 on social responsibility grounds.\n\n\n== Advertising ==\nThe original Norman archer logo was designed by artist Barney Bubbles. The \"thudding arrows\" have been a signature of the brand's television advertising since the 1960s. Towards the end of the advertisement, two arrows thud into a bar counter near a glass of Strongbow, or its bar pump.\nAdvertisements from 1998 to 2002 featured Johnny Vaughan and the \"live to loaf\" line. The campaign focused on Vaughan's character, who was always finding new ways to get the most out of life with the minimum effort. Vaughan was credited by Bulmers with giving credibility to the Strongbow brand among the key 18 to 24-year-old group. Between 1998 and 2000 Strongbow sales rose by 30 per cent.\nIn 2010 TV adverts in the UK were based on the \"medal ceremony\" scene at the end of the Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope movie: three men walk down an aisle flanked by large numbers of men; step up a raised podium at the far end; and receive a reward \u2013 a pint of Strongbow \u2013 for their \"heroic deeds\" (i.e.: performing their ordinary jobs). Adverts in 2012 showed fanciful representations of normal situations (goalkeeping, potting a black ball, best man's speech) where those seen in the advert would be next seen drinking Strongbow having \"earnt it\" for accomplishing such situations. The latest advert depicts a duplex-style apple orchard divided between bitter and sweet reflecting Strongbow being \"bittersweet by nature\".\nIn 2015, Strongbow began its \"Cider at its Bestest\" campaign in the US, featuring Patrick Stewart.\n\n\n=== Sponsorship ===\nStrongbow were official shirt sponsors of Edinburgh football club Heart of Midlothian from 1992\u20132002. Strongbow also sponsored Leeds United Football Club from 2000\u20132003. Strongbow reputedly paid \u00a33 million a year for the rights.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCider in the United Kingdom\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUK website\nAustralian website\nUSA website\nStrongbow global website",

            "content": "Cindy Chavez (born April 7, 1964) is an American politician, who serves as a Santa Clara County Supervisor representing close to 400,000 residents in Downtown, East, and South San Jose. She is also the Vice President of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. Her public service career began in the 1990s as a policy analyst for health care, public health, human services and transportation for the Board of Supervisors. She served two terms on the San Jose City Council, where she was also Vice Mayor, and also served on the board leadership of public agencies such as the San Jose Redevelopment Agency, and executive director of Working Partnerships USA and the South Bay AFL-CIO Labor Council. She is a graduate of San Jose State University, is married and has a son in high school.\n\n\n== Career as Santa Clara County Supervisor ==\nAs a supervisor, Chavez chairs the Board\u2019s Children, Families and Seniors Committee and serves on the Finance and Government Operations Committee. She also serves as Vice-Chair of the $400 million Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) and is a member of the CalTrain Board of Directors and will play a leadership role in the electrification of CalTrain and high speed rail. She is also a Director of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Chavez has lead efforts to create jail diversion programs for mentally ill offenders and the homeless including sobering stations, crisis stabilization beds and mobile crisis teams. She was the architect of Santa Clara County's successful $950-million dollar housing bond in the November 2016 election that will be instrumental in getting housing built for the mentally ill and homeless. Similarly, Chavez worked to develop a shelter for homeless LGBTQ youth, a large percentage whom were kicked out of their homes. In 2017, Chavez joined the County in filing a lawsuit against the Trump Administration - Trump vs Santa Clara County - when the administration threatened to withhold federal funds affecting hospitals, social services and thousands of children, Seniors and the disabled. The Trump Administration targeted Santa Clara County for its \"sanctuary city\" status. A federal judge ruled in Santa Clara County\u2019s favor. Under Chavez's leadership, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors approved bail reforms for low-level and non-violent offenders making Santa Clara County the first in the state of California to take action. The reforms are designed to reduce the number of people in jail and prompted the California legislature to take action. Chavez worked to streamline and improve Santa Clara County\u2019s foster care system to include schools and improve the dually-involved youth system merging child welfare with juvenile justice. Under Chavez's leadership, Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors approved $6 million to built a new resource center for foster youth (The Hub) to provide resources so they complete their education, apply to and get into college and get jobs and basic services. She also is taking action against human trafficking with the Santa Clara County Human Trafficking Commission she founded and co-chairs with the Santa Clara County Sheriff and District Attorney.\n\n\n== Tenure on the City Council ==\nChavez was first elected to the council in 1998 and re-elected in 2002. In 2005, she was chosen by San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales and confirmed by the council to serve as Vice Mayor. As a former Downtown District Three Council Representative, Chavez chaired the Rules Committee and served on the Downtown Parking Board, Guadalupe River Park Task Force, Police and Fire Retirement Board, San Jose Beautiful and the SJ/SC Treatment Plant Advisory Committee. Additionally, she served on local and regional bodies, including the Valley Transportation Authority as vice-chair, VTA Policy Advisory Board and Nanotechnology Infrastructure and Assets Subcommittee. Prior to her election to the City Council, Chavez had served as the staff director of labor-aligned Working Partnerships USA and as the Director of Education and Outreach for the South Bay AFL-CIO Labor Council. She also served for three years as budget and policy aide to then Supervisor Ron Gonzales.\n\n\n== Campaign for Mayor ==\nIn 2006 Chavez ran for mayor in a field of ten candidates hoping to succeed termed-out Ron Gonzales. In the mayoral primary held on June 6, 2006, in a crowded field of ten candidates, Chavez qualified for the two-person primary against Chuck Reed.\nDuring the early stages of the campaign Chavez out-raised her opponents and was the frontrunner in some polls. Chavez also secured many high-profile endorsements, including the Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith, the Silicon Valley Young Democrats, Congressman Mike Honda and former San Jose mayor Susan Hammer, former US Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta and former US President Bill Clinton. However, after she came in second place in the primary voting held on June 6, 2006; Ms. Chavez was never able to regain her early lead and her opponent, Chuck Reed, was leading in all the major polls going into the run-off election.\n\n\n== Career After San Jose City Council ==\nChavez became the Executive Officer of the South Bay AFL-CIO Labor Council in March 2009. The South Bay AFL-CIO Labor Council represents ninety unions and over 100,000 union members in Santa Clara and San Benito counties. The Labor Council's stated objective is to advance candidates, causes, and policies that benefit working families. It achieves this objective with a combination of activities, including community organizing, leadership training, campaigning, and issues advocacy. The Labor Council is proud to run the largest, most sophisticated, grassroots political campaign operation in the South San Francisco Bay area.\nChavez was also Executive Director of Working Partnerships USA, a labor-aligned advocacy group. Among its signature accomplishments are pioneering the Children\u2019s Health Initiative, making Santa Clara County the first in the nation to provide health coverage to every child and securing passage of the San Jose Living Wage ordinance.\nShe worked as an instructor of local civics at her alma mater San Jos\u00e9 State University. When the Santa Clara County District Attorney\u2019s office began an investigation into Supervisor George Shirakawa Jr.\u2019s misuse of county funds, Chavez resigned her position with the South Bay Labor Council. After Shirakawa resigned and pleaded guilty to five felonies and seven misdemeanors, Chavez announced that she would run for the District 2 seat.\nIn early 2013, Chavez was elected as the Vice-Chair of the Santa Clara County Democratic Central Committee.\nOn June 4, 2013 she qualified for the runoff and faced Teresa Alvarado in the July 2013 special election.\nOn August 20, 2013 she was sworn-in as Santa Clara County's District 2 Supervisor.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCindy Chavez and Sunshine Ordinance\nCindy Chavez Tackles New Role As SJSU Instructor\nSan Jos\u00e9 State University Press Release.\nFormer San Jose City Council member Cindy Chavez graduated from San Jose State University in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in political science.",

The film co-stars Kerry Washington, John Witherspoon, Tracy Morgan and Lochlyn Munro.\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on July 14, 2006 to commercial success but largely negative reviews, including three Golden Raspberry Awards.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film starts off with Calvin \"Babyface\" Simms (Marlon Wayans) who is a very short convict. He is seen getting released and planning a robbery to steal a diamond with the help of his goofball cohort Percy (Tracy Morgan). After the successful robbery, the duo are almost arrested, but not before Calvin manages to stash the diamond in a nearby woman's purse. The thieves follow the handbag's owner to her home where they discover a couple, Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa Edwards (Kerry Washington), who are eager to have a child.\nCalvin and Percy hatch a plot to pass Calvin off as a baby left on the couple's doorstep. After seeing Calvin, Darryl and Vanessa, wanting a child, immediately adopt the baby as their own. However, Vanessa's dad Francis \"Pops\" (John Witherspoon) has a bad feeling about Calvin. Friends of the couple find Calvin odd as well. Soon, Calvin warms up to the family. A local goon named Walken (Chazz Palminteri), discovers the deception and demands the diamond from Percy. Percy arrives at the house that Calvin is staying in, and convinces Walken's henchmen that Darryl is his partner. Walken and his henchmen go to the house and they keep Calvin and Darryl hostage. In a series of comedic maneuvers, Calvin manages to rescue Darryl and have Walken arrested. Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police.\nBefore he leaves, Calvin thanks Darryl for taking care of him even though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl would make a great father for a real child someday. Calvin is about to be out of Darryl's life for good, as Darryl watches him leave. Calvin is crying hysterically, so Darryl decides to let Calvin stay and from that point on, the two men become the best of friends. The film ends at some point in the future with Calvin and Pops playing with Darryl and Vanessa's real baby, who looks exactly like Darryl (Shawn Wayans's face superimposed on that of the baby). And they all lived happily ever after.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMarlon Wayans as Calvin Simms\nShawn Wayans as Darryl Edwards\nKerry Washington as Vanessa Edwards\nJohn Witherspoon as Pops\nBrittany Daniel as Brittany\nTracy Morgan as Percy\nLochlyn Munro as Greg\nChazz Palminteri as Walken\nMolly Shannon as Soccer Mom\nDavid Alan Grier as Jimmy\nDave Sheridan as Rosco\nJohn DeSantis as Bruno (credited as John De Santis)\nFred Stoller as Richard\nAlex Borstein as Janet\nKelly Coffield Park as The Jeweler\nDamien Dante Wayans as Officer Wilson\nUriel Garcia as Shaq\nRob Schneider as D-Rex (uncredited cameo)\nVerne Troyer as Calvin's body double (uncredited)\n\n\n== Production ==\nFilming began in the Vancouver area on September 17, 2005 and finished on January 21, 2006.\nThe scenes with Calvin Sims were played twice: once by nine-year-old 75 cm (2 ft 6 in) tall dwarf actor Linden Porco together with the other actors, and once by Marlon Wayans alone, using a \"bluescreen\" technique with a green background and green clothes.

            "content": "Lorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor is a novel by English author Richard Doddridge Blackmore, published in 1869. It is a romance based on a group of historical characters and set in the late 17th century in Devon and Somerset, particularly around the East Lyn Valley area of Exmoor. In 2003, the novel was listed on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nBlackmore experienced difficulty in finding a publisher, and the novel was first published anonymously in 1869, in a limited three-volume edition of just 500 copies, of which only 300 sold. The following year it was republished in an inexpensive one-volume edition and became a huge critical and financial success. It has never been out of print.\nIt received acclaim from Blackmore's contemporary, Margaret Oliphant, and as well from later Victorian writers including Robert Louis Stevenson, Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Thomas Hardy. A favourite among females, it is also popular among male readers, and was chosen by male students at Yale in 1906 as their favourite novel.\nBy his own account, Blackmore relied on a \"phonologic\" style for his characters' speech, emphasising their accents and word formation. He expended great effort, in all of his novels, on his characters' dialogues and dialects, striving to recount realistically not only the ways, but also the tones and accents, in which thoughts and utterances were formed by the various sorts of people who lived in the Exmoor district in the 17th century.\nBlackmore incorporated real events and places into the novel. The Great Winter described in chapters 41\u201345 was a real event. He himself attended Blundell's School in Tiverton which serves as the setting for the opening chapters. One of the inspirations behind the plot is said to be the shooting of a young woman at a church in Chagford, Devon, in the 17th century. Unlike the heroine of the novel, she did not survive, but is commemorated in the church. Apparently, Blackmore invented the name \"Lorna\", possibly drawing on a Scottish source.\nAccording to the preface, the work is a romance and not a historical novel, because the author neither \"dares, nor desires, to claim for it the dignity or cumber it with the difficulty of an historical novel.\" As such, it combines elements of traditional romance, of Sir Walter Scott's historical novel tradition, of the pastoral tradition, of traditional Victorian values, and of the contemporary sensation novel trend. The basis for Blackmore's historical understanding is Macaulay's History of England and its analysis of the Monmouth rebellion. Along with the historical aspects are folk traditions, such as the many legends based around both the Doones and Tom Faggus. The composer Puccini once considered using the story as the plot for an opera, but abandoned the idea.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\nThe book is set in the 17th century in the Badgworthy Water region of Exmoor in Devon and Somerset, England. John (in West Country dialect, pronounced \"Jan\") Ridd is the son of a respectable farmer who was murdered in cold blood by one of the notorious Doone clan, a once noble family, now outlaws, in the isolated Doone Valley. Battling his desire for revenge, John also grows into a respectable farmer and takes good care of his mother and two sisters. He falls hopelessly in love with Lorna, a girl he meets by accident, who turns out to be not only (apparently) the granddaughter of Sir Ensor Doone (lord of the Doones), but destined to marry (against her will) the impetuous, menacing, and now jealous heir of the Doone Valley, Carver Doone. Carver will let nothing get in the way of his marriage to Lorna, which he plans to force upon her once Sir Ensor dies and he comes into his inheritance.\n\nSir Ensor dies, and Carver becomes lord of the Doones. John Ridd helps Lorna escape to his family's farm, Plover's Barrows. Since Lorna is a member of the hated Doone clan, feelings are mixed toward her in the Ridd household, but she is nonetheless defended against the enraged Carver's retaliatory attack on the farm. A member of the Ridd household notices Lorna's necklace, a jewel that she was told by Sir Ensor belonged to her mother. During a visit from the Counsellor, Carver's father and the wisest of the Doone family, the necklace is stolen from Plover's Barrows. Shortly after its disappearance, a family friend discovers Lorna's origins, learning that the necklace belonged to a Lady Dugal, who was robbed and murdered by a band of outlaws. Only her daughter survived the attack. It becomes apparent that Lorna, being evidently the long-lost girl in question, is in fact heiress to one of the largest fortunes in the country, and not a Doone after all (although the Doones are remotely related, being descended from a collateral branch of the Dugal family). She is required by law, but against her will, to return to London to become a ward in Chancery. Despite John and Lorna's love for one another, their marriage is out of the question.\nKing Charles II dies, and the Duke of Monmouth (the late king's illegitimate son) challenges Charles's brother James for the throne. The Doones, abandoning their plan to marry Lorna to Carver and claim her wealth, side with Monmouth in the hope of reclaiming their ancestral lands. However, Monmouth is defeated at the Battle of Sedgemoor, and his associates are sought for treason. John Ridd is captured during the revolution. Innocent of all charges, he is taken to London by an old friend to clear his name. There, he is reunited with Lorna (now Lorna Dugal), whose love for him has not diminished. When he thwarts an attack on Lorna's great-uncle and legal guardian Earl Brandir, John is granted a pardon, a title, and a coat of arms by the king and returns a free man to Exmoor.\nIn the meantime, the surrounding communities have grown tired of the Doones and their depredations. Knowing the Doones better than any other man, John leads the attack on their land. All the Doone men are killed, except the Counsellor (from whom John retrieves the stolen necklace) and his son Carver, who escapes, vowing revenge. When Earl Brandir dies and Judge Jeffreys, as Lord Chancellor, becomes Lorna's guardian, she is granted her freedom to return to Exmoor and marry John. During their wedding, Carver bursts into the Church of St Mary, Oare. He shoots Lorna and flees. Distraught and filled with blinding rage, John pursues and confronts him. A struggle ensues in which Carver is left sinking in a mire. Exhausted and bloodied from the fight, John can only pant as he watches Carver slip away. He returns to discover that Lorna is not dead, and after a period of anxious uncertainty, she survives to live happily ever after.\n\n\n== Chronological key ==\nThe narrator, John Ridd, says he was born on 29 November 1661; in Chapter 24, he mentions Queen Anne as the current monarch, so the time of narration is 1702\u20131714 making him 40\u201352 years old. Although he celebrates New Year's Day on 1 January, at that time in England the year in terms of A.D. \"begins\" Annunciation Style on 25 March, so 14 February 1676 would still be 1675 according to the old reckoning. Most of the dates below are given explicitly in the book.\n\n\n== Other versions and cultural references ==\nThe novel has inspired at least ten movies and broadcast mini-series; see Category:Films based on Lorna Doone\nLorna Doone is also a shortbread cookie made by Nabisco.\nTitle character Lorna Doone, a B-movie actress in a Thomas Tryon novella was christened in honor of Blackmore's character.\nLorna Doone was said to be the favourite book of Australian bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly, who may have thought of the idea of his armour by reading of the outlaw Doones \"with iron plates on breast and head.\"\nThe phrase \"Lorna Doone\" is used in Cockney rhyming slang for spoon.\nLorna Doone is a character portrayed by Christine McIntyre in The Three Stooges shorts The Hot Scots and Scotched in Scotland. She schemed with Angus and MacPherson to steal the treasures of the Earl of Glenheather Castle, trick the Stooges and frighten them away. The constables later arrested her.\nThe book inspired the song \"Pangs of Lorna\" by Kraus.\nThere is reference to R.D. Blackmore's Lorna Doone in John Galsworthy's play Justice (1910)\nThe musical \"Loving Lorna Doone\", with book and lyrics by Aaron Rocklyn and Music by Jaymi Wilson and Anthony Knutson, is based on the book\nThe name Lorna Doone is mentioned in Carole Bayer Sager's 1977 international hit, \"You're Moving Out Today\".\nThe character of Lorna from the animated mini-series Over the Garden Wall (miniseries) was inspired by Lorna Doone\nLorna Doone II was the name of a yawl type of sailboat on episode 7 (Risk to Death) of Baywatch Hawaii.\nBritish Professional wrestler Jack Baltus was billed as Carver Doone.\nIn the Dudley Do-Right cartoon, \"Elevenworth Prison\", Snidely Whiplash refers to Dudley Do Right as \"Lorna Doone\" and Do Right calls himself \"Lorna Doone\" also.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBlackmore, R.

            "content": "Yumiko Shiina (\u690e\u540d \u88d5\u7f8e\u5b50, Shiina Yumiko, born November 25, 1978), known by her stage name Ringo Sheena (\u690e\u540d \u6797\u6a8e, Shiina Ringo), is a Japanese singer, songwriter and musician. She was also the founder and lead vocalist of the band Tokyo Jihen, when it was active.\nShe describes herself as \"Shinjuku-kei Jisaku-Jien-ya (\u65b0\u5bbf\u7cfb\u81ea\u4f5c\u81ea\u6f14\u5c4b, a Shinjuku-style writer-performer)\". She was ranked number 36 in a list of Japan's top 100 musicians compiled by HMV in 2003.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSheena was born with an esophageal atresia in which the esophagus narrows as it approaches the stomach. Treatment of this involved several operations, at least one of which required her right shoulder blade to be cut open. These surgeries left Sheena with large scars on her shoulder blades, said to give the impression that an angel's wings had been removed.\n\n\n=== Initial solo career ===\nSheena released her first official single \"K\u014dfukuron\" in May 1998, when she was 19 years old. She subsequently made singles \"Kabukich\u014d no Jo\u014d\" and \"Koko de Kiss Shite\", the latter becoming her first hit.\nThis was followed by the release of her first album, Muzai Moratorium, in February 1999. The album was a major hit. \"Gips\" was due to be the next single, but when Sheena had to cancel recording due to illness, \"Honn\u014d\" was released as the fourth single instead. Shina chose a hospital as the setting for the music video for \"Honn\u014d\".\nThe fifth and sixth singles, \"Gips\" and \"Tsumi to Batsu\", were released at the same time to prevent overlap with the release of her second album, Sh\u014dso Strip, in March 2000.\nSheena had initially indicated that she would retire as \"Sheena Ringo\" when she had released three albums. At the time the second album was released, she was among the top three Japanese female artists, along with Hikaru Utada and Ayumi Hamasaki, in terms of popularity and annual income. However, she was uncomfortable with being regarded as an icon, and wanted her career to branch out more from the mainstream. When she began to produce her third album under the tentative title \"Fushigi, Waizatsu, Ekisentorikku (\u4e0d\u601d\u8b70\u30fb\u7325\u96d1\u30fb\u30a8\u30ad\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af, Wonder, Vulgar, Eccentric)\" she intended to make it her last solo album.\nShe released the single \"Mayonaka wa Junketsu\" in March 2001, with the intention of including it on a third album. The music video was created in a retro-anime style that depicted Ringo as a sort of mid-'60s spy movie heroine. In 2002, she released a two-disc multilingual cover album Utaite My\u014dri: Sono Ichi. Since she felt that a cover album did not count as a bona fide album, she began to work on her third original album.\nIn 2003, she released her third album, titled Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana.\nTowards the conclusion of her solo career, she released her final solo single, \"Ringo no Uta\" (\"Apple's Song\"), which was adopted by the national children's song TV program Minna no Uta. This song had a summation of her career, and the music video included references to all of her previous videos.\nIn 2004, Sheena undertook the role of music director for the stage play KKP (Kentaro Kobayashi Produce) #004 Lens, which is based on the story of her short film Tanpen Kinema Hyaku-Iro Megane.\n\n\n=== Tokyo Jihen ===\n\nOn May 31, 2004, Sheena formed a band called Tokyo Jihen (\u6771\u4eac\u4e8b\u5909, T\u014dky\u014d Jihen, \"The Tokyo Incidents\"). The band was first introduced in Sheena's Sugoroku Ecstasy tour and is featured on Sheena's Electric Mole DVD.\nThe original lineup of Tokyo Jihen was Ringo Sheena (vocals, guitar, melodica); Mikio Hirama (\u30d2\u30e9\u30de\u30df\u30ad\u30aa, Hirama Mikio, also known as Mikki) (guitar, backing vocals); Seiji Kameda (\u4e80\u7530\u8aa0\u6cbb, Kameda Seiji) (bass guitar); H Zett M (H\u662f\u90fdM, HZM), also known as Masayuki Hiizumi (\u30d2\u30a4\u30ba\u30df\u30de\u30b5\u30e6\u6a5f, Hiizumi Masayuki, from jazz instrumental band PE'Z), (keyboard/piano); and Toshiki Hata (\u5204\u7530\u7db4\u8272, Hata Toshiki) (drums). All of them were members of the back-up band for Sheena Ringo's solo tour \"Sugoroku Ecstasy\" in 2003.\nHiizumi and Hirama left Tokyo Jihen in July 2005, and the band selected two new members: Ryosuke Nagaoka (\u9577\u5ca1\u4eae\u4ecb, Nagaoka Ryosuke), also known as Ukigumo (\u6d6e\u96f2, Drifting Cloud), on guitar and backing vocals, and Keitaro Izawa (\u4f0a\u6fa4\u5553\u592a\u90ce, Izawa Keitaro), also known as Ichiyou Izawa (\u4f0a\u6fa4\u4e00\u8449, Izawa Ichiyou), on keyboards in September 2005. The band released its second album featuring the new lineup in January 2006 and played two concerts, at the Osaka-Jo Hall in Osaka and the Budokan in Tokyo, in February 2006.\n\n\n=== Resumption of solo work ===\nIn late 2006, Ringo announced that she would resume work as a solo artist as the Music Director for the 2007 film Sakuran. The album Heisei F\u016bzoku (2007) is the soundtrack from this film. Violinist Neko Sait\u014d and the band Soil & \"Pimp\" Sessions appear on the album. A song featuring her and Soil, \"Karisome Otome (Death Jazz version)\" was released on iTunes Japan exclusively on November 11, 2006. It went to the top of the charts and remained there for days.\nIn June 2007, Sheena was asked to compose music for the kabuki Sannin Kichisa by Kanzaburo Nakamura. She composed the ending theme and some other music.\nIn September 2008, Sheena provided Japanese boy's band, Tokio with two songs for their singles.\nIn February 2009, Sheena had written music for Japanese rock duo Puffy AmiYumi. The duo's member Ami was introduced to Sheena by Hikaru Utada. Ami is a fan of Sheena's music, which amounted to their friendship together.\nIn March 2009, Sheena Ringo received the newcomer Fine Arts Award in the Popular Culture category from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. In May of the same year, Sheena released a solo single titled \"Ariamaru Tomi\", which was used as the theme song for the TV drama Smile. In June, Sheena released her solo album titled Sanmon Gossip after a long hiatus. On December 2, 2009, Sheena releases the single \"N\u014dd\u014dteki Sanpunkan\" with Tokyo Jihen after an interval of about two years.\n\n\n== Singing and songwriting style ==\nSheena is an accomplished musician and songwriter who writes music spanning numerous genres. She is well known for her eccentricity, rolling her \"r\"s and creating promotional music videos with striking visuals.\nShe admired Eddi Reader's voice, but felt her own voice was not as clear and sounded hoarse. She admired Janis Ian's singing and wrote \"Seventeen\" in tribute to Ian's \"At Seventeen\". She later covered \"Love Is Blind\". She listens to many genres of music. At the time of her debut, she has ten closely written pages of lists of her favorite musicians. They included various genres such as classical music, Japanese and American popular music from the 1950s and 1960s, contemporary rock, and the local band Fukuoka.\nShe mainly plays rhythm guitar, but she plays other musical instruments. During live shows she sometimes plays the piano and occasionally plays the bass guitar. While recording, she sometimes plays piano and drums, and occasionally uses uncommon musical instruments such as a melodica and a shamisen.\n\n\n== Stage name ==\nAt her audition in 1996, she introduced herself as \"Sheena Ringo\" for the first time. \"Ringo\" means \"apple\" in Japanese. She said that \"Ringo\" originated from her class nickname when she often blushed in public, and from The Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr.\nShe declared recently that she followed the naming of the pen name of her favorite manga artist, Sensha Yoshida. His first name is just a name of an object like Ringo (\"Sensha\" in this case meaning a \"tank\" in English). She thought that those who heard her name would be shocked by that.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Duesenberg Starplayer guitar which Sheena has used recorded the historical sales of about 1000 sets in Japan in 2000.\nSheena's name often appeared on the books, movies, TV dramas and songs, such as the Japanese movie All About Lily Chou-Chou (with The Beatles, Bj\u00f6rk, and UA), Maximum the Hormone's song \"Sheena basu tei de matsu.\", Kreva's single \"Idome\", the Japanese movie Linda Linda Linda, the TV drama Furuhata Ninzabur\u014d final series, the book by Taro Aso who is the 92nd Prime Minister of Japan Totetsumonai Nihon (as a singer representative of Jpop with Hikaru Utada).\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLenny Kravitz stated that he admired Ringo's music video and both her way of making music and the presentation, and said that he wanted to meet her in 2000. When Courtney Love visited Japan in 2001, she was recommended several Japanese female rock singers by the music magazine editor of rockin'on. Sheena and Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her were in Courtney's favor. Courtney tried to contact Sheena or to give the song to Sheena, but she failed. Mika mentioned Ringo as one of his favorite Japanese artists, alongside Puffy AmiYumi, The Yellow Monkey, Yoko Kanno, and the Yoshida Brothers; in several interviews during his visit to Japan in 2007. Jack Barnett of These New Puritans who was visiting Japan for the Summer Sonic 08 said in an interview that he was a great fan of Ringo Sheena and bought all her works while he was there, as they were not available in the United Kingdom.\nHer third album, Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana, was ranked second in CNN International Asia's list of \"the 2000s' most under-appreciated Japanese music of the last decade\" on December 22, 2009. Sheena also got a mention in The Guardian as one of Japan's artists \"deserve to be seen and heard in the west\" in 2010.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSheena's older brother Junpei Shiina is an R&B musician, who debuted in 2000 under Sony. Since 2006, he has been managed by Kronekodow, Sheena's personal management agency. The pair have collaborated musically several times. In 2002, they covered three songs in English: Marvin Gaye's \"The Onion Song\" for Sheena's album Utaite My\u014dri, \"Where Is the Love\" (originally performed by Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway) for Junpei Shiina's album Discover, and Toto's \"Georgy Porgy.\" \"Georgy Porgy\" was recorded as a part of a special unit called Yokoshima, featuring Jumpei Shiina on keyboards and Ringo Sheena on chorus. In 2007, the pair sang a duet on her single \"Kono Yo no Kagiri.\"\nIn November 2000, Sheena married guitarist Junji Yayoshi, who was a member of her backing band Gyakutai Glycogen. Sheena gave birth to a son in July 2001. The pair then later divorced in January 2002.\nIn September 2013, gossip magazine Josei Jishin published an article that linked her romantically with music director Yuichi Kodama and stating that she was secretly giving birth to her second child. Sheena addressed these rumours publicly during her T\u014dtaikai concerts in November 2013, announcing that she gave birth in spring of 2013 to a girl. As this was close to the release of her single \"Irohanihoheto/Kodoku no Akatsuki,\" she did not feel it was appropriate to link the birth of her daughter with single promotions, so decided not to announce it at the time. The footage of her announcement was released on her T\u014dtaikai DVD in March 2014.\n\n\n== Musical instruments ==\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nMuzai Moratorium (1999)\nSh\u014dso Strip (2000)\nUtaite My\u014dri (2002)\nKalk Samen Kuri no Hana (2003)\nHeisei F\u016bzoku (2007)\nSanmon Gossip (2009)\nGyakuyuny\u016b: K\u014dwankyoku (2014)\nHi Izuru Tokoro (2014)\nGyakuyuny\u016b: K\u014dk\u016bkyoku (2017)\n\n\n== Solo tours and concerts ==\nSenk\u014d Ecstasy (\u5148\u653b\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc, \"Pre-emptive Strike Ecstasy\") (1999)\nManabiya Ecstasy (\u5b66\u820e\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc, \"School Ecstasy\") (1999)\nGekokuj\u014d Xstasy (2000)\nGokiritsu Japon (2000)\nZazen Extasy (2000)\nBaish\u014d Ecstasy (\u8ce3\u7b11\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc, \"Prostitute Ecstasy\") (2003)\nSugoroku Ecstasy (2003)\nDai Ikkai Ringo-han Taikai: Adults Only (\u7b2c1\u56de\u6797\u6a8e\u73ed\u5927\u4f1a \u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc, \"Adults Only: The First Members-Only Extravaganza for the Ringo Squad Fan Club\") (2005)\n(Nama) Ringo-haku '08: J\u016bsh\u016bnen Kinen-sai ((\u751f)\u6797\u6a8e\u535a'08 \uff5e10\u5468\u5e74\u8a18\u5ff5\u796d\uff5e, \"Ringo Expo '08: 10 Year Anniversary Meet\") (2008)\nT\u014dtaikai: Heisei Nij\u016bgo-nen Kaneyama-ch\u014d Taikai (\u515a\u5927\u4f1a \u5e73\u6210\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u795e\u5c71\u753a\u5927\u4f1a, \"The Party Convention: 2013 Kamiyama Event\") (2013)\nHantaikai: Heisei Nij\u016bgo-nen Hamariky\u016b Taikai (\u73ed\u5927\u4f1a \u5e73\u6210\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\u6d5c\u96e2\u5bae\u5927\u4f1a, \"The Squad Convention: 2013 Hamariky\u016b Event\") (2013)\nChotto Shita Recohatsu 2014 (\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3068\u3057\u305f\u30ec\u30b3\u767a 2014, \"A Little Release Party 2014\") (2014)\nRingo Haku '14: Toshionna no Gyakush\u016b (\u6797\u6a8e\u535a'14 -\u5e74\u5973\u306e\u9006\u8972-, \"Ringo Expo '14: Counter-attack of the Chinese Astrological Woman of the Year\") (2014)\n\n\n=== Backing bands ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial website of Sheena Ringo at Universal Music Japan (in Japanese)",

            ], 
            "content": "Diamond cutting is the practice of changing a diamond from a rough stone into a faceted gem. Cutting diamond requires specialized knowledge, tools, equipment, and techniques because of its extreme difficulty.\nThe first guild of diamond cutters and polishers (diamantaire) was formed in 1375 in Nuremberg, Germany, and led to the development of various types of \"cut\". This has two meanings in relation to diamonds. The first is the shape: square, oval, and so on. The second relates to the specific quality of cut within the shape, and the quality and price will vary greatly based on the cut quality. Since diamonds are one of the hardest materials, special diamond-coated surfaces are used to grind the diamond down. The first major development in diamond cutting came with the \"Point Cut\" during the later half of the 14th century: the Point Cut follows the natural shape of an octahedral rough diamond crystal, eliminating some waste in the cutting process.\nDiamond cutting, as well as overall processing, is concentrated in a few cities around the world. The main diamond trading centers are Antwerp, Tel Aviv, and Dubai from where roughs are sent to the main processing centers of India and China. Diamonds are cut and polished in Surat, India and the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen. India in recent years has held between 19\u201331% of the world market in polished diamonds and China has held 17% of the world market share in a recent year. Another important diamond center is New York City.\n\n\n== Diamond cutting process ==\nThe diamond cutting process includes these steps; planning, cleaving or sawing, bruting, polishing, and final inspection.\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nDiamond manufacturers analyze diamond rough from an economic perspective, with two objectives steering decisions made about how a faceted diamond will be cut. The first objective is that of maximum return on investment for the piece of diamond rough. The second is how quickly the finished diamond can be sold. Scanning devices are used to get a 3-dimensional computer model of the rough stone. Also, inclusions are photographed and placed on the 3D model, which is then used to find an optimal way to cut the stone.\n\n\n==== Maximizing value ====\n\nThe process of maximizing the value of finished diamonds, from a rough diamond into a polished gemstone, is both an art and a science. The choice of cut is influenced by many factors. Market factors include the exponential increase in value of diamonds as weight increases, referred to as weight retention, and the popularity of certain shapes amongst consumers. Physical factors include the original shape of the rough stone, and location of the inclusions and flaws to be eliminated.\n\n\n===== Weight retention =====\nThe weight retention analysis studies the diamond rough to find the best combination of finished stones as it relates to per carat value. For instance, a 2.20 carat (440 mg) octahedron may produce (i) either two half carat (100 mg) diamonds whose combined value may be higher than that of (ii) a 0.80 carat (160 mg) diamond + 0.30 carat (60 mg) diamond that could be cut from the same rough diamond.\nThe round brilliant cut and square brilliant cuts are preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly shaped crystals, such as macles are more likely to be cut in a fancy cut\u2014that is, a cut other than the round brilliant\u2014which the particular crystal shape lends itself to.\nEven with modern techniques, the cutting and polishing of a diamond crystal always results in a dramatic loss of weight, about 50%. Sometimes the cutters compromise and accept lesser proportions and symmetry in order to avoid inclusions or to preserve the weight. Since the per-carat price of a diamond shifts around key milestones (such as 1.00 carat), many one-carat (200 mg) diamonds are the result of compromising Cut quality for Carat weight.\n\n\n===== Color retention =====\n\nIn colored diamonds, cutting can influence the color grade of the diamond, thereby raising its value. Certain cut shapes are used to intensify the color of the diamond. The radiant cut is an example of this type of cut.\nNatural green color diamonds most often have merely a surface coloration caused by natural irradiation, which does not extend through the stone. For this reason green diamonds are cut with significant portions of the original rough diamond's surface (naturals) left on the finished gem. It is these naturals that provide the color to the diamond.\n\n\n==== Turnaround minimization ====\nThe other consideration of diamond planning is how quickly a diamond will sell. This consideration is often unique to the type of manufacturer. While a certain cutting plan may yield a better value, a different plan may yield diamonds that will sell sooner, providing an earlier return on the investment.\n\n\n=== Cleaving or sawing ===\nCleaving is the separation of a piece of diamond rough into separate pieces, to be finished as separate gems.\nSawing is the use of a diamond saw or laser to cut the diamond rough into separate pieces.\n\n\n=== Bruting ===\nBruting is the art of cutting a diamond round. In the modern era diamonds are rounded using either a laser; a diamond disk, impregnated with diamonds; or two diamonds cutting against each other. Industrial diamonds can also be used for bruting a diamond round. Modern computer software measures the roundness of each diamond and \"Ideal Cut\" diamonds have to round within a 10th of a millimeter to qualify as an excellent cut diamond.\n\n\n=== Diamond Polishing ===\n\nDiamond polishing is the final polishing of the diamond. In a diamond factory one would find a diamond \"Crossworker\" who first places the main facets on a diamond (Blocking the diamond). This is done to ensure maximum weight, clarity and best angles for the specific shape of diamond. After initial crossworking is complete, the diamond is finalized by smoothing the main facets by the crossworker, which is known as polishing the diamond. After the main facets have been polished by the crossworker, the final facets are polished onto the diamond by a \"Brillianteer.\" The facets added are the stars, top and bottom halves also known as upper and lower girdle facets\n\n\n=== Final inspection ===\nThe final stage involves thoroughly cleaning the diamond in acids, and examining the diamond to see whether it meets the quality standards of the manufacturer.\n\n\n== Cutting process ==\nIt is possible only because the hardness of diamond varies widely according to the direction in which one is trying to cut or grind.\nA simplified round brilliant cut process includes the following stages:\nPlanning \u2013 Modern day planning of a diamond is done using computer software.\nMarking \u2013 Outlining the best possible shape and cut of the diamond.\nSawing the rough stone \u2013 depending on the shape of rough diamond as not all diamonds are sawn.\nTable\nBruting the girdle.\nBlocking 8 main pavilion facets \u2013 these facets are divided into 4 Corners and 4 pavilions as the corners and pavilions run in different directions due to the atomic structure of the diamond.\nCrown \u2013 the crown consist of 8 main facets and are divided into 4 Corners and 4 Bezels.\nFinal bruting \u2013 ensuring the diamonds girdle is perfectly round and smooth.\nPolishing all 16 main facets.\nBrillianteering \u2013 Adding and polishing 8 stars and 16 pavilion and 16 crown halves.\nQuality Control \u2013 checking for symmetry, polish and cut (angles) after the diamond is completed.\nThis is just one, although a fairly common way of creating a round brilliant cut. The actual process also includes many more stages depending on the size and quality of the rough stone. For example, bigger stones are first scanned to get the three-dimensional shape, which is then used to find the optimal usage. The scanning may be repeated after each stage and bruting may be done in several steps, each bringing the girdle closer to the final shape.\n\n\n== Recutting ==\nDue to changes in market desirability and popularity, the value of different styles of diamond fluctuate. All diamonds can be recut into new shapes that will increase value at that time in the market and desirability. An example of this is the marquise cut diamond which was popular in the 1970s to 1980s. In later decades, jewelers had little success in selling this shape in comparison to other shapes like the oval or pear shape. The marquise can be cut into an oval diamond by any diamond cutter with a loss of 5-10% in total weight. For example, a 1.10 carat marquise shape would be a 1.00 oval cut diamond by rounding the sharp points and creating an oval which currently in the market has a much greater desirability and resale value. The same marquise shape also could become a pear shape instead by only trimming and rounding the side which will be turned into the base of the pear shape.\nIn the 18th century there was a trend for recutting Indian diamonds to suit English tastes. The Koh-i-Noor's original cut weighed a little over 186.00 carats. When it was recut to an oval-shapped brilliant, almost 80 carats were lost.\nOther aspects are affected in recutting for value as well, such as the clarity. If an original shape contained inclusions on the tips, the recut would yield an increase in clarity since trimming down to a new shape would yield a cleaner overall finished diamond.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCut (gems)\nDiamond\nDiamond cut\nBrilliant (diamond cut)\nPrincess cut\n\nFaceting machine\nGemcutter\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAntique Jewelry University \u2013 A History of Diamond Cutting\nDiamond Design, Marcel Tolkowsky.

            "content": "The eyespot apparatus (or stigma) is a photoreceptive organelle found in the flagellate or (motile) cells of green algae and other unicellular photosynthetic organisms such as euglenids. It allows the cells to sense light direction and intensity and respond to it by swimming either towards the light (positive phototaxis) or away from the light (negative phototaxis). A related response (\"photoshock\" or photophobic response) occurs when cells are briefly exposed to high light intensity, causing the cell to stop, briefly swim backwards, then change swimming direction. Eyespot-mediated light perception helps the cells in finding an environment with optimal light conditions for photosynthesis. Eyespots are the simplest and most common \"eyes\" found in nature, composed of photoreceptors and areas of bright orange-red pigment granules. Signals relayed from the eyespot photoreceptors result in alteration of the beating pattern of the flagella, generating a phototactic response.\n\n\n== Microscopic structure ==\nUnder the light microscope, eyespots appear as dark, orange-reddish spots or stigmata. They get their color from carotenoid pigments contained in bodies called pigment granules. The photoreceptors are found in the plasma membrane overlaying the pigmented bodies.\nThe eyespot apparatus of Euglena comprises the paraflagellar body connecting the eyespot to the flagellum. In electron microscopy, the eyespot apparatus appears as a highly ordered lamellar structure formed by membranous rods in a helical arrangement.\nIn Chlamydomonas, the eyespot is part of the chloroplast and takes on the appearance of a membranous sandwich structure. It is assembled from chloroplast membranes (outer, inner, and thylakoid membranes) and carotenoid-filled granules overlaid by plasma membrane. The stacks of granules act as a quarter-wave plate, reflecting incoming photons back to the overlying photoreceptors, while shielding the photoreceptors from light coming from other directions. It disassembles during cell division and reforms in the daughter cells in an asymmetric fashion in relation to the cytoskeleton. This asymmetric positioning of the eyespot in the cell is essential for proper phototaxis.\n\n\n== Eyespot proteins ==\nThe most critical eyespot proteins are the photoreceptor proteins that sense light. The photoreceptors found in unicellular organisms fall into two main groups: flavoproteins and retinylidene proteins (rhodopsins). Flavoproteins are characterized by containing flavin molecules as chromophores, whereas retinylidene proteins contain retinal. The photoreceptor protein in Euglena is likely a flavoprotein. In contrast, Chlamydomonas phototaxis is mediated by archaeal-type rhodopsins.\nBesides photoreceptor proteins, eyespots contain a large number of structural, metabolic and signaling proteins. The eyespot proteome of Chlamydomonas cells consists of roughly 200 different proteins.\n\n\n== Photoreception and signal transduction ==\nThe Euglena photoreceptor was identified as a blue-light-activated adenylyl cyclase. Excitation of this receptor protein results in the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a second messenger. Chemical signal transduction ultimately triggers changes in flagellar beat patterns and cell movement.\nThe archaeal-type rhodopsins of Chlamydomonas contain an all-trans retinylidene chromatophore which undergoes photoisomerization to a 13-cis isomer. This activates a photoreceptor channel, leading to a change in membrane potential and cellular calcium ion concentration. Photoelectric signal transduction ultimately triggers changes in flagellar strokes and thus cell movement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOcelloid\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Catgut suture is a type of surgical suture that is naturally degraded by the body's own proteolytic enzymes. Absorption is complete by 90 days, and full tensile strength remains for at least 7 days. This eventual disintegration makes it good for use in rapidly healing tissues and in internal structures that cannot be re-accessed for suture removal.\nCatgut suture has high knot-pull tensile strength and good knot security due to special excellent handling features. It is used for all surgical procedures including general closure, ophthalmic, orthopedics, obstetrics/gynecology and gastrointestinal surgery. It is absorbed faster in patients with cancer, anemia, and malnutrition. It also absorbed faster when used in the mouth and the vagina, due to the presence of microorganisms.\nCatgut has largely been replaced by synthetic absorbable polymers such as Vicryl and polydioxanone. It is not used at all for human surgery in some countries. In Europe and Japan, gut sutures have been banned due to concerns that they could transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease), although the herds from which gut is harvested are certified BSE-free.\n\n\n== Manufacture ==\nCatgut suture is made by twisting together strands of purified collagen taken from the serosal or submucosal layer of the small intestine of healthy ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) or from beef tendon. The natural plain thread is precision ground in order to achieve a monofilament character and treated with a glycerol-containing solution. The suture is sterilized with a sterilizing fluid containing ethylene oxide, isopropyl alcohol and distilled water. Catgut suture is straw-colored, and is available in sizes USP 6-0 (1 metric) to USP 3 (7 metric). Although the name implies the usage of guts of cats, there is no record of feline guts being used for this purpose. The word catgut is deived from the term kitgut or kitstring (the string used on a kit, or fiddle). Misinterpretation of the word kit as referring to a young cat led to the use of the term catgut. Surgical gut is in fact made from the submucosa of sheep intestine or the serosa of bovine intestine and is approximately 90% collagen. Perhaps another possible explanation of the name is the combination of the words cattle and gut. B Braun Medical AG, a German Multi National company first industrialized catgut suture and Catgut is a brand registered with B Braun.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nCatgut Chrome (B Braun) suture is a variant treated with chromic acid salts. This treatment produces roughly twice the stitch-holding time of plain catgut, but greater tissue inflammation occurs. Full tensile strength is extended to 18\u201321 days. It is brown rather than straw-colored, and has improved smoothness due to the dry presentation of the thread (plain catgut is wet). It is otherwise similar to plain catgut.\nFast catgut suture is heat-treated to give even more rapid absorption in the body.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first known absorbable sutures were made of the intestines of sheep. The manufacturing process was similar to that of natural musical strings for violins and guitar, and also of natural strings for tennis racquets.\nGut strings were being used as medical sutures as early as the 3rd century AD as Galen, a prominent Greek physician from the Roman Empire, is known to have used them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Suture at Wikimedia Commons",

After Castro Jij\u00f3n turned over power to army high command, the high command appointed Clemente Yerovi as president of the civilian junta. As the leader of the army high command, Vargas is considered by some to have briefly served as head of state of Ecuador. He died on 9 August 2013 at the age of 100. From 12 June 2012, when former Somali President Sheikh Mukhtar Mohamed Hussein died until his own death, Vargas was the world's oldest living former head of state.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Squalius carolitertii is a species of fresh-water fish in the family Cyprinidae. It is found in Portugal and Spain, and known there as the bordallo, escalo or gallego.\nIts natural habitats are rivers and intermittent rivers. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe Northern Iberian chub, Squalius carolitertii (Doadrio, 1988), is a small endemic cyprinid inhabiting the rivers of the Iberian Peninsula across a large area, including the Douro, Mondego, Lima, Minho, and L\u00e9rez basins. Recently several researchers have reported this species for the first time from the upper reaches of the Alberche River (a tributary of the Tagus basin in central Spain) and in the Oitav\u00e9n River (a tributary of the Verdugo River in northwestern Spain).\n\n\n== Diet ==\nS. carolitertii is an omnivorous fish feeding predominantly on aquatic invertebrates, being nymphs of Baetis spp. the most abundant prey, although detritus is an important food item. Moreover, in S. carolitertii, as in many other fish species, there is normally a change in the diet composition during the life of the fish, and these age-related diet shifts occur at three different levels: (1) frequency of occurrence of detritus decreases with fish age; (2) prey selection varies with fish age; and (3) mean prey size increases as fish size increased.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCrivelli, A.J. 2005.

This concept is extensively used in radio astronomy and planetary science.\nThe brightness temperature is not a temperature as ordinarily understood. It characterizes radiation, and depending on the mechanism of radiation can differ considerably from the physical temperature of a radiating body (though it is theoretically possible to construct a device which will heat up by a source of radiation with some brightness temperature to the actual temperature equal to brightness temperature). Nonthermal sources can have very high brightness temperatures. In pulsars the brightness temperature can reach 1026 K. For the radiation of a typical helium\u2013neon laser with a power of 60 mW and a coherence length of 20 cm, focused in a spot with a diameter of 10 \u00b5m, the brightness temperature will be nearly 14\u00d7109 K.\n\nFor a black body, Planck's law gives:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            \u03bd\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              h\n              \n                \u03bd\n                \n                  3\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              \n                e\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      h\n                      \u03bd\n                    \n                    \n                      k\n                      T\n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \u2212\n              1\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{\\nu }={\\frac {2h\\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}{\\frac {1}{e^{\\frac {h\\nu }{kT}}-1}}}\n  \n\nwhere\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          I\n          \n            \u03bd\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I_{\\nu }}\n   (the Intensity or Brightness) is the amount of energy emitted per unit surface area per unit time per unit solid angle and in the frequency range between \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bd\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu }\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bd\n        +\n        d\n        \u03bd\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu +d\\nu }\n  ; \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n   is the temperature of the black body; \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   is Planck's constant; \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bd\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nu }\n   is frequency; \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c}\n   is the speed of light; and \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   is Boltzmann's constant.\nFor a grey body the spectral radiance is a portion of the black body radiance, determined by the emissivity \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03f5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\epsilon }\n  .

            "content": "The Westminster Memorial Hospital is a small community hospital in Shaftesbury, Dorset, England. It provides about 20 in-patient beds, a minor injuries department, a range of out-patient clinics and other support services. It opened in 1874.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1871, some two years after the death of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, his wife, Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower, and one daughter gave a plot of land for the construction of a hospital in her husband's memory. He had long connections with Shaftesbury, owning much property in the vicinity. The family lived in Motcombe for part of the year and the Marquess died in the new Fonthill Abbey, Fonthill Gifford, some 10 miles from Shaftesbury. The foundation stone was laid in May 1871 by Lady Theodora Grosvenor, and three years later the hospital was inaugurated by George Moberly, Bishop of Salisbury. The design of the building was by J B Corby of Stamford, Lincolnshire and the hospital was constructed by a Shaftesbury man, Mr C J Miles.\nThe funding of the hospital's six beds in its early days was through subscribers (a guinea annually or a lifetime payment of \u00a320). Patients were subject to a modest fee and there was a small income from an endowment fund provided by the Grosvenor family. No parish poor were admitted but instead were cared for in the local workhouse infirmary. Local family doctors provided medical cover with a matron managing the nursing staff.\nIn 1907 the first major addition to the hospital was a small operating theatre, funded by Lady Theodora in memory of her mother, deceased some 16 years previously. Local doctors had suggested the theatre and it was built as an extension on the west side of the hospital with a double lantern roof to admit full light. Further development followed with central heating installed in 1909 and an X-ray facility, after some delay, in 1919. To assist with the funding of the hospital the Shaftesbury Carnival Committee donated money from the annual carnival. In 1924 there was a meeting with representatives of the Salisbury Infirmary regarding affiliation. 1928 saw the inauguration of the Hospital League, an adjunct organisation to which subscribers paid to qualify for treatment at the hospital. In 1930 a major enlargement to the hospital was opened by Lord Evelyn Seymour and his wife Lady Edith Seymour, the Duchess of Somerset; this provided more bed space and accommodation for staff. The out-patients department was added in 1938 and in the same year there was an agreement to join the Salisbury Hospital Group.\nIn 1948, Castle Hill House was purchased and converted into a small maternity unit which was managed by the Matron from the WMH and local doctors. It functioned until the early 1980s when it closed and was later sold.\n\n\n== Management ==\nOriginally the hospital was managed by a committee of local medical practitioners and worthies, with the day-to-day running managed by a matron. In 1938 the hospital became part of the Salisbury Hospital Group. In 1986 it became part of the Salisbury Community NHS Trust and remained so until 2001, when its management and development was taken over by what is now Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust. In 2007 a review of the hospital was undertaken, with the aim of closing or redeveloping the facility. There was a full public consultation and the decision was to further develop the services available on-site.\n\n\n== Recent fabric developments ==\nIn the early 1980s, a further extension was added to the southeast corner of the hospital in the form of an octagon. This 10-bed ward was used for the assessment and rehabilitation of elderly people under the care of a specialist consultant from Salisbury Hospital. It has since closed and is used as a meeting room and base for community services. A purpose-designed extension was built on the north side of the hospital in 1988 to provide improved accommodation for the physiotherapy services. The hospital has a very active and successful League of Friends, formed in 1950, which raises money to fund projects that have a lower priority on the NHS budget.\n\n\n== Present day services ==\nThe Westminster Memorial Hospital at present (2013) provides:\nBeds for Elderly Care Rehabilitation, GP Medical Admissions and direct admissions\nA minor injury unit open during the day only\nDay facilities\nPhysiotherapy and Occupational Therapy\nA radiology department\nA wide range of out-patient clinics\nAccommodation for some community services, including mental health, palliative care and community rehabilitation\n\n\n== See also ==\nHealthcare in Dorset\nList of hospitals in England\n\n\n== References ==",

The Sanfilippo syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis III, is a lysosomal storage disease due to impaired degradation of heparan sulfate. MPS III includes 4 types, each due to the deficiency of a different enzyme: heparan N-sulfatase (type A); alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (type B; MIM 252920); acetyl CoA:alpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase (type C; MIM 252930); and N-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase (type D; MIM 252940). The Sanfilippo syndrome is characterized by severe central nervous system degeneration, but only mild somatic disease. Onset of clinical features usually occurs between 2 and 6 years; severe neurologic degeneration occurs in most patients between 6 and 10 years of age, and death occurs typically during the second or third decade of life. Type A has been reported to be the most severe, with earlier onset and rapid progression of symptoms and shorter survival.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

Mosher, first published in 2008. \"Population Control\" is a detailed exposition on the global effort to combat overpopulation, arguing that not only population control is immoral in many cases, and that overpopulation is a myth.\nMosher was first exposed to population control policies when he visited China as an undergraduate sociologist in 1979 to conduct anthropological research. While there, he witnessed the implementation of China\u2019s one child policy in the Guangdong providence firsthand.\nMosher questions the standard Malthusian idea that overpopulation is a threat to human happiness and survival.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHuman population control\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPop.org",

            "content": "Laura J. Alber (born September 7, 1968) is an American businesswoman who in 2010 became the CEO of Williams-Sonoma, Inc.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nAlber earned a B.A. in psychology from the University of Pennsylvania. While attending Penn, Alber had a small business selling velvet floppy hats. She said she got the idea after observing the floppy hat trend while a student at the University of Edinburgh. As a student, she took a wide range of classes, which she has said later served her well as a business executive. After graduation from Penn, Alber drove to California with no plan and took a series of odd jobs until taking an entry level job at Gap Inc.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShe joined Williams-Sonoma in 1995 as a senior buyer in the Pottery Barn subsidiary brand. Alber was promoted several times. She has said that her most important job, prior to becoming CEO of Williams-Sonoma, was serving as director of the Pottery Barn catalog, giving her the opportunity to \u201cown\u201d a business line from start to finish. She later became president of Pottery Barn, serving in that capacity from 2002 to 2006.\nAlber moved to the newly created role of president of Williams-Sonoma in 2006, where she continued her lead of Pottery Barn and the company's global supply chain, distribution, and worldwide logistics.\nIn 2010, she was elected to the company's board and named as CEO, replacing retiring W. Howard Lester.\nAt that time, she was the 10th highest paid woman in U.S. business, with an estimated compensation of $13,555,412.\nShe has said she enjoys the intellectual challenge of understanding the changing trends and global influences on the home. After being pregnant with her first daughter, Alber said she was inspired to create Pottery Barn Kids, providing home furnishings for children's spaces. Alber also led the creation of the Pottery Barn Bed+Bath, PBteen, and Threads brands. In 2011, the San Francisco Business Times named her one of the most influential women in San Francisco.\nUnder Alber's leadership, Williams-Sonoma became one of the largest U.S. e-tailers, selling about half of its $5 billion annual sales online in 2014. During her tenure, Williams-Sonoma launched its first app - \"Recipe of the Day\" - and partnered with YouTube to offer shoppable online videos. Alber has also promoted in-store events at Williams-Sonoma, including book signings and panini-making classes. In 2014 and 2015, Fortune (magazine) named Alber a \"Business Person of the Year.\"\nIn 2014, Alber wrote a Harvard Business Review article, advocating for blending art and science in business by informing creative ideas with analytics.\n\n\n== Personal ==\nLaura is married with three children. She was a member of the advisory board of the Richardson Bay Audubon Center.\nShe is on the board of overseers for the College of Arts & Science at The University of Pennsylvania. She and her husband also created the Alber-Klingelhofer Endowed Scholarship at Penn. In 2014, Alber was the graduation speaker at the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, where she encouraged \"present mindedness\" which she defined as focusing on doing what you love, rather than only planning for it.\nShe became a member of the board of directors of Fitbit in 2016.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Kevin Finney (born 19 October 1969) is an English former footballer who played as a midfielder for Port Vale, Lincoln City, Leek Town, and Stafford Rangers.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nFinney came up through the Port Vale youth team to sign as a professional in May 1987. He featured 22 times in the 1987\u201388 campaign, and scored the only goal of the game against Macclesfield Town to book the \"Valiants\" an FA Cup tie with First Division giants Tottenham Hotspur. This goal was reported to have kept manager John Rudge in his job, who went on to become the club's most successful ever manager. However, Rudge used Finney mainly as a substitute in 17 games in the 1988\u201389 season. He scored his first league goal on the last day of the Third Division season: a 2\u20131 win over Fulham at Craven Cottage on 13 May. He appeared as a substitute for Andy Porter in the 1\u20130 win over Bristol Rovers at Vale Park on 3 June, in the second leg of the play-off final. However his first team opportunities became more limited in the Second Division, and he featured just nine times in the 1989\u201390 season. He appeared just once, in the League Cup, in the 1990\u201391 campaign, and was handed a free transfer to Steve Thompson's Lincoln City in May 1991. The \"Imps\" posted a tenth-place finish in the Fourth Division in 1991\u201392, before finishing outside the play-offs on goal difference in 1992\u201393. He scored two goals in 37 league appearances during his two seasons at Sincil Bank. Finney then moved into non-league football, and featured in the Northern Premier League with Leek Town and in the Conference with Stafford Rangers.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nSource:\n\n\n== Honours ==\nwith Port Vale\nFootball League Third Division play-off winner: 1989\n\n\n== References ==",

It broadcasts a high-definition digital signal on UHF channel 39 (or virtual channel 2.1 via PSIP) from a transmitter at \u00c9difice Marie-Guyart in Downtown Quebec City.\nOwned by V Media Group, a Remstar company, its studios are located on De Vallier Street East and Rue Dorchester in Downtown Quebec City. This station can also be seen on Vid\u00e9otron channel 5 and in high definition on digital channel 605.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe station signed on along with sister station CFJP-TV in Montreal in 1986 as part of what was then the TQS network. It was owned by the family of Jean Pouliot, then-owner of CFCF-TV. The A in the callsign stands for Ad\u00e9lard, Pouliot's middle name.\nOriginally a full satellite of CFJP, it began airing its own programming on September 3, 1989. However, like all other TQS/V stations, it was (and still is) largely a semi-satellite of CFJP. As an owned-and-operated station of the network, CFAP was part of the takeover of TQS by Remstar Corporation.\n\n\n== Digital television ==\nCFAP-DT ceased broadcasting in analog on August 17, 2011 and signed on to digital on August 27, 2011. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display CFAP-TV's virtual channel as 2.1.\n\n\n== External links ==\nV (in French)\nCFAP-DT history \u2013 Canadian Communications Foundation\nQuery the REC's Canadian station database for CFAP-TV\nQuery TV Fool's coverage map for CFAP",

It is self-reported or can be recorded by a care-giver.\nThe sleep diary, or sleep log, is a tool used by doctors and patients. It is a useful resource in the diagnosis and treatment of especially circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and in monitoring whether treatment of those and other sleep disorders is successful.\nSleep diaries may be used in conjunction with actigraphy.\nIn addition to being a useful tool for medical professionals in the diagnosis of sleep problems, a sleep diary can help make individuals more aware of the parameters affecting their sleep. This data alone can help people self-diagnose what helps them get a good sleep.\n\n\n== Components ==\nThe information contained in a sleep diary includes some or all of the following points:\nThe time the person had wanted or intended to wake up\nThe time the person woke up\nWhether the person woke up spontaneously, by an alarm clock, or because of another (specified) disturbance\nThe time the person got out of bed\nA few words about how the person felt during the day (mood, drowsiness, etc.), often on a scale from 1 to 5 and the major cause\nThe start and end times of any daytime naps and exercises\nThe name, dosage and time of any drugs used including medication, sleep aids, caffeine and alcohol\nThe time and type/ heaviness of evening meal\nActivities the last hour before bedtime, such as meditation, watching TV, playing PC-games\nStress level before bedtime, often on a scale from 1 to 5 and the major cause\nThe time the person tried to fall asleep\nThe time the person thinks sleep onset occurred\nActivity during aforementioned two moments (remaining eyes closed, meditating, ...)\nThe presumed cause, number, time, and length of any nighttime awakenings and activities during these moments\nQuality of sleep\nLevel of comfort of any recalled good or bad dreams\n\n\n== Data collection ==\nSleep logs are often hand-drawn on graph paper, as a rule one week per page.

            "content": "The Women's World Chess Championship (WWCC) is played to determine the women's world champion in chess. Like the World Chess Championship, it is administered by FIDE.\nUnlike with most sports recognized by the International Olympic Committee, where competition is either \"mixed\" (containing everyone) or split into men and women, in chess women are both allowed to compete in the \"open\" division (including the World Chess Championship) yet also have a separate Women's Championship (only open to females).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Era of Menchik ===\nThe Women's World Championship was established by FIDE in 1927 as a single tournament held alongside the Chess Olympiad. The winner of that tournament, Vera Menchik, did not have any special rights as the men's champion did\u2014instead she had to defend her title by playing as many games as all the challengers. She did this successfully in every other championship in her lifetime (1930, 1931, 1933, 1935, 1937 and 1939).\n\n\n=== Dominance of the Soviet Union players (1950\u20131991) ===\n\nMenchik died, still champion, in 1944 in a German air raid on Kent. The next championship was another round-robin tournament in 1949\u201350 and was won by Lyudmila Rudenko. Thereafter a system similar to that of the men's championship was established, with a cycle of Candidates events (and later Interzonals) to pick a challenger to face the reigning champion.\nThe first such Candidates tournament was held in Moscow, 1952. Elisaveta Bykova won and proceeded to defeat Rudenko with seven wins, five losses, and two draws to become the third champion. The next Candidates tournament was won by Olga Rubtsova. Instead of directly playing Bykova, however, FIDE decided that the championship should be held between the three top players in the world. Rubtsova won at Moscow in 1956, one-half point ahead of Bykova, who finished five points ahead of Rudenko. Bykova regained the title in 1958 and defended it against Kira Zvorykina, winner of a Candidates tournament, in 1959.\nThe fourth Candidates tournament was held in 1961 in Vrnjacka Banja, and was utterly dominated by Nona Gaprindashvili of Georgia, who won with ten wins, zero losses, and six draws. She then decisively defeated Bykova with seven wins, no losses, and four draws in Moscow, 1962 to become champion. Gaprindashvili defended her title against Alla Kushnir of Russia at Riga 1965 and Tbilisi/Moscow 1969. In 1972, FIDE introduced the same system for the women's championship as with the men's: a series of Interzonal tournaments, followed by the Candidates matches. Kushnir won again, only to be defeated by Gaprindashvili at Riga 1972. Gaprindashvili defended the title one last time against Nana Alexandria of Georgia at Pitsunda/Tbilisi 1975.\nIn 1976\u20131978 Candidates cycle, 17-year-old Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia ended up the surprise star, defeating Nana Alexandria, Elena Akhmilovskaya, and Alla Kushnir to face Gaprindashvili in the 1978 finals at Tbilisi. Chiburdanidze proceeded to soundly defeat Gaprindashvili, marking the end of one Georgian's domination and the beginning of another's. Chiburdanidze defended her title against Alexandria at Borjomi/Tbilisi 1981 and Irina Levitina at Volgograd 1984. Following this, FIDE reintroduced the Candidates tournament system. Akhmilovskaya, who had earlier lost to Chiburdanidze in the Candidates matches, won the tournament was but was still defeated by Chiburdanidze at Sofia 1986. Chiburdanidze's final title defense came against Nana Ioseliani at Telavi 1988.\n\n\n=== Post-Soviet era (1991\u20132010) ===\nChiburdanidze's domination ended in Manila 1991, where the young Chinese star Xie Jun defeated her, after finishing second to the still-active Gaprindashvili in an Interzonal, tying with Alisa Mari\u0107 in the Candidates tournament, and then beating Maric in a tie-breaker match.\nIt was during this time that the three Polgar sisters Susan (also known as Zsuzsa), Sofia (Zs\u00f3fia), and Judit emerged as dominant players. However they tended to compete in men's tournaments, avoiding the women's championship.\nSusan Polgar eventually changed her policy. She won the 1992 Candidates tournament in Shanghai. The Candidates final\u2014an eight-game match between the top two finishers in the tournament\u2014was a drawn match between Polgar and Ioseliani, even after two tiebreaks. The match was decided by a lottery, which Ioseliani won. She was then promptly crushed by Xie Jun (8\u200b1\u20442\u20132\u200b1\u20442) in the championship at Monaco 1993.\nThe next cycle was dominated by Polgar. She tied with Chiburdanidze in the Candidates tournament, defeated her easily in the match (5\u200b1\u20442\u20131\u200b1\u20442), and then decisively defeated Xie Jun (8\u200b1\u20442\u20134\u200b1\u20442) in Ja\u00e9n 1996 for the championship.\nIn 1997, Russian Alisa Galliamova and Chinese Xie Jun finished first and second, but Galliamova refused to play the final match entirely in China. FIDE eventually awarded the match to Xie Jun by default.\nHowever, by the time all these delays were sorted out, Polgar had given birth to her first child. She requested that the match be postponed. FIDE refused, and eventually set up the championship to be between Galliamova and Xie Jun. The championship was held in Kazan, Tatarstan and Shenyang, China, and Xie Jun won with five wins, three losses, and seven draws.\nIn 2000 a knock-out event, similar to the FIDE men's title and held alongside it, was the new format of the women's world championship. It was won by Xie Jun. In 2001 a similar event determined the champion, Zhu Chen. Another knock-out, this one held separately from the men's event, in Elista, the capital of the Russian republic of Kalmykia (of which FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov is president), from May 21 to June 8, 2004, produced Bulgarian Antoaneta Stefanova as champion. As with Polgar five years prior, Zhu Chen did not participate due to pregnancy.\nIn 2006 the title returned to China. Interestingly, the new champion Xu Yuhua was pregnant during the championship.\nIn 2008, the title went to Russian grandmaster Alexandra Kosteniuk, who, in the final, beat Chinese prodigy Hou Yifan 2\u200b1\u20442\u20131\u200b1\u20442, then aged 14 (see Women's World Chess Championship 2008).\nIn 2010 the title returned to China once again. Hou Yifan, the runner-up in the previous championship, became the youngest ever women's world champion at the age of 16. She beat her compatriot WGM Ruan Lufei 2\u20132 (classic) 3\u20131 (rapid playoffs).\n\n\n=== Yearly tournaments (2010\u2013present) ===\n\nBeginning from 2010, the Women's World Chess Championship would be held annually in alternating formats. In even years a 64-player knockout system would be used, in the odd years a classical match featuring only two players would be held. The 2011 edition was between the 2010 champion Hou Yifan and the winner of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2009\u20132011. Since Hou Yifan won the Grand Prix, her challenger was the runner-up, Koneru Humpy.\nIn 2011 Hou Yifan successfully defended her women's world champion title in the Women's World Chess Championship 2011 in Tirana, Albania against Koneru Humpy. Hou won three games and drew five in the ten-game match, winning the title with two games to spare.\nHou Yifan was knocked-out in the second round in Women's World Chess Championship 2012, which was played in Khanty Mansiysk. Anna Ushenina, seeded 30th in the tournament, won the final against Antoaneta Stefanova 3\u200b1\u20442\u20132\u200b1\u20442.\nThe Women's World Chess Championship 2013 was a match over 10 games between defending champion Anna Ushenina and Hou Yifan who had won the FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2011\u20132012. After seven of ten games Hou Yifan won the match 5.5 to 1.5 to retake the title.\nAfter Hou declined to defend her title at the Women's World Chess Championship 2015, the title was won by Mariya Muzychuk, who defeated Natalia Pogonina in the final.\nHou defeated Muzychuk 6-3 to reclaim the Women's World Chess Championship 2016 title for her 4th championship in March 2016.\n\n\n== Women's World Chess Champions ==\n\n\n== List of Women's World Chess Championships ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nDevelopment of the Women's World Chess Championship\nWorld Chess Championship\nWomen's World Team Chess Championship 2009\nList of female chess players\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe women's game, worldchess.com\nWCC for Women (Interzonal, Candidates, World Championship)\nA history of women's world chess champions\nChessbase report on 2006 championship",

            "content": "\"You and Me\" is a song recorded by Swiss group Takasa, a band composed of six members of the Swiss Salvation Army.\nWritten and produced by Georg Schlunegger for HitMill Records, the song competed in the Swiss national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2013, Die grosse Entscheidungs Show. After winning the selection organized by Schweizer Fernsehen, the German language division of the Swiss public broadcasting organization, on 15 December 2012 the song also won the national final, beating the remaining eight finalists.\nThe song's win has therefore qualified it to represent Switzerland at the 58th Annual Eurovision Song Contest in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. The band, known as Heilsarmee outside the contest, agreed to compete with a new name to gain acceptance by the contest, which does not allow any religious or political references in its entries or their songs. \"You and Me\" is a Pop Rock song with lyrics involving love and empowerment. It will be a part of the contest's second semi final, which will be held on May 16.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2012, the Swiss Salvation Army started considering the idea to participate in the national selection of Eurovision Song Contest 2013. According to the project manager of the Salvation Army, Martin K\u00fcnzi, competing in the Eurovision Song Contest was initially \"just a crazy idea\", but it was well received by many \"enthusiastic supporters\" within the Christian movement. The owner of the recording company HitMill, Roman Camenzinds, partnered with the Salavation Army to conduct the project. An internal casting was therefore held among the members of the Salvation Army, resulting in the selection of the six musicians of the band, named Heilsarmee. The members of the band\u2014Emil Ramsauer, Michael Sterckx, Katharina Hauri, Christoph Jakob, Sarah Breiter, Jonas Gygax\u2014are amateur musicians between 20 and 94 years old.\nIn early October 2012, it was announced that, after recording the song, Heilsarmee had submitted it to the SF regional selection through the official website of the German-language Swiss television. On 12 November 2012 the song was admitted the national final, after a voting process combining internet televotes and points awarded by a jury of industry experts. On 15 December 2012, \"You and me\" was therefore performed during Die grosse Entscheidungs Show. Heilsarmee's entry was the most voted song, thus beating the remaining eight contestants and being chosen to represent Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6, Sweden.\nThe selection of the song received some criticisms by German entertainer and LGBT rights activist Hella von Sinnen. According to von Sinnen, since the Salvation Army is a strict Christian organization with conservative opinions about LGBT rights, this could represent an obstacle for Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013, which has a strong gay and lesbian fanbase.\n\n\n== Track list ==\nDigital download\n\"You and Me\" \u2013 2:54\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTakasaEmil Ramsauer \u2013 double bass\nMichael Sterckx \u2013 trombone\nKatharina Hauri \u2013 drum, backing vocals\nChristoph Jakob \u2013 lead vocals, electric guitar\nSarah Breiter \u2013 vocals\nJonas Gygax \u2013 electric guitar\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "A nyckelharpa (Swedish: [\u00b2n\u028fk\u02d0\u025bl\u02ccharpa], \"keyed fiddle\", or literally \"key harp\", plural nyckelharpor) is a traditional Swedish musical instrument. It is a string instrument or chordophone. Its keys are attached to tangents which, when a key is depressed, serve as frets to change the pitch of the string.\nThe nyckelharpa is similar in appearance to a fiddle or the big Sorb geige or viol. Structurally, it is more closely related to the hurdy-gurdy, both employing key-actuated tangents to change the pitch. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nA depiction of two instruments, possibly but not confirmed nyckelharpor, can be found in a relief dating from circa 1350 on one of the gates of K\u00e4llunge church in Gotland. Early church paintings are found in Siena, Italy, dating to 1408 and in different churches in Denmark and Sweden, such as Tolfta church, Sweden, which dates to circa 1460-1525. Other very early pictures are to be found in Hildesheim, Germany, dating to circa 1590.\nThe Schl\u00fcsselfidel (nyckelharpa) is also mentioned in Theatrum Instrumentorum, a famous work written in 1620 by the German organist Michael Praetorius (1571\u20131621). The Swedish province of Uppland has been a stronghold for nyckelharpa music since the early 17th century, including musicians like Byss-Calle (Carl Ersson B\u00f6ssa, 1783\u20131847) from \u00c4lvkarleby.\nChanges by August Bohlin (1877\u20131949) in 1929/1930 made the nyckelharpa a chromatic instrument with a straight bow, making it a more violin-like and no longer a bourdon instrument. Composer, player and maker of nyckelharpas Eric Sahlstr\u00f6m (1912\u20131986) used this new instrument and helped to re-popularize it in the mid-20th century. In spite of this, the nyckelharpa's popularity declined until the 1960s roots revival.\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence in the popularity of the nyckelharpa, with notable artists such as Marco Ambrosini (Italy and Germany), Sture Sahlstr\u00f6m, Hasse Gille, Peter Puma Hedlund and Nils Nordstr\u00f6m including the nyckelharpa in both early music and contemporary music offerings. Continued refinement of the instrument also contributed to the increase in popularity, with instrument builders like Jean-Claude Condi and Annette Osann bringing innovation to the bow and body.\nIn 1990s, the nyckelharpa was recognised as one of the instruments available for study at the folk music department of the Royal College of Music in Stockholm (Kungliga Musikh\u00f6gskolan). It has also been a prominent part of several revival groups in the later part of the century, including the trio V\u00e4sen, the more contemporary group Hedningarna, the Finnish folk music group Hyperborea and the Swedish folk music groups Dr\u00e5m and Nordman. Elizabeth Weis Nord is a notable Nyckelharpa teacher and performer who resides the US. It has also been used in non-Scandinavian musical contexts, for example by the Spanish player Ana Alcaide.\n\n\n== Technique ==\n\nThe nyckelharpa is usually played with a strap around the neck, stabilised by the right arm. Didier Fran\u00e7ois, a violinist and nyckelharpist from Belgium, is noted for using an unusual playing posture, holding the nyckelharpa vertically in front of the chest. This allows a wider range of motion for both arms. It also affects the tone and sound of the instrument. Some players may use a violin bracket to keep the nyckelharpa away from the body so that it can swing freely, causing it to sound more \"open\" as its resonance is not dampened.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nThere are four common variants of the nyckelharpa still played today, differing in the number and arrangement of keys, number and arrangement of strings, and general body shape. The predominant type is the three-row so-called \"chromatic nyckelharpa\", with the melody strings tuned A1 - C1 - G, a drone C (from the highest to the lowest string) that is only touched occasionally, and 12 resonance strings (one for each step of the chromatic scale).\nThe resonance strings, or sympathetic strings, which were added to the instrument during the 2nd half of the 16th century, are not bowed directly but resonate with the other strings.\nTraditional variants of the nyckelharpa used to have one or more drone strings. This is not the case for modern chromatic nyckelharpor with three rows of keys for three melody strings and one bass string. But there are today also types with four or even five rows of keys.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nHardanger fiddle\nHurdy-gurdy\nMusic of Sweden\nMoraharpa\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe American Nyckelharpa Association\nNyckel-harpa.com (in German)\nInternational Days of the Nyckelharpa (Germany)\nNyckelharpa.eu\n\"Cadence\" - International cooperation in the teaching of the nyckelharpa, supported by the European Commission\nEric Sahlstr\u00f6m Institutet - National Folkmusic Institute in Sweden\nTrollf\u00e5geln (The Magic Bird) - SACD recording of the nyckelharpa played by Emilia Amper\nKornel Mariusz Radwanski plays The Alchemist's Dance on nyckelharpa with James Kline on archharp-guitar on YouTube\nE N C O R E European Nyckelharpa Cooperation - ORchestral Experience between European folk music and contemporary compositions, A Grundtvig workshop supported by European Commission about the music for Nyckelharpa\nThe UK Nyckelharpa Society",

            "content": "Otto K\u00fchne (12 May 1893 in Berlin \u2013 8 December 1955 in Brandenburg an der Havel) was a German communist militant, who led a maquis group of German antifascist fighters in the French region of Loz\u00e8re in 1943 and 1944 during World War II.\nA railwayman by profession, K\u00fchne had been a communist deputy during the Reichstag fire, and had subsequently fled to France.\n\n\n== The maquis de Loz\u00e8re ==\nAt the beginning of the war, K\u00fchne was interned by the Vichy regime and sent to a foreign workers' camp in Chanac in the Loz\u00e8re d\u00e9partement, where he formed a resistance group with former members of the International Brigades which was first attached to the Combat network in spring 1942. He was in contact with the leadership of the KPD and with the Lyon-based Free Germany Committee.\nIn spring 1942, K\u00fchne was one of the founders of the Maquis de Bonnecombe. At the time he used the false name \"Monsieur Schumann\" and attempted to develop contacts with the Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais. This was not without difficulties; his initial attempts were met with mistrust, for fear of infiltration by Gestapo moles. Nonetheless, the German anti-fascists found strong support among the Protestant-majority population of C\u00e9vennes.\nK\u00fchne quickly became the leader of this maquis, with a reputation for solidity, intransigence and inflexibility. He became the political officer for the \"Montaigne\" maquis which merged three German maquis at the beginning of 1944.\nK\u00fchne fought in the battles of 7\u20138 April 1944 at Saint-\u00c9tienne-Vall\u00e9e-Fran\u00e7aise (Loz\u00e8re), where the German maquis destroyed a patrol of the Feldgendarmerie and in an ambush against the Waffen SS on 5 June 1944 at La Rivi\u00e8re. He was leading a small group of about 10 maquisards when the maquis dispersed to evade an attempted encirclement by the SS reacting to these maquis operations. When the various elements of the German maquis reformed at the Plan de Fontmort, a high place of resistance of the Camisards, K\u00fchne took command. He worked with the French \"Bir Hakeim\", although this was not without conflict. The GMR and the milice were tracking them in the mountains. The Wehrmacht attacked the \"Bir Hakeim\" group at La Borie-La Parade on Pentecost Sunday. The fighting left 61 dead; those maquisards who surrendered were executed. K\u00fchne's group lost about ten men.\nHe also fought in the battles for French liberation, welcoming deserters from the Wehrmacht (particularly Armenians) in the Mende region. At that time, he connected with the FTP-MOI. His resistance name became \"Robert\", and he was given military responsibility within FTP-MOI for the Loz\u00e8re, the Gard and the Ard\u00e8che. In June 1944, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and decorated with the Croix de Guerre with a bronze star. By the next month, he had more than 2,000 FTP fighters under his command.\nK\u00fchne seems not to have participated in the liberation of N\u00eemes in person, or in the parade of 4 September (unlike other German anti-fascists). He quickly returned to Lyon, where he participated in the \"Free Germany Committee\" (CALPO).\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nEvelyne et Yvan Br\u00e8s, Un maquis d'antifascistes allemands en France (1942-1944), Les Presses du Languedoc - Max Chaleil \u00e9diteur, 1987 ISBN 2-85998-038-5 (French)",

The office buildings house the individual offices of each U.S. Representative and Senator as well as committee hearing rooms, staff rooms, multiple cafeterias, and areas for support, committee, and maintenance staff.\nThe congressional office buildings are connected to the Capitol by means of underground pedestrian tunnels, some of which are equipped with small railcars shuttling users to and from the Capitol, which together form the Capitol subway system. Congressional pages are responsible for carrying packages and messages from the two chambers to the buildings.\nThe three Senate office buildings are along Constitution Avenue north of the Capitol:\nRussell Senate Office Building (RSOB, completed 1908)\nDirksen Senate Office Building (DSOB, completed 1958)\nHart Senate Office Building (HSOB, completed 1982)\nThe three House office buildings are along Independence Avenue south of the Capitol:\nCannon House Office Building (CHOB, completed 1908)\nLongworth House Office Building (LHOB, completed 1933)\nRayburn House Office Building (RHOB, completed 1965)\nA fourth building, the Ford House Office Building, which used to house the FBI's fingerprint records, sits a few blocks southwest of the others. A fifth building, the O'Neill House Office Building (previously known as \"House Annex-1\") was named after former Speaker of the House Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill. It was demolished in 2002.\nThe U.S. Capitol Complex also includes a Page Residence Hall and the Capitol Power Plant, both on the House side of the Capitol.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHouse Office Building Commission",

At the time of the shooting, Lai was under the influence of a purified form of methamphetamine known as \"ice\".\nO'Donnell died of a single gunshot wound to the head. During the trial, Lai told the Victorian Supreme Court in 2015 that the killing of O'Donnell was an \"accident\" and \"didn't know there was one [bullet] in it\" when referring to the gun. During the 14-month relationship, Lai allegedly beat and punched O'Donnell and made threats, including a text message reading \"I'll kill you, rat\". The jury found Lai guilty of manslaughter over the 22-year-old's death.\nSince the death, O'Donnell's family has made a Change.org petition to create an Australian law called \"Rekiah's Law\".\n\n\n== References ==",
