Provo was born in North Preston, Nova Scotia (one of Canada's largest Black communities) and attended university at Saint Mary's University where he played Canadian football and was drafted in 1995 by the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He went on to play professional football in the Canadian Football League for 8 years (as well as a brief stint in the National Football League). Since retiring from football he has taken further university studies and worked as a school administrator. In the 2006 Nova Scotia election, he ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate for the riding of Preston, but finished second to Liberal Keith Colwell. In 2009, he ran again but placed third behind Colwell and New Democrat Janet Sutcliffe. He is a cousin to boxer Kirk Johnson and hockey player Evander Kane.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCanadian Football League stats at statscrew.com\nBiography at Dalhousie University",

            "content": "The Shashe River (or Shashi River) is a major left-bank tributary of the Limpopo River in Zimbabwe. It rises northwest of Francistown, Botswana and flows into the Limpopo River where Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa meet. The confluence is at the site of the Greater Mapungubwe Transfrontier Conservation Area.\n\n\n== Hydrology ==\nThe Shashe River is a highly ephemeral river, with flow generally restricted to a few days of the year. The river contributes 12.2% of the mean annual runoff of the Limpopo Basin.\nMajor tributaries of the Shashe River include the Simukwe, Shashani, Thuli, Tati and Ramokgwebana rivers. The lower Shashe is a sand filled channel, with extensive alluvial aquifers in the river channel and below the alluvial plains. These supply water for a number of irrigation schemes including Sibasa and Shashi.\nMore than two million years ago, the Upper Zambezi River used to flow south through what is now the Makgadikgadi Pan (presently a vast seasonal wetland) to the Shashe River and thence the Limpopo River.\n\n\n== Settlements ==\nThere is a road bridge and a rail bridge south of Francistown. The lower Shashe River forms the border between Botswana and Zimbabwe and is unbridged. However, at Tuli, both sides of the river are in Zimbabwe and there are two legal crossing points. The Shashi runs through the Shashi Irrigation Scheme and the Tuli Block.[citation needed]\n\n\n== Dams ==\nThe Shashe River is dammed near Francistown at Shashe Dam. The original purpose was to supply water to the industrial city of Selebi-Phikwe. In 1982 it was found that groundwater from the local wells in Francistown had high levels of nitrate, and was also inadequate to meet public demand, so the public water supply for that city was changed over to using water from the Shashe Dam. The dam also supplies water to surrounding villages, Phoenix Mine (Tati Nickel Mining Company/Norilsk Nickel) and Mupane Gold Mine (IAMGOLD).\nFurther downstream, the Dikgatlhong Dam impounds the Shashe near the village of Robelela, completed in December 2011. When full it will hold 400,000,000 cubic metres (1.4\u00d71010 cu ft). The next largest dam in Botswana, the Gaborone Dam, has capacity of 141,000,000 cubic metres (5.0\u00d7109 cu ft). A pipeline from the Dikgatlhong Dam will connect to the North-South Carrier (NSC) pipeline at the BPT1 break pressure tank at Moralane. The NSC will take the water south to Gaborone.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeological changes to the course of the Zambezi River\nThuli River\nMchabezi River\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nSources",

            "content": "The \u010cunovo Water Sports Centre is an artificial whitewater slalom course in Slovakia, on an island in the Danube river, 14 km southeast of Bratislava, near the village of \u010cunovo. It is powered by flow diversion from the \u010cunovo dam. Since 1997, it has hosted a full schedule of local, regional, and international competitions, including multiple World Cup races, 2 European Championships and the 2011 World Championships.\n\n\n== Course description ==\nThe Centre has two parallel whitewater channels; the drop is the same for both channels, 6.6 meters (22 feet). The left channel is 356 meters long, with a 1.9% slope of 19 m/km (98 ft/mile) and a streamflow of 7 to 22 m3/s (247 to 777 ft3/s). The right channel is 460 meters long, with a 1.4% slope of 14 m/km (76 ft/mile) and a streamflow of 7 to 12 m3/s (247 to 424 ft3/s). When both channels are watered, the left channel streamflow is 15 m3/s (530 ft3/s) and the right is 7 m3/s (247 ft3/s).\nThe two channels are connected at two crossover points, making a total of five alternative routes from start to finish. From a start in the left channel, there are three ways to run the course; from a right channel start there are two. Any run which ends up in the left channel includes a sheer final drop called \"Niagara.\"\n\nA conveyor-belt boat lift carries paddlers in their boats up to a 225-meter-long return canal on a level with the start pool.\nThe \u010cunovo Water Sports Centre was built in 1996 on an island near the mid-river end of the \u010cunovo dam, a flood control feature of the \u010cunovo to Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dam system. The island is high enough to remain dry during floods. In March 2002 and again the same August, the whitewater course was inundated, but the buildings and most of the island remained above water.\nWhen the Water Sports Centre operates at full capacity, with the two whitewater channels carrying a combined total of 22 m3/s (777 ft3/s), it siphons off between 9% and 4.5% of the river's normal flow of 250 to 600 m3/s (8,830 to 21,200 ft3/s).\n\nFull course operation represents a 4 megawatt sacrifice of electricity production at the Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dam 30 km farther downstream. Although the water flowing through the slalom course represents only 1.4 megawatts of energy, if it stayed in the reservoir until it reached the Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dam, with a higher vertical drop, its energy potential would be greater. This fact makes the course more expensive to operate, in energy terms, than a similar pump-powered facility.\n\n\n== \u010cunovo Dam ==\n\nThe \"Budapest Treaty\" of 1977, between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, was a plan to tame the Danube and increase its navigability with levees, dams, locks, overflow channels, and designated flood plains, and to generate hydroelectricity. The joint project was intended to cover the entire 150 km stretch of the Danube as it forms the border between Slovakia and Hungary, from the upstream, western, end at \u010cunovo, Slovakia, to Nagymaros, Hungary, in the east. Construction started when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, but only on the Slovakian side. In 1989, Hungary had suspended its participation and in 1992 backed out of the 1977 treaty altogether. Slovakia has been in litigation with Hungary ever since.\nIn 1992, Slovakia completed the 30 km section from \u010cunovo to Gab\u010d\u00edkovo, which includes a dam at each end, each dam spanning half the river width, the two dams being connected by a 30-km long levee, all of which combine to impound the 40 km2 \u010cunovo reservoir and force the river into a navigation channel on the left side of the riverbed. The \u010cunovo dam, on river right at the upstream end, is a flood control feature with 27 spillways to send excess water into the bypass channel and flood plain south of the navigation channel. The Gab\u010d\u00edkovo dam, at the downstream end, contains the main navigation locks and the hydropower plant, which began operation in 1996 and now provides electricity equal to 11% of the total Slovakian demand. Its maximum capacity is 720 megawatts at a water discharge rate of 4,000 m3/s (141,000 ft3/s).\nThe two dams and the levee support a two-lane road which is the first Danube river crossing below Bratislava, but vehicles must drive the length of the 30-km levee to complete the crossing. This is the road which provides access to the Water Sports Centre, mid-river at the \u010cunovo end.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nPanorama photograph\nMid-course photo\nAerial photo, top\nAerial photo, bottom\n2006 video\n2008 video",

The Islamic Movement is headed by Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky, a Shia Muslim cleric.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe movement began with a Shia Muslim university activist, Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, who is said to have become so impressed with the 1979 Iranian Revolution that he wanted one at home. Later, Zakzaky went to Iran, ultimately becoming a Shia cleric. At home he became the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria and turned it into a vehicle for proselytizing and gaining followers in the 1990s. As a result of his activities, millions have converted to Shia Islam in a country once with hardly any Shia population.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe movement is said to incorporate both Shia and Sunni Muslims and to hold processions, mainly in Zaria, to raise awareness about itself and to advocate the liberation of the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel.\nThe movement conducts most of its spiritual activities in Husainiyya Baqiyatullah, located in Zaria. According to the Islamic Human Rights Commission, thousands of Muslims from both Sunni and Shia schools of thought are affiliated with it.\nThe movement has been known as a non-violent Islamic movement for decades. The movement has organised peaceful pro-Palestinian demonstrations on an annual basis across Nigeria for over 33 years, primarily in the state of Kaduna. The movement's gatherings have been attacked several times by both Boko Haram and the Nigerian army.\n\n\n=== Husainiyya Baqiyatullah ===\nHusainiyya Baqiyatullah is a complex building in Zaria, Nigeria. It is the headquarters of the Nigerian Islamic Movement and centre of their activities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReligion in Nigeria\nShia in Nigeria\nQasim Umar Sokoto\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nIslamic Movement In Nigeria",

            "content": "Irretrievable (German: Unwiederbringlich, 1892, also known as Beyond Recall and No Way Back ) is one of realist Theodor Fontane's mature German novels. As with some other of Fontane's novels (including Effi Briest), its heroine is believed to be based roughly on a real person whose demise Fontane heard about, and it deals delicately with near taboo (at the time of writing) topics including adultery and suicide.\nThe novel has been translated twice into English. The first by Douglas Parm\u00e9e in 1963 as Beyond Recall, it was re-published in 2011 by New York Review of Books as Irretrievable. In 2010 a new English translation, No Way Back, was published by Angel Classics (London). There also is a German made-for-TV movie (1968, director Falk Harnack).\nAs for translating this haunting novel into English, even deciding on a translation for the title presents many choices in English (irrecoverable, unrecoverable, irretrievable, unrepeatable, beyond recall, past retrieval, beyond retrieval and irreparable, just to name a few). The subtle word-plays and linguistic motifs which add to the power of its German text are challenging to render into English.\n\n\n== Plot introduction ==\nThe novel takes place in the years 1859-1861 in Holstein, five years before the German-Danish War, at a time when Holstein was governed by Denmark.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nCount Helmuth Holk lives with his countess Christine and their two children in a lonely valley. Christine was raised by nuns and is serious and pious, whereas Holk is by nature fun-loving. When Holk is called away to the Copenhagen court of the Danish princess, he becomes fascinated by a young companion of the princess, Ebba von Rosenberg, who flirts violently with him.\nBy contrast, his marriage with Christine begins to seem unbearably dull, and he rashly seeks a divorce from his wife before realizing that Ebba's attentions were not serious.\nA long separation of Holk and Christine ensues, and only after years and great efforts by friends is a reconciliation between husband and wife engineered. Although on the surface all seems well, Christine is haunted by the previous rejection and drowns herself in the sea.\n\n\n== Editions ==\nBeyond Recall, translated by Douglas Parm\u00e9e, published 1963.\nRe-published as Irretrievable by New York Review of Books in 2011 with new Forward.

            "content": "Major General Robert Young,  (5 January 1877 \u2013 25 February 1953) was a dentist, volunteer soldier, World War I brigade commander and professional soldier in the New Zealand Military Forces.\nA British immigrant who came to New Zealand as a child, Young later rose to serve as a General Officer Commanding, New Zealand Military Forces from 1925 to 1931. For service during World War I he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, mentioned in despatches, and was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to receive the French Legion of Honour during the war.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn at Sunderland, England, in 1877 Young came to New Zealand with his parents as a child. The son of Reverend Robert Young, the Vicar of St Mark's in Carterton, he was educated at Nelson College and after further study began practice as a dentist. His history of military service began in 1898 when he joined the New Zealand Volunteer Forces, serving in the Amuri Mounted Rifles (which was subsequently absorbed into the Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry). Following his marriage to Florence Ward in 1899 he settled in Marton and began service with the Royal Rifles, rising to the rank of captain in 1910 before the unit was incorporated into the new 7th (Wellington-West Coast) Regiment in 1911.\n\n\n== World War I ==\nAfter the New Zealand Government declared war on Germany and made the decision to establish a New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for overseas service, the Wellington Infantry Battalion was formed and began concentrating at Awapuni racecourse in Palmerston North from 12 August 1914. Young joined the unit in the Manawatu and was subsequently promoted to major and appointed Officer Commanding the 9th (Hawke's Bay) Company.\nThe Battalion formed part of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier-General Francis Earl Johnston, and Young departed New Zealand on board the troopship Limerick on 15 October 1914. This vessel was one of twelve troop ships of the main body of the NZEF escorted in convoy by Allied warships, which stopped at Hobart, Albany and Colombo before arriving at the Suez Canal on 1 December 1914. The NZEF established a training camp at Zeitoun and Young, under the direction of his Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel William George Malone, began training his 9th (Hawke's Bay) Company troops until the New Zealand Infantry Brigade was called forward to participate in British operations against the Ottomans in the Suez Canal area from January to February 1915. On return from the field the battalion resumed its training, until the newly formed New Zealand and Australian Division departed for the invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula in late April 1915.\n\n\n=== Gallipoli ===\nYoung landed at Anzac Cove with the battalion on 25 April 1915 and soon gained prominence as a strong military leader. His 9th (Hawke\u2019s Bay) Company moved up Walker's Ridge and defended positions at the Nek from continual Ottoman attacks, in what has been described as some of the severest fighting during the first day of the landings. Young helped push back a series of Turkish counter-attacks on 27 April and supported New Zealand attempts to breakout from the Anzac perimeter on 3 May. He was placed in command of the Auckland Battalion after their near destruction at Helles during the fight at the Daisy Patch and promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel. Young led the Aucklanders during the August Offensive when they sustained significant casualties in an assault at the Pinnacle on 7 August in their bid to take Chunuk Bair.\nYoung remained in charge of the depleted Auckland Battalion as they defended positions on Rhododendron Spur throughout September before they were withdrawn to Lemnos to recuperate. After the battalion returned to Gallipoli he handed the unit back to Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Plugge on 20 November, and then took command of the Canterbury Battalion where he was confirmed as a substantive lieutenant colonel. Young was placed in charge of all New Zealand Infantry Brigade rear parties as the New Zealanders withdrew from the Gallipoli Peninsula in the early hours of the morning on 20 December 1915.\n\n\n=== Western Front ===\n\nAfter the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the NZEF had sufficient personnel to expand by two additional infantry brigades. These were the newly arrived 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, which with the original brigade, now designated the 1st Infantry Brigade, formed the New Zealand Division. The division was transferred to the Western Front in May 1916 under the command of Major-General Andrew Hamilton Russell, with Young remaining in charge of what was now designated the 1st Canterbury Battalion. He commanded the battalion as it became acclimatised to warfare on the Western Front at Armenti\u00e8res, and led it during New Zealand participation in the Battle of the Somme in September 1916.\nYoung's capabilities as a commander were recognised when he was placed in temporary command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade from 31 December 1916 to 6 January 1917 and then subsequently attached to Divisional Headquarters for liaison work during the Battle for Messines in June 1917. He took temporary command of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade in the rank of temporary colonel on 7 August 1917 when Brigadier-General Francis Earl Johnston was killed in action, but his time as a brigade commander was short lived when he was shot in the neck just two days later and evacuated to London.\n\nAfter recuperating in England, Young returned to the Western Front on 4 December 1917 and assumed command of the 1st Infantry Brigade with the rank of temporary Brigadier-General. He was subsequently shifted to command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade on 19 February 1918, and led it during the German Spring Offensive which began in March 1918. He retained command of the brigade for the remainder of the war and saw further action at the Battle of Bapaume and in the push to the Hindenburg Line which contributed to German capitulation in November 1918.\n\n\n=== Armistice ===\nYoung led his brigade into Germany after the cessation of hostilities, where they undertook garrison duties as part of the Allied army of occupation. Then as the NZEF began to draw down he was posted to Sling Camp in England on 10 April 1919, in command of a group of soldiers awaiting their return voyage to New Zealand. Unfortunately, delays in obtaining transports for the return home resulted in considerable impatience and culminated in a camp riot. Young, who was held in great respect by the New Zealand soldiers, was called on to sort the matter out and his arrangements to ensure that married men were returned before single men helped alleviate the situation.\nYoung had the honour of leading New Zealand forces in the victory parade through London in May 1919, before leaving England on 11 July 1919 for demobilisation. On arrival in New Zealand, Young was discharged from the NZEF on 21 October 1919, but chose to continue service with the Permanent Staff of the New Zealand Military Forces.\n\n\n== Interwar period ==\nAfter his return to New Zealand, Young was appointed Honorary Aide de Camp to the Governor General in 1920 and served as Commander of the Canterbury Military District until 1921. He then served as Commander of the Southern Military District until 7 December 1925 when he was promoted to major-general and appointed General Officer Commanding, New Zealand Military Forces. In this role Young was now the head of the army in which he had served since 1898, and key advisor on New Zealand military and defence issues to the New Zealand Government. He remained in this senior role until March 1931 when he retired, moving with his wife to Pohangia to assist their son on his sheep and cattle farm, before finally settling in Otaki.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nOn the commencement of hostilities in August 1940 Young was appointed Dominion Commander of the Home Guard, and a year later Director-General of the Home Guard in the rank of brigadier, based in Wellington. His task was to prepare and supervise a system of training sufficiently disciplined and thorough to create an \"additional line of national defence of real potential value, and to hold the allegiance of men who have no spare time to give to mere paradings\". The Home Guard's role was to limit the area of exploitation of any enemy invasion through the blocking of roads, demolitions, improvisation, and any other means of checking the invader. With the drain on skilled military instructors for the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force, Young had to draw on the expertise of veteran officers and NCOs from World War I. He held this role until 1944 when the threat to New Zealand had sufficiently reduced to allow demobilisation of the Home Guard.\n\n\n== Post-war ==\nYoung returned to Otaki after the war and became engaged in local affairs. He was elected to the Otaki Borough Council in 1945, was Horowhenua Power Board's Otaki representative and became a prominent member of the Otaki Bowling Club. He died in Otaki on 27 February 1953 at the age of 76. A well attended service was initially held in Otaki, before his coffin was taken by hearse to Thorndon, Wellington, where it was transferred to a gun-carriage and draped with the New Zealand flag in a funeral with full military honours. His ashes were subsequently interred at the Marton cemetery.\n\n\n== Awards and decorations ==\nIn recognition of his outstanding bravery and leadership Young was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 8 November 1915 for distinguished service in the field on Gallipoli. For his service as commanding officer of the Auckland Battalion on Gallipoli, Young was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, and later, for his leadership and gallant conduct as a brigade commander, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Young was also Mentioned in Dispatches five times in recognition of his excellent service and appointed a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur by the President of France in February 1916. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders with fewer than 100 awards made, and Young was one of only 14 members of the NZEF to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the War.\n\n\n=== Ribbons ===\n\n Companion of the Order of the Bath (Great Britain)\n Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (Great Britain)\n Distinguished Service Order (Great Britain)\n 1914\u201315 Star (Great Britain)\n British War Medal 1914\u201319 (Great Britain)\n Victory Medal with Mention in Despatches (five times) (Great Britain)\n War Medal 1939-45 (Great Britain)\n New Zealand War Service Medal (New Zealand)\n New Zealand Long and Efficient Service Medal (New Zealand)\n New Zealand Territorial Service Medal (New Zealand)\n Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur (France)\n\n\n== See also ==\nMilitary history of New Zealand in World War I\nList of foreign recipients of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur\n\n\n== End notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Auckland War Memorial Museum Cenotaph, Robert Young\". \n\"Marly's Cottage History\". \n\"Official History of the Wellington Regiment (NZEF) 1914\u20131919\". \n\"Official History of the Auckland Regiment\". \n\"Official History of the Canterbury Regiment, N.Z.E.F. 1914\u20131919\". \n\"Official History of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade\".",

A sequel to the 1999 Sci Fi Channel telefilm Interceptor Force, it is directed by Phillip Roth, and stars Olivier Gruner, Roger R. Cross, Adrienne Wilkinson, Elizabeth Gracen and Nigel Bennett. Government-trained soldiers called the Interceptors are assigned to look at a crash site of an alien spacecraft in Russia where they find a 7-foot-tall (2.1 m) alien that can change shape.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nOver Grozny, Russia, a pair of fighter jets chase down an unidentified spacecraft moving at supersonic speeds. Within minutes, it is the jets that are chased and eventually blasted out of the sky by the spacecraft. Minutes later, residents report a \"meteor\" flying past the city and landing somewhere in the distant hills. Jack Weber, head of the Alpha Force, calls in Lieutenant Sean Lambert, the sole survivor of the first Alpha mission four years ago in Mexico. Lambert's entire team was killed while trying to capture a single specimen of extraterrestrial life. Now Weber wants Lambert to take a new team of interceptors into Russia to capture this new alien specimen.\nLambert and the Alpha Force fly to Grozny. The new team consists of science officer Dawn DeSilva and Special Ops soldiers Bjorn Hatch, Nathan McAllister and Adriana Sikes. They find the wreckage of the alien spacecraft outside a Russian nuclear plant. Holes blasted in the razor fencing and thick concrete walls suggest the alien is inside.\nThe Alpha Force enters the nuclear plant and seal off the exits, creating a trap for the alien. But then, one by one, the team is killed off by a creature that possesses a laser weapon, can change its appearance, and can also regenerate itself completely from a single piece of alien tissue. Additionally, the alien has found a way to explode all the uranium fuel rods in the nuclear plant to create a lethal radiation cloud over Europe that will quickly spread and cover the rest of the world. Lambert and the remaining Alpha Force have 60 minutes to save themselves, and the Earth, from nuclear doom.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nSource\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe film was produced by the Unified Film Organization and Interforce Productions, LLC, in association with Media Entertainment GmbH, Co. 1 Filmproduktions HG and Sci Fi Pictures. Aside from the crewmembers listed in the infobox, the crew includes production designer Kes Bonnet, digital effects supervisor David Ridlen, visual effects supervisor Alvaro Villagomez, and costume designer Irene Sinclair.\nThe original Interceptor Force (1999) had been the Sci Fi Channel's highest-rated TV-movie to that point.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInterceptor Force 2 on IMDb\nInterceptor Force 2 at the TCM Movie Database\nInterceptor Force 2 at AllMovie",

            "content": "For the Italian film, see Super Fuzz.\nThe Univox Super-Fuzz was a fuzzbox produced by the defunct Univox company, primarily for use with the electric guitar or bass. Vintage Super-Fuzz pedals have become highly sought after, and have developed a loyal following.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe circuit was designed in the late 1960s by the Japanese company Shin-ei, (who also produced another well known fuzz box, the Shin-ei Companion FY-2) and manufactured in Japan by Unicord. The first Super-Fuzzes were made in 1968, and production continued until the late 70s.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nThe first units were made in a simple stamped sheet metal box, painted grey, with a blue Univox sticker on the top. Around 1970 production was changed to a die-cast metal box, with a large pedal featuring a rubber cover that had the words \"Super-Fuzz\" embossed on it. The first die cast units were either grey or black, with a green or black foot pedal. Around 1973 or so, they were all produced with an orange pedal, with a green or blue foot pedal. The later models also featured an internal trim pot for controlling the octave balance.\n\n\n=== Alternative manufacturers ===\nAlthough the Univox is the most well known incarnation of this circuit, Shin-ei licensed this circuit out to dozens of manufacturers, including Ibanez, Apollo, Companion, Shaftesbury, Mica, JAX, Kent, Teisco, Marlboro, Memphis, Bruno, Boomer, Alex, Ace Tone, Aria, Avora, Crestwood, Crown, Diamond, Elk, Electra, Excetro, Goya, Hohner, Honey, Kimbara, LRE, Lord, Luxor, Mana, Maya, Mayfair, Mica, National, Northland, Oscar, Pax, Rands, Sekova, Selmer, Tele-Star, Tempo, Thomas, Zenta, Royal, and many others. With a slightly altered input stage, the circuit is identical to the Ibanez Standard Fuzz. Sometimes it was packaged with a wah pedal, or with the tone switch being a footswitch, or both. This circuit is also very similar to the famous Fender Blender and Roland Bee Baa. More recent applications of this circuit type can be found in CBC Pedal's SuperFuzz, Guyatone's TZ-2 Fuzz, MJM China Fuzz, Black Candy Superfuzz Deluxe, Prescription Electronics' OUTBOX, BOSS's FZ-2 HYPER Fuzz, and others, although most tend to agree the newer versions do not sound quite the same.\n\n\n== Sound ==\nThis unique fuzz tone is an octave fuzz using two germanium diodes to produce the square wave clipping. The controls are 'Balance' (volume), 'Expander' (fuzz amount), a two position 'tone' switch, and an on/off footswitch on top. There are two unique features of this device that set it apart from other distortion and fuzz pedals. The first is that the full-wave rectification of the circuit produces an upper octave as well as a slight lower octave. This also gives the sound a lot of compression and gives a mild ring modulator effect. The second unique feature is a tone switch that engages a 1kHz filter that \"scoops\" the mids, giving a very fat, almost bassy tone, unique to this circuit.\nToday there are many remakes available, even some that have the classic look and sound of the original, like the Wattson FY-6.\n\n\n== Super-Fuzz users ==\nNotable musicians who have used the Super-Fuzz include:\nAdam Yauch of Beastie Boys\nBilly Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins (Although he was much more famous for using the Fender Blender and the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff)\nBilly Cox of Jimi Hendrix\nChris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie\nDan Auerbach of The Black Keys uses the Ibanez Standard Fuzz, a nearly identical circuit in an altered housing.\nElliott Frazier of Ringo Deathstarr\nGary Louris of The Jayhawks\nHillel Slovak of Red Hot Chili Peppers\nJ Mascis of Dinosaur Jr.\nJoe Denardo of Growing\nJoe Preston of Thrones\nJosh Homme of Them Crooked Vultures, Queens of the Stone Age and Kyuss\nJon Niederbrach of The Untold Fables\nJus Oborn of Electric Wizard\nKurt Cobain of Nirvana (Stolen in 1989 during the Bleach recording sessions. He mainly used the BOSS DS-1 and DS-2 afterward.)\nMark Arm and Steve Turner of Mudhoney\nPete Townshend of The Who\nPoison Ivy of The Cramps\nScott Hill of Fu Manchu\nTony McPhee of The Groundhogs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEffects Database page on the Super-Fuzz",

            "content": "Henry or Henri Berger (August 4, 1844, Berlin \u2013 October 14, 1929, Honolulu) was a Prussian Kapellmeister composer and royal bandmaster of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi from 1872 to 1915.\nBerger was born 'Heinrich August Wilhelm Berger in Prussia and became a member of Germany's imperial army band. He worked under the composer and royal bandmaster of Germany, Johann Strauss, Jr. Originally, Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany loaned Berger from his Potsdam station to King Kamehameha V to conduct the king's band. He arrived in Honolulu in June 1872, fresh from service in the Franco-Prussian War. In 1877, King Kal\u0101kaua appointed Berger to full leadership of the Royal Hawaiian Band. In 1879, he became a naturalized citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\nBerger befriended the future Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani, a composer in her own right. Berger arranged the songs she wrote, performed by the brass band. The queen named Berger the \"Father of Hawaiian Music\". From 1893 to 1903, the bandmaster worked with the Kamehameha Schools to develop its music program. He also built what is today the Honolulu Symphony.\nHe led the government band at thousands of public events. Among these were \"steamer day,\" when a ship left the Honolulu docks. The band serenaded the departees with \"Auld Lang Syne,\" or \"The Girl I Left Behind Me.\"\nLater in his tenure as royal bandmaster, Berger took it upon himself to record traditional Hawaiian hymns, chants and other Hawaiian music in print to ensure their survival, a task never done before. Berger at the same time composed the classics: \"The Hula March\", \"Hilo March\", \"Kohala March\" and \"Sweet Lei Lehua.\" His arrangement of \"Hawai\u02bbi Pono\u02bb\u012b\", with text by Kal\u0101kaua in honor of Kamehameha became the national anthem. Today, the song serves as the state anthem.\nBerger combined German, Austrian and Hawaiian traditions in his unique compositions and performed with the Royal Hawaiian Band thousands of times, making Hawaiian music known and popular in many countries. Berger started the RHB 'Aloha\" welcome and farewell greetings at the harbors\nHis resting-place is the Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church Cemetery in Honolulu.\nRobert Louis Stevenson mentioned Berger in his novel The Bottle Imp.\nBerger's legacy continues today, celebrated worldwide especially in Hawaii and Germany, as the father of the Royal Hawaiian Band, the oldest municipal band in the United States.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Literature ==\nPatrick D.

            "content": "The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) is a species of honeyeater in a monotypic genus.\n\n\n== Description ==\nWeighing around 20-25g, the painted honeyeater is a small bird that is approximately 16 cm in length, with a wingspan of a similar length. Of the total length, the tail averages about 5.5 cm long and the bill 1.3 cm.\nThe face, crown and upper parts of the body (including the scapulars, nape and rump) on adult male birds are black, with small white spots located on either side of the head. The underside of the body, consisting of the chin, throat, breast and belly, as well as the underside of the tail, is white. Black spots may be present in amongst the white feathers of the flanks, breast and belly.\nThe edges of black flight feathers and greater primary and secondary coverts are bright yellow, as are those of the tail feathers, which also have white tips. The striking colour contrast in the feathers of the remiges and retrices is one of the species' most distinctive traits, along with its pink bill, which has a grey tip. Feet and legs are also grey, while the irises of the eyes are reddish-brown .\nFemales are slightly smaller than the males and are paler in colour, with fewer spots running down the flanks. Juveniles are even paler than the female, appearing more brown than black, with fainter yellow colouring to feathers and with a grey bill rather than the pink seen on adults.\n\n\n== Vocalisation ==\n\nCommonly known to give the call \u201cGeorgie\u201d, which is broken into two notes, for example geor-gie or georg-EEE. This can also be done in reverse. Males can be particularly vocal during courtship and both sexes are known to call when in flight during the breeding season as they leave and approach the nest.\nSome birds may quieten down once nesting has begun or give softer calls as they are approached by people, or when they are settling down on the nest. A call sounding like \u201cchur\u201d, has been recorded and associated with movement into and out of the nest, possibly signalling relief at returning to the nest.\nUnder the threat of predation they also give out alarm calls, both males and females using differing intensity calls depending on the situation, a more urgent call being sounded when eggs are being stolen.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nA member of the Meliphagidae family, Grantiella picta is the sole species under this genus. The painted honeyeater was first described in 1838 by Gould and given the name Entomophila picta, but it was renamed Grantiella picta in 1911 by Mathews.\nIt took another sixty years from its initial description before details of its eggs, habits, and distribution began to be investigated and recorded. Its genus name is in reference to Robert Grant, a Scottish born taxidermist and collector, while the species name originates from the Latin word for painted, pictus, and refers to the yellow markings on the feathers of its tail and wings.\nDNA sequencing has helped in separating genera within the Meliphagidae family into four main clades which show relationships between species, though a shortage in sampling and statistics has led to some branches within the clades being more strongly linked than others.\nA study conducted by Driskell and Christdis  suggested that Grantiella is in the fourth clade and has associations with Plectorhyncha and Xanthotis. The relationship reported between Grantiella and Plectorhyncha was an unexpected discovery due to their morphological differences; their similarities in nest building behaviour previously not enough to believe the two species may be closely linked.\nSeveral findings in the study by Driskell and Christdis  have since been questioned in a more recent study on the DNA within the Meliphagidae family, but Grantiella picta was not one of the species investigated further.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nIts core range is inland south-eastern Australia where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests.\nThe painted honeyeater is endemic to Australia and can be found across eastern and northern parts of the country. Over spring and summer its distribution stretches from inland central Victoria through scattered parts of much of New South Wales and the ACT and into southern Queensland.\nOver winter birds migrate to north Queensland, around Cape York Peninsula, and eastern areas of the Northern Territory. There have also been recordings of several sightings in far eastern parts of South Australia.\nFound predominantly in woodlands and forests which contain Eucalyptus and Acacia species their movement is not completely understood but has been connected to the presence of mistletoe and the role of that plant as a food source. Their migration south-north is believed to be as a result of mistletoe berry availability at certain times of the year.\nStudies have been conducted which suggest that habitat areas which have undergone less fragmentation and land clearing may see a greater number of painted honeyeaters present. They have also been found to be more abundant in locations where there are a large number of trees present and a high percentage of canopy cover.\nThe painted honeyeater is a nomadic species that is very elusive. Observing them is rare but when they are seen it is commonly as pairs or individuals, and less frequently as a flock.\n\n\n=== Important Bird Areas ===\nBirdLife International has identified the following sites as being important for painted honeyeater conservation:\nNew South Wales\nBinya and Cocoparra\nCapertee Valley\nGoonoo\nPilliga\nSouth-west Slopes of NSW\nQueensland\nBoodjamulla\nVictoria\nWarby-Chiltern Box-Ironbark Region\n\n\n== Life History ==\n\n\n=== Breeding ===\n\nWhile the breeding patterns of some species of honeyeaters, such as the Regent honeyeater, are based around the nectar of a particular flowering tree  those of the painted honeyeater appear to be centred on the presence of mistletoe berries, particularly those in the genus Amyema.\nAlthough painted honeyeaters build nests in a variety of tree species including Eucalyptus spp. many also favour yarran (Acacia homalophylla) and white cyprus pine (Callitris glaucophylla), both of which are hosts of the hemiparasitic grey mistletoe (Amyema quandang).\nThe breeding season typically takes place from October through to March, the exact timing determined by the availability of resources, which can in turn be influenced by environmental conditions. Successful reproduction hinges on the availability of food; both the adult and young are dependent on adequate resources for survival.\nMale painted honeyeaters generally arrive at the nesting site several weeks before the female, with both sexes leaving around the same time about 5 months later when mistletoe berry numbers begin to decline. Although the fruit is available all year, it is more plentiful over the warmer months, and dwindles as the temperature drops.\nUsing environmental cues, the timing of nesting is determined by the painted honeyeaters so they are not arriving at sites as food resources are declining rather than beginning to increase. Coinciding breeding with fruit ripening may also correlate with the preference of many individuals to nest near or amongst mistletoe.\nIt is believed the closeness of the fruit to the nesting sites allows the species to put more effort into other activities as a result of not having to go searching for food. However, it has been shown that nests situated within the mistletoe clump can cause higher rates of nest failure and predation, possibly as the result of opportunistic behaviour by other bird species, such as the Spiny-cheeked honeyeater.\nThe fact that this species builds nests at locations where the required resources are readily available has a direct influence on which habitats are chosen. The branching of mistletoes provides structure for the nest to be built in, and the dense foliage helps with concealment. Selecting mistletoe as a site for a nest may also offer a favourable microclimate, one that possibly provides a cooler environment during warmer periods.\n\nThe life stages from the initiation of a clutch, through to hatching and fledging are a direct response to the availability of the berries as a food source, with fledging occurring just before berry ripening has reached its peak.\nWhile the role of the male in nest construction is limited in some species of honeyeaters, this is not the case with the painted honeyeater. Both male and female painted honeyeaters build and shape the nest, weaving and modifying it in a process that can take weeks. While the female builds, the male sits at the top of the tree, following the female when she leaves in search of nest material. The male may return sooner to add to the nest, but after departing again he will eventually reappear with the female.\nThe male following the female during nest building is an attempt to guard her from other interested males, but this behaviour is believed to stop once there are eggs in the nest. The incubation and care of young is also carried out by both males and females  with some pairs having more than one attempt at breeding per season \n\n\n=== Nests and eggs ===\n\nNests are cup-shaped and made up of a variety of materials including fine roots, bark and grass. Small twigs, flowers and various fibres have also been recorded as contributing to the construction of painted honeyeater nests. Spider web is used to weave the structure together to form a thin nest, which may be see-through in places.\nHeight of nests in trees can vary from a couple of metres off the ground to over 15 metres high. They are usually built either in the drooping foliage of a eucalypt or other nesting tree species, or they are made within the structure of a mistletoe plant.\nThe clutch typically consists of 2 eggs, but may be either 1 or 3. They are oval, with one end of the egg bigger than the other, and are approximately 2 cm long. Pale pink in colour they are marked all over with red-brown spots which become more prominent towards the larger end of the egg.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\nMost honeyeaters have a mixed diet, consuming nectar, berries and insects from a range of sources and locations. The painted honeyeater is a frugivore, a dietary specialist dependent on the presence of mistletoe plants and its fruit; and the abundance of this species can usually be determined by this food source.\nAt least 5 species of Amyema have been documented as being a food source for the painted honeyeater, for which the birds then assist in dispersal of the mistletoe by excreting the seed. Berries which grow on the grey mistletoe (Amyema quandang) are sources of carbohydrates, protein and water, and account for a significant amount of their diet.\nIn addition to mistletoe berries, painted honeyeaters consume nectar and insects when berries are unavailable. They may also need insects and nectar to account for a low intake of certain nutrients from the berries. Mistletoe fruit is known to be low in amino acids and protein, so painted honeyeaters must rely on these other food sources to make up the remainder of their dietary requirements.\n\n\n== Status and conservation (Threats) ==\nPainted honeyeaters are threatened by habitat loss. Listed as vulnerable in several states and territories in Australia, fragmentation and land clearing of areas which provide habitat for the painted honeyeater pose serious threats to the survival of this species.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nPainted honeyeaters are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.\n\n\n=== Victoria ===\nThe painted honeyeater is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988). Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared.\nOn the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the painted honeyeater is listed as vulnerable.\n\n\n=== New South Wales ===\nListed as vulnerable under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.\n\n\n=== Australian Capital Territory ===\nListed as vulnerable under The Nature Conservation Act 1980.\n\n\n=== Queensland ===\nListed as vulnerable under the Nature Conservation Act 1992.\n\n\n=== Northern Territory ===\nListed as vulnerable under the Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000.\nThe management of fragmented landscapes with a high concentration of mistletoe is vitally important in the conservation of the painted honeyeater, as their breeding success is affected by its abundance. Perceived as a pest in many regards, the mistletoe living within vegetation remnants plays an important role in helping to maintain both species populations and biodiversity. The density of mistletoe has been found to influence species richness, with endangered and declining species benefiting from the food resources this plant has to offer.\nEffective maintenance of mistletoe is needed in relation to the management of host species and agricultural practices which influence their abundance, and as a result the habitats of the painted honeyeater. Studies conducted suggest that remnants, such as the Acacia harpophylla remnants located in south Queensland, are important to the painted honeyeater as habitat destruction continues across its distribution range.\nThe conservation and management of habitats which aim to protect the survival of species such as the regent honeyeater (Xanthomyza phrygia) and swift parrot (Lathamus discolor) may also aid in the conservation of the painted honeyeater. For this reason, consideration must be given to the direct influence mistletoe has in sustaining and providing for species populations, and in the conservation of these species.\n\n\n== References ==",

The Fall on Deaf Ears played in the post-hardcore style typical of bands such as The Nation of Ulysses and Circus Lupus. They played live shows with bands such as Propagandhi, Egon and Select Your Fighter. The act only recorded a handful of songs before bassist Laura Beard and guitarist Sarah Reiser were killed in a car wreck in 1997. They were both 17 years old.\nCedric Bixler-Zavala would later write the song \"Napoleon Solo\" as singer/lyricist with At The Drive-in about the tragedy. In the 5 recorded tracks, samples of Miles Davis' \"Bitches Brew\" can be heard.\nZavala moved on to At the Drive-In from The Fall on Deaf Ears and later to The Mars Volta.\n\n\n== Members ==\nSarah Reiser - Vocals, Guitar\nLaura Beard - Vocals, Bass\nCedric Bixler-Zavala - Drums, Vocals\nClint Newsom - Guitar, Vocals, Recording\n\n\n== Discography ==\nThe Fall on Deaf Ears EP\n1.

            "content": "Turok is a first-person shooter video game developed by Propaganda Games, and published by Disney Interactive Studios under the Touchstone Games label for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in February 2008. It was ported on to Microsoft Windows in April 2008.\nThe game is loosely based on the comic book series of the same title and is unrelated to the story and setting of previous Turok video games. Players assume the role of Native American space marine Joseph Turok, who is part of a team sent to a remote planet to apprehend his previous commanding officer, General Roland Kane, who is now a wanted war criminal. After crash landing, Turok discovers that the planet is home to all manner of dinosaurs, and must fight both the predatory creatures and Kane's private army on his mission to take down his former mentor.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe gameplay of Turok is similar to that of most first-person shooters, with a strong focus on survival in dangerous natural environments. The human enemies, under the leadership of Kane, are the main threat to the player, although dinosaurs may often be found wandering throughout the game. The dinosaurs act as a neutral force and, if the player chooses, can be used as a tool to attack enemy soldiers. This may be done by attracting roaming dinosaurs to a firefight (via: flares, gunshots, etc.) to aid the player and help dispatch the enemy, with possible other ways depending on the situation. The dinosaurs' intelligence are much alike the Earth dinosaurs, so other dinosaurs and all humans, including the player's allies and enemies, may be attacked. The game does not utilize an aim-assist feature.\nThe developer Propaganda Games has included an additional, stealth mechanic in the game. Because Turok takes place mostly in jungle environments with a focus on ambiance, the player may kill enemies with a bow or knife without being heard or use dinosaurs to attract the attention of other enemies and slip by unnoticed. A famed new feature into this game is the Silent Kill, which is done by drawing the knife, then attacking a human or unaware dinosaur from behind. The kill can be utilized against dinosaurs and humans alike as a finishing blow, and can be executed from any side. The knife is also utilized as a self-defense weapon during phases known as \"mauls\", where the player is attacked by a dinosaur or bug, and must hammer on the according buttons in order to counter-attack or fend off the attack.\n\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nOnline multiplayer support is also available. There is a (Team) Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Wargames, and Assault Capture the Flag. Multiplayer supports up to 16 people, and 4 players for three co-op missions. A feature in the multiplayer\u2014randomly spawning computer-controlled dinosaurs and insects that appear in various locations in levels\u2014adds a new factor to the gameplay. While players must worry about the opposing enemies, they must now also worry about the hostile dinosaurs that will be attempting to kill them. There can be up to 4 A.I controlled dinosaurs or insects on any map at one time. Unfortunately, splitscreen multiplayer is not supported in any form.\nOriginally, the Xbox 360 version of Turok was set to feature an Achievement called \"Grab Bag\", which required players to kill at least one enemy, one dinosaur, one teammate, and themselves, all in the same match. This caused controversy on the Internet as the Achievement essentially rewarded players for team killing. Josh Holmes, a representative of Propaganda Games, described the creation of the Achievement by saying \"What we found was that players playing their first match in Turok \u2013 almost every player \u2013 was (accidentally) killing himself, a team mate and an enemy with a grenade or a Stick [sic] Bomb gun and so we thought 'hey, we should give them an Achievement for that', as kind of a joke.\" He went on to say that developers were planning to release a patch removing Grab Bag if excessive team killing became a problem after launch. In the launch version of the game, however, while the \"Grab Bag\" Achievement is still present, it removed the requirement of killing a teammate, and is awarded after the player kills an enemy, a dinosaur, and themselves in the same match. A Map pack called the \"Velociraptor Pack\" was later released, containing two new multiplayer maps, one new Co-op map, and 2 refurbished maps, which now take place at night.\nThe online multiplayer for the PlayStation 3 version has been permanently shutdown since February 2011.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe player controls Corporal Joseph Turok, former member of the Wolf Pack, a specialized military detachment whose members were trained in black ops by General Roland Kane. After a falling out with the group, Turok was reassigned to a general military unit known as Whiskey Company. The team has been assembled to apprehend his former mentor and return him to Earth. After committing various war crimes, Kane had disappeared three years earlier only to surface on a backwater world. Unbeknownst to Whiskey Company, the planet is under the jurisdiction of the Mendel-Grumman (M-G) Corporation, and Kane is in command of a private army of M-G soldiers and equipment.\nAt first, the crew shuns Turok, thinking that he is an inexperienced fighter, untrustworthy, and a liability. One particular member, Slade, has a personal grudge against Turok because his brother Robert was also a member of Wolf Pack, and was killed in the same battle in Colombia from which Turok had reputedly fled, earning him his dubious reputation.\nOn approach to their destination, their starship is shot down from orbit and crash lands on the terraformed surface, where Turok quickly learns that the jungles covering the planet are inhabited by dinosaurs. Despite being genetically engineered, the dinosaurs are wild and dangerous, and the M-G soldiers have been capturing them to be used as experimental weapons for General Kane, meaning a three-way battle between Whiskey Company, the M-G soldiers, and the dinosaurs takes place throughout the game. Upon crashing, many of Whiskey Company are killed by the crash or are either killed by dinosaurs or M-G soldiers.\nUpon seeing where the rest of the ship came down, Turok and a fellow survivor, Sergeant Henderson, attempt to contact members of Whiskey Company, but the latter is ambushed and killed by a Utahraptor. Turok then proceeds to find other Whiskey Company members on his own, following wreckage and bodies. He eventually finds Slade, who is less than pleased to meet Turok. They proceed to get to the main crash site, finding Turok's bow in the process. The pair navigate the jungles, an M-G outpost, a dinosaur-infested valley, and a raptor cave. They eventually link up with Reese, Whiskey Company's resident sniper, and stumble upon a group of M-G troops searching starship wreckage for survivors before heading through a lair of feline-like raptors. The group eventually makes their way to the crash site where they find Chief Engineer Carter, heavy weapons trooper Jericho, weapons specialist Logan, Whiskey Company's medic Parker, second-in-command Lewis, Company leader Cole, technician and pilot Shepard, and soldiers Foster and Gonzales. After resting up, Turok is sent by Cole on a mission to find fellow survivors from the crash. As Turok navigates the forest he comes in contact with John Grimes, Kane's second-in-command, and is threatened by the former Wolf Pack member for \"betraying\" Wolf Pack. Later on, Turok comes across a lone survivor, Cowboy. Turok and Cowboy begin a conversation, but it's cut short when Cowboy is injured by Grimes via an arrow to the stomach. The group arrives to Turok's and Cowboy's aid, with the majority thinking it was Turok who injured Cowboy. Eventually, Cole then tasks Turok, Foster, and Gonzales to find the comm unit from the ship's wreckage to attempt to call for help.\nThe marines shortly come across what looked like an abandoned outpost and Foster, who was on point, is shot by a sniper. Turok and Gonzales assault the outpost, before having to defend said outpost from an M-G counterattack. Moving deeper into the jungle, they finally find more wreckage from the ship. Gonzales finds the comm unit on a rocky ledge, and is subsequently ambushed and carried off by Mama Scarface, a T. Rex who has scars on her right side from battles with M-G soldiers. Turok sets off in pursuit. During the chase, Turok ends up in the nest of the T. Rex and is attacked by her offspring, which he kills. When he locates the comm unit, Mama Scarface herself appears and attacks him. During the battle, she gets her right eye knifed, but she throws Turok off and out of her lair. After regaining consciousness, Turok finds that night has fallen and he now has to make his way back to camp while navigating through an abandoned outpost and fighting raptors along the way.\nReaching the camp, he informs the others that Foster and Gonzales didn't make it. Slade is not happy about the news and claims that Gonzales was his closest friend. Out of anger, Slade challenges Turok to a knife fight and accuses him of being a traitor. Cowboy, having recovered, defends Turok, and Jericho drags a defiant Slade out of the way. After that argument, Turok gives the comm unit to Cowboy and thanks him for his support. Cole, who is about to inform Turok of something, is suddenly killed by an arrow fired from Grimes and a battle ensues at the camp as M-G troops storm the area. Whiskey Company wins the battle, fending off waves of infantry and even a spider tank, but during the battle Parker is gunned down by Chaingun Troopers and Lewis killed off as well. Even worse, the comm unit was destroyed during the fight. A brief clash for leadership occurs until Logan, unofficially, takes command. Jericho then insists that they go hunt down M-G in retaliation for their fellow soldier's deaths but an approaching storm soon changes his mind. Upon hearing a strange noise along with a large light beam in the distance of the forests, Logan orders Turok and Slade to investigate. Knowing that this was a suicide mission, Carter speaks up but is ordered to go with them. The rest of the company then search for a way off of the planet.\nWhen they arrive at their destination, a seemingly derelict outpost, they discover that the light emitted was from an APC that was pulled halfway into the ground. Forcing their way into the outpost, they come across a log entry from Kane, detailing scorpion-like bugs with a potent neurotoxin. Carter, who was on a separate computer, soon finds the location of a shuttle in an abandoned substation not far from the main M-G base. Turok relays this info to Logan, only to be attacked by the bugs, which drag Carter underground. Managing to escape from the swarm, Turok and Slade eventually fall into an underground cave system. Turok then has to navigate the dark caves, fending off bugs before reuniting with Slade at an underground river. Their reunion is cut short as a kraken-like creature emerges from the water and Turok manages to kill it. Slade begrudgingly thanks Turok for saving his life, having now come to respect him. They eventually escape the caves and link up with what's left of Whiskey Company.\nUpon seeing a patrolling convoy coming for their position, Logan accuses Turok of drawing M-G soldiers to them since the beginning, and threatens to shoot him. A battle begins, in which Logan is killed by a gunship and Jericho sacrifices himself to allow the last of Whiskey Company to flee into the substation. The survivors reach the hangar where the ship is located, only to discover that the ship was long destroyed by the environment. With no other choice, they decide to go to the main M-G base. As the five remaining soldiers reach the M-G Base Reese discovers a back entrance,however; he is killed by an arrow to his eye from an unseen Grimes. Slade, Shepard, Cowboy and Turok enter the base, indirectly helped by Mama Scarface, who was rampaging at the base's gate. Inside, they come across another log from Kane, stating that he had developed a nerve gas from the scorpion-bugs' blood, a gas that can kill any living creature before dissipating without a trace. To prevent the bio-weapon from leaving the planet, Turok sets charges on the generators. However, he and the others are captured by Kane. During the ensuing argument between Kane and Turok, Cowboy speaks out, saying none of them would have survived this long without Turok, and Kane kills him. Turok detonates the charges, which results in the death of Grimes.\nTurok, Shepard, and Slade navigate their way through the collapsing base, battling MG soldiers and raptors. Soon they reach the ship but Turok refuses to board it until Kane is dead, proceeding to shoot down his escape craft and engage him in a knife fight, coming out the victor. Immediately after, Turok is confronted by Mama Scarface, driven insane by the loss of her brood. Turok manages to get a grenade in her ruptured eye, which causes the T. Rex's head to explode. Turok is then picked up by Shepard and Slade in their ship, and the three friends finally escape the planet.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nTurok received mostly mixed or average reviews. As of November 2014, the game holds an aggregate score of 69.92% on GameRankings and a 69 out of 100 on Metacritic.\nTurok has received a 9/10 from Play magazine and a 7/10 from both the Official Xbox Magazine and the Official PlayStation Magazine. Both praised multiplayer but commented on the \"sketchy enemy awareness\" and \"dodgy textures\". GameTrailers, which gave the game 8.3/10, highlighted the game's use of the Unreal Engine 3, believing it to be \"the best use of the tech outside of Epic's own efforts\" and praising the modeling and animation of the dinosaurs in particular. 1UP.com gave the game a score of C+, specifically complaining about its stealth mechanics, the use of camera shaking, and occasional graphical glitches in the PlayStation 3 version. Hyper's Yuri Spadeface commended the game for its \"solid frame rate\" but he criticised the \"frustrating level design and average execution\". Turok received 3/5 from X-Play, who commented on its aim-assist being woefully inadequate both in multiplayer and singleplayer, but praised its graphics and \"outlook\".\nTurok was a commercial success, shifting over 1 million units in its first two months of sales. The game was popular enough for Propaganda Games to begin working on a sequel for the Xbox 360 before the Touchstone games division was shuttered.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\nTurok 2, known chronologically as Turok 6 in various news articles, was a planned and partially developed sequel to Turok from 2008. It was eventually cancelled mid-development, due to many layoffs at Propaganda Games and their eventual closure in 2011.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTurok at Curlie (based on DMOZ)\nTurok at MobyGames\nTurok on IMDb",

Its main aim was to provide water to the residents of Vadodara. Although the population of Vadodara at that time was 100,000 it was the ruler's vision to build the reservoir three times larger. This reservoir has the ability to attend to the water requirements of about 300,000 people residing in the eastern parts of the city.\nThe dam is about 5 km long. It can store water to the height of 211 feet above the sea level (its overflow level). The floor of the reservoir is at around 196 feet. It is connected to the Vishwamitri river which flows through the city of Vadodara, so that excess water in event of floods is dispatched to this river. The reservoir has 62 gates.\nThe engineer of the dam was Jagannath Sadashiva Hate, also known as Shri Jagannath Sadashivji. When the reservoir is full, it is supposed to have a catchment area of something close to 195 square kilometers.\nIn 2003 it was reported that the dam had been damaged by rats making holes in it.\nIn 2005 heavy rain led to concerns that the reservoir might flood, threatening Vadodara.\n\n\n== Nature conservation ==\nAdjacent to the dam are the famous Ajwa gardens also called as Vrindavan Garden, which are an adaptation of the famous Vrindavan gardens located in Mysore. It is very famous especially in the evenings for its coloured fountains and a musical fountain.\n\nThe reservoir is home to some 340 crocodiles.\n\n\n== References ==",

Bernazard served as an assistant to Mets general manager Omar Minaya before being dismissed on July 27, 2009.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\nDuring his ten-year major league career, Bernazard played second base, shortstop, and designated hitter for the Montreal Expos, Chicago White Sox, Seattle Mariners, Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, and Detroit Tigers. He hit 75 home runs in 3700 at-bats. His career hitting line (BA/OBP/SLG) stands at .262/.339/.387.\nBernazard missed out on the Chicago White Sox divisional pennant run of 1983 when he was traded to the Mariners for second baseman Julio Cruz on June 15 of that year. The speedier Cruz helped spur the Sox to win the division by 20 games.\nIn 1984 with the Indians, he went through an 0 for 44 stretch at the plate, tying a major league hitless streak for non-pitchers in the last 50 years. He hit only .221 that year. He rebounded to have two productive seasons with the Indians batting .274 in 1985 and a career high .301 in 1986 while also hitting 17 home runs.\nFrom 1988\u20131990, he played for the Nankai / Fukuoka Daiei Hawks in the Japanese Pacific League. After a brief major league comeback in 1991 with the Tigers, in which he went 2-for-12 in six games, his career was over.\n\n\n== Front office career ==\nBernazard became the vice president of development for the New York Mets in December 2004 after serving as a special assistant to general manager Omar Minaya.\nDuring the 2004 off-season, then-free agent first baseman Carlos Delgado was offended when Bernazard\u2014a fellow Puerto Rican\u2014attempted to gain an advantage in wooing Delgado to the Mets by utilizing what Delgado termed \"street Spanish.\" Delgado was heavily critical in public of the Mets negotiating tactics. He reportedly referred to Bernazard as \"the highest-paid translator on the planet\" after meeting him and Minaya for a face-to-face negotiating session at baseball's Winter Meetings. Bernazard, who was known for his flamboyant antics around the Mets offices and Shea Stadium, downplayed the incident.\nBernazard came under scrutiny again during the 2008 season, when it was reported that he was allegedly the person who orchestrated the firing of then Mets manager Willie Randolph. Bernazard came under renewed scrutiny in late July during the 2009 season after removing his shirt and challenging several Binghamton Mets players to fights. The same week Bernazard had another tirade at Citi Field when a Diamondbacks scout occupied a seat that he wanted and one of his deputies suggested to him that he wait until the end of the half inning, prompting Bernazard to become angry. In addition, Bernazard had an angry confrontation with Mets closer Francisco Rodr\u00edguez on the team bus, while returning to the team's hotel after an 11\u20130 loss to the Atlanta Braves.\nThe Mets organization issued a statement by general manager Minaya saying, in part, \"I spoke with Tony [Bernazard] this morning and informed him of my decision to terminate his employment with the Mets\", confirming an earlier report. At the press conference announcing the firing, Minaya angrily challenged the accuracy of past news reports, claiming that New York Daily News reporter Adam Rubin, who initially broke the story about Bernazard challenging Binghamton Mets players to a fight, was angling for a position in the Mets organization. Omar Minaya fired Bernazard from the Mets on Monday July 27, 2009.\n\n\n== Post-Mets career ==\nIn October 2009, Adam Rubin reported in his blog that Bernazard was close to joining the renowned sports agency Boras Corp., led by baseball super agent Scott Boras. Bernazard later denied this in an interview with FOX Sports' Ken Rosenthal. In the interview (dated April 27, 2010), Bernazard claimed that the media reports about his behavior were untrue. He also claimed that the Mets organization did not support him because the team needed a scapegoat for the 2009 season. As far as his career was concerned, Bernazard was not employed by a baseball team at that time, despite the fact that Bernazard claims he \"had some calls\" from unspecified sources at the end of December 2009. He additionally claimed that he \"[hasn't] been looking for a job.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Major League Baseball players from Puerto Rico\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCareer statistics and player information from Baseball-Reference, or Fangraphs, or The Baseball Cube",

            "content": "A hydrogen maser, also known as hydrogen frequency standard, is a specific type of maser that uses the intrinsic properties of the hydrogen atom to serve as a precision frequency reference.\nBoth the proton and electron of a hydrogen atom have spins. The atom has a higher energy if both are spinning in the same direction, and a lower energy if they spin in opposite directions. The amount of energy needed to reverse the spin of the electron is equivalent to a photon at the frequency of 1,420,405,751.786 hertz (Hz), which corresponds to the 21 cm line in hydrogen spectrum.\nHydrogen masers are very complex devices and sell for as much as US$235,000. They are made in two types: active and passive.\nIn both types, a small storage bottle of molecular hydrogen, H2, leaks a controlled amount of gas into a discharge bulb. The molecules are dissociated in the discharge bulb into individual hydrogen atoms by an arc. This atomic hydrogen passes through a collimator and a magnetic state selector. The atoms are thereby selected for the desired state and passed on to a storage bulb. The storage bulb is roughly 20 cm high and 10 cm in diameter and made of quartz. Its inside is coated with Teflon, allowing many collisions of the atoms with the wall without perturbation of the atomic state, and slowing the recombination of the hydrogen atoms into hydrogen molecules. A durable Teflon & bulb coating technology allows for over 20-year lifetime. The storage bulb is in turn inside a microwave cavity made from a precisely machined copper or silver-plated ceramic cylinder. This cavity is tuned to the 1.420 GHz resonance frequency of the atoms. A weak static magnetic field is applied parallel to the cavity axis by a solenoid to lift the degeneracy of the magnetic Zeeman sublevels. To decrease the influence of changing external magnetic fields on the transition line frequency and be compliant to electromagnetic interferences, the cavity is surrounded by several nested layers of shields.\nIn the active hydrogen maser, the cavity oscillates by itself. This requires a higher hydrogen atom density and a higher quality factor for the cavity. However, with advanced microwave cavities made out of silver-plated ceramic, the gain factor can be much higher, thereby requiring less hydrogen atom density. The active maser is more complex and more expensive but has better short-term and long-term frequency stabilities.\nIn the passive hydrogen maser, the cavity is fed from an external 1.420 GHz frequency. The external frequency is tuned to produce a maximum output in the cavity. This allows the use of lower hydrogen atom density and lower cavity quality factor, which reduces the cost.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTimeline of hydrogen technologies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBauch, A.

            ], 
            "content": "Wayward Pines is an American mystery, science fiction television series based on the Wayward Pines novels by Blake Crouch. Developed for television by Chad Hodge, the pilot was directed by M. Night Shyamalan, with both as executive producers. The series premiered May 14, 2015 on Fox. On December 9, 2015, Fox renewed the series for a second season which premiered on May 25, 2016.\nBelow is a list of characters central to the series.\n\n\n== Main cast ==\n\n\n=== Ethan Burke ===\nEthan Burke (Matt Dillon) is a U.S. Secret Service agent and the main protagonist of season 1. In the pilot episode, he is dispatched by Adam Hassler, his supervisor, to locate Agent Kate Hewson (with whom Ethan also had an extramarital affair) and another agent named Stallings. Hewson and Stallings had themselves been sent to Wayward Pines to find a missing agent named Evans, and had never reported back to Hassler. After awaking in Wayward Pines, Ethan is reunited with his family, but learns they cannot escape the town. He runs afoul of strict Sheriff Arnold Pope, ultimately killing him in self defense, and is then appointed Sheriff himself by David Pilcher. Pilcher reveals the truth about Wayward Pines to Ethan, who agrees to help Pilcher keep order, but only if he can do things his own way. During an Abbie attack in the final episode of season 1, Ethan sacrifices himself to save what's left of humanity.\n\n\n=== Kate Hewson ===\nKate Hewson (Carla Gugino) is Ethan's former lover and one of the missing agents he is initially trying to find in season 1. When Ethan does locate her in town, she is noticeably older, which confuses him. She is married to Harold Ballinger, a local toy shop owner, and claims to have lived in the town for 12 years. Kate whispers to Ethan that she has learned the best way to survive is to lay low and play along, but Ethan later learns she is leading a rebel group that is working to escape Wayward Pines. When Ethan tells her the truth about what lies beyond the walls of the town, Kate does not believe him, thinking he must have been brainwashed by Pilcher. She tells Theresa, Ethan's wife, that within her first week in town she got a call out to Hassler, who simply told her she was part of a government experiment. Ethan eventually jails Kate and her co-conspirators. While in jail, the conspirators are all shot and killed by Jason Higgins, but Ethan arrives to shoot Jason before he can turn the gun on Kate. In the season 2 opener, Kate survives a surgery performed by Theo Yedlin, only to take her own life after a conversation with Megan Fisher.\n\n\n=== David Pilcher ===\nDavid Pilcher (Toby Jones) is introduced in the series premiere as Dr. Jenkins, a psychiatrist at Wayward Pines Hospital who offers to treat Ethan. After Ethan successfully escapes the town and is in danger of an Abbie attack, Jenkins rescues him by helicopter and for the first time identifies himself as David Pilcher, the scientist who predicted the Abbie mutations and thus created Wayward Pines to save humanity. Pilcher reveals the truth about Wayward Pines and says he needs Ethan's help to maintain order. Ethan eventually defies Pilcher in the penultimate episode of season 1, letting the entire town also know the truth. Angered, Pilcher shuts off the electrified fence, leading to the Abbie attack in the season finale. Pilcher is killed by his own sister, Pam, in that episode, but the character makes multiple appearances in season 2 flashback sequences.\n\n\n=== Theresa Burke ===\nTheresa Burke (Shannyn Sossamon) is Ethan's wife who, along with their son Ben, leaves Seattle to try and find Ethan in season 1. The car that Theresa and Ben are traveling in is sabotaged by Sheriff Pope on the outskirts of town, and crashes. As a Wayward Pines resident, Theresa is offered a job as a realtor when Peter McCall quits. Like Kate, Theresa finds Ethan's \"truths\" regarding Wayward Pines hard to believe, but her job as a realtor allows her to discover the truth on her own, when she locates a passage to Pilcher's mountain complex in an unused lot known as Plot 33. In the complex, she plays a video of Hassler making a report from the ruins of San Francisco, and Ethan's stories now make sense. When she meets Hassler in season 2, Theresa holds him responsible for the deaths of Ethan and Ben. While outside the wall mourning Ben, she is attacked by Abbies. She later dies in the hospital with a despondent Hassler looking on.\n\n\n=== Harold Ballinger ===\nHarold Ballinger (Reed Diamond) is a toymaker and Kate's husband. He is a co-conspirator in Kate's plans to escape the town, getting him jailed by Ethan. While in jail with other conspirators, Harold is shot and killed by Jason Higgins.\n\n\n=== Ben Burke ===\nBen Burke (Charlie Tahan) is Ethan's and Theresa's son. As a member of the First Generation and a student at Wayward Pines Academy, Ben learns the truth about Wayward Pines before his father or mother does. He is \"paired\" with fellow student Amy for purposes of reproduction, and the two seem to have a genuine affection for each other. In the events of the season 1 finale that result in Ethan's death, Ben is injured. He awakes in the hospital to find out from Amy that three years have passed, and Ben walks through the town to see what it has become under Jason's rule. In season 2, Ben leads a group of underground rebels opposed to Jason's iron hand, which gets him banished outside the fence and eventually killed by Abbies.\n\n\n=== Beverly ===\nBeverly (Juliette Lewis) is a bartender in Wayward Pines who bonds with Ethan in the series premiere. She helps him find the decaying corpse of Agent Evans as well as a map of the town. She and Ethan plan an escape, but Beverly is caught and executed by Sheriff Pope in a public reckoning.\nNOTE: Though billed as a main cast member, Lewis only appears in three season 1 episodes. Because of the time it took Wayward Pines to make it to air, Lewis had committed to another series in the interim.\n\n\n=== Adam Hassler ===\nAdam Hassler (Tim Griffin) is Ethan's boss at the Secret Service. In the series premiere, he is shown dispatching Ethan to find Agents Hewson and Stallings. Later that episode, he meets with \"Dr. Jenkins\", who tells him \"everything is going as planned.\" The character makes only sporadic season 1 appearances, one of them in a video report that Theresa finds. In that report from the ruins of San Francisco, Hassler notes that he still hasn't found any humans, only Abbies. In season 2, a bearded and disheveled Hassler makes it back to Wayward Pines, and he is revealed to be one of 12 \"nomads\" Pilcher sent out to assess the earth outside Wayward Pines many years ago. He is the only nomad to make it back alive, and thus knows more about the Abbies than anyone. Having learned that Hassler worked closely with Pilcher, Theresa blames him for the deaths of Ethan and Ben. Through flashbacks, we learn that Hassler fell in love with Theresa when she briefly separated from Ethan over his affair with Kate. Hassler is shown telling Pilcher he wants to \"call it off\" after Theresa and Ben go look for Ethan, but Pilcher just replies \"it's done.\"\n\n\n=== Pamela Pilcher ===\nPamela Pilcher (Melissa Leo) is a nurse at Wayward Pines Hospital and is the first person Ethan sees after waking up in the series premiere. Initially known only as \"Nurse Pam\", she is later revealed to be the sister of David Pilcher. Pam was fanatically devoted to her brother's vision, but begins to have doubts about how he is running the town and treating its citizens, which comes to a head when David shuts off power to the fence. Believing Pam to be undermining him, David orders her to be put back into cryo suspension, but other volunteers rebel on Pam's behalf, freeing her and allowing her to kill her brother in the season 1 finale. Pam makes one appearance in season 2, calling Wayward Pines \"a mistake\" and trying to convince Jason to let the last of humanity die off peacefully. She attempts to infect the townspeople with smallpox virus, but the attempt fails and she is executed by Jason.\n\n\n=== Arnold Pope ===\nArnold Pope (Terrence Howard) is the strict and feared original sheriff of Wayward Pines, serving as Ethan's initial antagonist. In the third episode of season 1, Ethan manages to wrestle Pope's gun from him, then shoots and kills him.\nFlashbacks reveal that Pope was a bright but disgruntled security guard whom Pilcher recruited as a volunteer.\nIn a season 2 flashback, he is shown in Hawaii trying to convince Dr. Theo Yedlin to listen to a proposition.\nNOTE: Though billed as a main cast member in season 1, Howard appeared in only four episodes that season. Because of the time it took Wayward Pines to make it to air, he had committed to another series in the interim.\n\n\n=== Megan Fisher ===\nMegan Fisher (Hope Davis) is an original Wayward Pines resident who becomes a teacher and later principal at Wayward Pines Academy.

She is fanatically devoted to Pilcher's vision, remaining so until her death at the hands of the female Abbie \"Margaret\" in season 2.\n\n\n=== Jason Higgins ===\nJason Higgins (Tom Stevens) is introduced in the 9th episode of season 1 as the leader of the First Generation.

He is in love with Kerry Campbell. After accidentally being shot in the chest during a struggle with Kerry, Theo tries to save him only for Jason to flatline on the operating table. Only Oscar knows that Theo purposely didn't try and save Jason.\n\n\n=== Dr. Theo Yedlin ===\nDr. Theodore \"Theo\" Yedlin (Jason Patric) is a confident, driven surgeon who awakes in Wayward Pines in the season 2 premiere. His medical and leadership skills prove invaluable to the residents of the town. While learning the truth about Wayward Pines, he becomes diametrically opposed to Jason's leadership methods. He is reunited with his wife Rebecca, only to find that she has been a Wayward Pines resident for three years, and that she married Xander. Along with Hassler, Yedlin is the only person who considers the Abbies to be highly intelligent, but his attempt to prove it angers Jason and Megan.\n\n\n=== Rebecca Yedlin ===\nRebecca Yedlin (Nimrat Kaur) is Theo's wife and a successful architect. She is shown in the season 2 premiere having an argument with Theo while they are at a resort in Hawaii.

Mitchum ===\nChristopher James \"C.J.\" Mitchum (Djimon Hounsou) is a historian and an original resident of Wayward Pines.

            "content": "Ignazio Cocchiere (born 19 September 1987) is an Italian footballer who plays as a midfielder or forward for Belgian First Division Amateurs club FCV Dender EH. He signed for FCV Dender EH in 2016 after having previously been one of the crowd favourites for the club Royal Union Saint-Gilloise, having played an integral part in their promotion to the Belgian Second Division during the 2014\u201315 season. Quickly after his arrival at FCV Dender EH he started making an impact at his new club, and with his goals he contributed to a good start to the 2016\u201317 season.\n\n\n== Football career ==\n\n\n=== Youth career ===\nBorn in Varese, Lombardy, Cocchiere started his career in Lombardy team Legnano, where he played for its Berretti under-20 reserve since 2004\u201305 season. Cocchiere also played for a local club in Azzate, the Province of Varese before 2001.\nIn mid-2006 he signed his first professional contract for top Serie A club Internazionale at the age of 18, where he joined the reserve team. Like most of his new Primavera under-20 reserve teammates, Cocchiere received a first-team shirt number of no.56. At the Inter reserves he played in a very strong youth team, featuring Mario Balotelli, Jonathan Biabiany and Leonardo Bonucci among others, resulting in winning the Primavera league.\n\n\n=== Lega Pro ===\nAfter graduation from the Reserves, Cocchiere left for Pizzighettone in late-August 2007. As the club also signed a number of experienced players, the young Cocchiere featured only in two matches that season. In 2008\u201309 Lega Pro Prima Divisione, he was signed by Pro Patria. Cocchiere did not play any game for the first team and the fact that he combined his football career with studying at university meant he looked for opportunities elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nCocchiere found the opportunity to combine both careers when he was signed by Swiss Challenge League club Nyon in 2010, and he simultaneously enrolled in Political Science at the University of Geneva. As a result of the Swiss maximum number of foreign players he was initially loaned out to Swiss 1. Liga club Baulmes. Here he had a successful run of games playing an attacking right-back and contributed to the club's great form with an impressive number of 7 goals in 12 games. His goal scoring record attracted the attention of a number of first league clubs and this contributed to the decision of Nyon to call him back to the club and add him to the squad in summer of 2010. However, after only a handful appearances partly due to a rare injury in his career, Cocchiere was released in summer of 2011 when he decided not to accept any of the received offer from Swiss Second Division clubs and to return to Italy to finish his university degree.\n\n\n=== Serie D ===\nCocchiere then returned to Italy to finish he master's degree Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore at and signed for Serie D club Gallaratese. At the club he scored 5 goals in 11 games. On 4 January 2012 he was signed by Caronnese, where he stayed for one season during which he finished his degree.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nCocchiere moved to Brussels where he signed for Royal Union Saint-Gilloise and combined his football career with a career working for the European Parliament. After some very successful seasons playing for Union and scoring some crucial memorable goals, Cocchiere started featuring less in the starting eleven during season 2015-2016, much to the disliking of many of the fans. This eventually lead to his departure and Cocchiere found a new challenge at FCV Dender EH, signing a one-year contract with an option of one more year. He quoted the reputation and great infrastructure of the club as some of the reasons for signing. Here he quickly found his rhythm and form; being voted as 'Man of the Match' by Dender fans on frequent occasions and scoring 12 goals in his first 16 official games. His successful first season, seeing him netting already 18 goals, led the club to offering him an improved contract in April 2017, shortly before the league's playoffs.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n\n=== European Parliament ===\nIgnazio Cocchiere has always combined his professional football career with academic activities, studying at university in many of the countries he played. Having successfully combined his studies with practicing his sport full-time, he continued combining both careers also after graduation. In Brussels he found a job working at the European Parliament, where he has worked for more than three years now. In his interview with Eurosport on April 25 April 2017, he recommended all young football player to keep an alternative career path in mind and stressed that his job in the European Parliament was another reason he expects to be playing football in Belgium the years to come. As a result of playing for local cult club Royale Union Saint-Gilloise and working in the so-called 'Brussels Bubble' Cocchiere has become a well-known and respected figure in the local scene, resulting regularly in a lot of media coverage.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwiss Football League Profile (in German)",

            "content": "Farewell is an American pop punk band formed in 2004 in Greensboro, North Carolina. They were signed to Epitaph Records releasing two CDs. After fulfilling their contractual obligations with the release of their second CD, the relationship with Epitaph ended.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe band released its debut EP on May 24, 2005, entitled Poisoning the Lark, on Forsaken Records.\nAfter posting new tracks on their MySpace page, Farewell was scouted by the owner of Epitaph Records, Brett Gurewitz who offered them a deal in March 2007. The band's first full-length album, Isn't This Supposed to Be Fun? appeared on the label on September 25, 2007. The album was released in The UK on February 4, 2008. Farewell was slated to tour the UK with Cartel in 2008, but the tour was cancelled. They then proceeded to tour the UK with You Me at Six and Houston Calls in October 2008.\nFarewell cites punk rock bands such as Green Day, Jawbreaker and Alkaline Trio as influences. On July 25, 2008, Chris Lee left the band. On April 22, 2009, Kevin Carter was named The Triad's Best Guitarist of 2009 in YES! Weekly's reader's choice awards. Their second album entitled Run It Up the Flagpole was released on September 1, 2009.\nAfter a hiatus in 2010, Farewell announced on October 16, 2011 that they are working on a new album to be released in the winter of 2012. Farewell once again began writing new material in the summer of 2013, though no new release date has been confirmed from the band.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums and EPs ===\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFarewell's page on Epitaph",

            "content": "Lim Jeong-hyun (born July 5, 1984), also known by the online alias funtwo, is a South Korean guitarist known for his cover of the piece Canon Rock.\n\n\n== Canon Rock cover ==\n\nLim played and recorded his cover of \"Canon Rock\" by JerryC in 2005. He uploaded his video to the popular South Korean music website Mule.co.kr. A YouTube user named \"guitar90\" uploaded the Mule video to YouTube under the title guitar, with the introductory comment \"this guy iz great!!!\" The identity of guitar90 is unknown.\nIn March 2016, the original YouTube video was restored and is once again publicly available. The video still holds the views before it was taken down in 2011.\nLim's cover of \"Canon Rock\" has been mentioned on CNN, 20/20, The New York Times, and National Public Radio, in addition to MBC news, CBC Radio, KBS news, and other South Korean news stations.\nMany viewers have speculated and thought of the video as fake because the audio is not synchronized with the video. Lim later stated to The New York Times that this had to do with the fact that \"he recorded the audio and video independently and then matched them inexactly.\" The performance itself was recorded in two parts, and edited together. An image of a traffic light was used to make the transition.\n\n\n== Other activities ==\nLim has now started to arrange well-known music by himself. He composed a holiday card to his fans called \"Carol Rock (funtwo Is Coming to Town)\", a rock version of \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\". He also played Dream Theater's \"Overture 1928\", and recently he posted a video of himself performing Antonio Vivaldi's \"Summer\" from the Four Seasons, one of Vivaldi's most famous works.\nLim initially expressed no wish to carry on playing as a professional guitarist. However his online fame has allowed him to play to live audiences several times\u2014 once for the South Korean ambassador in Washington, DC, then again at the KORUS festival the same year. At the KORUS festival, Lim played improvised, altered versions of the Korean national anthem and the American national anthem. The third time he played was in 2008, the November 22, at the YouTube Live festival where he performed with Joe Satriani, he played first a mix of Canon Rock and Joe's \"Surfing With the Alien\" and then \"Canon Rock\". In October 2009, he was a featured performer at the fall ICANN meeting's welcoming ceremony and later joined in at their music night. In the same interview in which he stated his wish to carry on playing guitar simply as a hobby, he also rated his own playing a modest 50/60 out of 100.\nThe beginning of the music video for Weezer's song \"Pork and Beans\" is set in Lim's iconic room, with the various members playing their various instruments. The video as a whole contains references to numerous other internet phenomena.\n\n\n== Onesided ==\nIn March, 2010, Lim formed a band One Sided with former Pyon member Han Lee, Hwiju Park and Chris Lee, in Auckland, New Zealand. The band features Han Lee on vocals and rhythm guitar, Lim on lead guitar, Chris Lee on keyboard.\n\n\n== Pieces ==\n\n\n=== Funtwo ===\nCanon Rock\nOverture 1928\nSummer\nCarol (funtwo is coming to town)\nMission (Main Theme)\nI'm Alright (Neil Zaza)\nTriptych (Daita of Siam Shade)\nZenith (Daita)\nHappy Birthday To You\nBumble\nMule Jam Project (Remix of Smoke on the Water by Deep Purple)\nCarol 2009\n\n\n=== Onesided ===\nEnemies\nLet It\nHands On Me\nWhen Butterflies Come\nAgainst the Flow\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nThe REAL Real Funtwo Comes Forward: By His Pinky You Will Know Him\n\n\n== External links ==\nOriginal 2005 Video\nOfficial Website\nYoutube Channel\nCanon Rock Video on YouTube\nWeb Guitar Wizard Revealed at Last\nPachelbel makeover makes a web superstar\nWikiGuitarist",

The town had a hotel, post office, and blacksmith. John Lakson, the town's interpreter, submitted the name of either \"Suomi\" or \"Suoma,\" which is Finnish for Finland, to the Post Office Department, but his handwriting was misread.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe cemetery and town rests in Butte County, South Dakota.

            "content": "The Gridley-Parson-Staples House is a historic house museum at 1554 Farmington Avenue in Farmington, Connecticut. Probably built about 1760, it is the oldest surviving house in northwestern Farmington, and a fine example of 18th century Georgian architecture. It is now home to the Farmington Historical Society, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nThe Gridley-Parson-Staples House is located on the east side of Farmington Avenue (Connecticut Route 4) amid a cluster of municipal buildings, including the town hall, public library, and high school. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, two interior brick chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Colonial Revival flat-roof portico supported by Doric columns. Above the entrance is a three-part Palladian style window with narrow side windows; the other windows on the facade are standard 6-over-6 sash. A 1-1/2 story ell, possibly of older construction, extends to the rear. The interior of the house follows a center-hall plan, with an unusually wide central hall, and an enclosed stair. The downstairs fireplace surrounds exhibit particularly fine 18th-century carving.\nThe construction date of the house and the rear ell are uncertain, owing to a lack of documentary record and conflicting architectural evidence. Construction of the rear ell is traditionally given as 1732, when Thomas Hurlburt owned this property, but it appears to have been extensively altered around 1760, when the main house was probably built by Elnathan Gridley. A house is documented as appearing here on a 1759 map, and the house was likely near its present form in 1781, when Elnathan Gridley's estate was inventoried. The property associated with the house originally extended all the way down to the Farmington River (across Farmington Avenue). The house underwent a major restoration in 1976, and now houses museum displays and offices of the historical society.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford County, Connecticut\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFarmington Historical Society",

He was born at Marylebone in London and died at Lavenham, Suffolk.\nEducated at Winchester College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, Longden took a Bachelor of Laws degree at Cambridge, graduating in 1841. His cricket at Cambridge was limited to two games for the university against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in which he batted in the lower middle order and does not appear to have bowled: in both cases, the full scorecard has not survived, and it is not known if he was right- or left-handed. There was no University Match against Oxford in the 1837 season.\nAfter leaving Cambridge, Longden was ordained as a Church of England priest; he was curate at Groton, Suffolk from 1851 and rector of Brent Eleigh, also in Suffolk, from 1860 until his death in 1895. The account of his funeral in the Bury and Norwich Post newspaper indicates that he was married and had three sons.\n\n\n== References ==",

It was especially used by the Stoic philosophers at Rome as the pallium philosophicum, just as the Greek philosophers were accustomed to distinguish themselves by a particular dress. Hence the expression of Juvenal facinus majoris abollae merely signifies, \"a crime committed by a very deep philosopher\".\nThe word abolla is actually a Latinization of the Greek ambolla (\u1f00\u03bc\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1) or anabole (\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae), for a loose woolen cloak.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPallium\nPaenula\nClothing in ancient Rome\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Other sources ===\nThe Wordsworth Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Smith, William, ed.

They culminate in the 511-metre (1,677 ft) peak of Stronend, which overlooks Strathendrick and the village of Fintry.\nLike the neighbouring Gargunnock Hills they are composed of volcanic rocks, mainly lavas and tuffs erupted in the Carboniferous period.\nThe northern, western and southern sides of the hills are defined by a steep and craggy escarpment, whilst the eastern sides run more gently down into the valley of the Backside Burn and Endrick Water. The Boquhan Burn, which runs initially northeastwards, drops over the northern scarp at the Spout of Ballochleam. Loch Walton lies at the foot of the hills\u2019 southern slopes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nimages of Fintry Hills on Geograph website",

            "content": "A tenrec is any species of mammal within the family Tenrecidae, found on Madagascar and in parts of the African mainland. Tenrecs are widely diverse; as a result of convergent evolution they resemble hedgehogs, shrews, opossums, mice and even otters. They occupy aquatic, arboreal, terrestrial and fossorial environments. Some of these species, including the greater hedgehog tenrec, can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nTenrecs are small mammals of variable body form. The smallest species are the size of shrews, with a body length of around 4.5 cm (1.8 in), and weighing just 5 g (0.18 oz), while the largest, the common or tailless tenrec, is 25 to 39 cm (9.8 to 15.4 in) in length, and can weigh over 1 kilogram (2.2 lb). Although they may resemble shrews, hedgehogs, or otters, they are not closely related to any of these groups, their closest relatives being other African insectivorous mammals, such as golden moles and elephant shrews. The common ancestry of these animals, along with aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, and sea cows in the group Afrotheria, was not recognized until the late 1990s. Continuing work on the molecular and morphological diversity of afrotherian mammals has provided ever increasing support for their common ancestry.\nUnusual among placental mammals, the anus and urogenital tracts of tenrecs share a common opening, or cloaca, a feature more commonly seen in birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They have a low body temperature, sufficiently so that they do not require a scrotum to cool their sperm as do most other mammals.\nAll species appear to be at least somewhat omnivorous, with invertebrates forming the largest part of their diets. The three species found on the African mainland (Potamogale velox, Micropotamogale lamottei, M. ruwenzorii) have more specialized diets, centered on their habitat in fast-running streams of the African tropics, from Liberia in the west to Lake Victoria in the east. One species from Madagascar, Limnogale mergulus, is also semiaquatic. All of the species from Madagascar, semiaquatic or not, appear to have evolved from a single, common ancestor, with the mainland tenrecs comprising the next, most-closely related mammalian species. While the fossil record of tenrecs is scarce, at least some specimens from the early Miocene of Kenya show close affinities to living species from Madagascar, such as Geogale aurita.\nMost species are nocturnal and have poor eyesight. Their other senses are well developed, however, and they have especially sensitive whiskers. As with many of their other features, the dental formula of tenrecs varies greatly between species; they can have from 32 to 42 teeth in total. Unusual for mammals, the permanent dentition in tenrecs tends not to completely erupt until well after adult body size has been reached. This is one of several anatomical features shared by elephants, hyraxes, sengis, and golden moles (but apparently not aardvarks), consistent with their descent from a common ancestor.\nTenrecs have a gestation period of 50 to 64 days, and give birth to a number of relatively undeveloped young. While the otter shrews have just two young per litter, the tailless tenrec can have as many as 32, and females possess up to 29 teats, more than any other mammal. At least some tenrec species are social, living in multigenerational family groups with over a dozen individuals.\n\n\n== Interaction with humans ==\nIn the island nation of Mauritius, and also on the Comoran island of Mayotte, some of the inhabitants eat tenrec meat, though it is difficult to obtain (as it is not sold in shops or markets) and difficult to prepare correctly.\nThe lesser hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi) is one of 16 mammalian species that will have its genome sequenced as part of the Mammalian Genome Project. It is increasingly popular in the pet trade, and in the future may serve as an important model organism in biomedicine, as it is only distantly related to the mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rhesus macaques that comprise the most common research animals.\n\n\n== Species ==\nThe four subfamilies, 10 genera, and 34 species of tenrecs are:\nFAMILY TENRECIDAE\nSubfamily Geogalinae\nGenus Geogale\nLarge-eared tenrec (Geogale aurita)\n\nSubfamily Oryzorictinae\nGenus Limnogale\nWeb-footed tenrec (Limnogale mergulus)\n\nGenus Microgale\nShort-tailed shrew tenrec (Microgale brevicaudata)\nCowan's shrew tenrec (Microgale cowani)\nDobson's shrew tenrec (Microgale dobsoni)\nDrouhard's shrew tenrec (Microgale drouhardi)\nDryad shrew tenrec (Microgale dryas)\nPale shrew tenrec (Microgale fotsifotsy)\nGracile shrew tenrec (Microgale gracilis)\nGrandidier's shrew tenrec (Microgale grandidieri)\nNaked-nosed shrew tenrec (Microgale gymnorhyncha)\nJenkins' shrew tenrec (Microgale jenkinsae)\nNorthern shrew tenrec (Microgale jobihely)\nLesser long-tailed shrew tenrec (Microgale longicaudata)\nMicrogale macpheei (extinct)\nMajor's long-tailed tenrec (Microgale majori)\nMontane shrew tenrec (Microgale monticola)\nNasolo's shrew tenrec (Microgale nasoloi)\nPygmy shrew tenrec (Microgale parvula)\nGreater long-tailed shrew tenrec (Microgale principula)\nLeast shrew tenrec (Microgale pusilla)\nShrew-toothed shrew tenrec (Microgale soricoides)\nTaiva shrew tenrec (Microgale taiva)\nTalazac's shrew tenrec (Microgale talazaci)\nThomas's shrew tenrec (Microgale thomasi)\n\nGenus Oryzorictes\nMole-like rice tenrec (Oryzorictes hova)\nFour-toed rice tenrec (Oryzorictes tetradactylus)\n\nSubfamily Potamogalinae\nGenus Micropotamogale\nNimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei)\nRuwenzori otter shrew (Micropotamogale ruwenzorii)\n\nGenus Potamogale\nGiant otter shrew (Potamogale velox)\n\nSubfamily Tenrecinae\nGenus Echinops\nLesser hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi)\n\nGenus Hemicentetes\nHighland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes nigriceps)\nLowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus)\n\nGenus Setifer\nGreater hedgehog tenrec (Setifer setosus)\n\nGenus Tenrec\nCommon tenrec (Tenrec ecaudatus)\n\n\n== See also ==\nConvergent evolution\nList of mammals of Madagascar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBizarre mammals filmed calling using their quills at BBC Online, video with commentary by Sir David Attenborough\nView the echTel2 genome assembly in the UCSC Genome Browser.\nPodcast about hibernation which focusses on tenrecs in the last third.",

            "content": "Loben Edward Harold Maund (26 September 1892 \u2013 18 June 1957) was a rear admiral of the British Royal Navy, who served in World War I and World War II. He was the captain of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal when she was sunk in November 1941, but went on to serve in Combined Operations, playing an important role in the development of landing craft.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMaund was born in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, the son of Edward Arthur Maund and Eleanora Hawkesworth. Entering the Navy on 15 September 1905, he was trained at the Royal Naval Colleges at Osborne and Dartmouth, and was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant on 30 July 1913.\nMaund served throughout World War I, being promoted to lieutenant on 30 December 1914, serving on the Dover Patrol, in the Grand Fleet and in Atlantic convoys, and seeing action at the battle of Jutland in mid-1916. From 1 March 1918 until January 1919 he served as commander of the destroyer Scorpion.\nMaund was promoted to lieutenant-commander on 30 December 1922, and in mid-1923 had Wireless Signal duties in the Director of Training and Staff Duties Division, before being assigned in September as Staff Officer (Operations) to the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies aboard the cruiser Chatham until January 1925. In 1926 he served aboard the cruiser Caradoc in the Mediterranean, before being appointed Executive Officer of the cruiser Curlew in June 1927.\nPromoted to commander on 31 December 1927, Maund served as Naval Assistant Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence until October 1930, when he was appointed Executive Officer of the aircraft carrier Furious in September 1931. He returned to shore to attend a Senior Officers' War Course at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich in late 1933, receiving promotion to captain on 30 June 1934 to serve in the Training and Staff Duties Division, and as an Assistant Director of Plans at the Admiralty from June 1935.\nFrom August 1936 Maund spent a year as commander of the cruiser Danae on the China Station. In early 1938 he attended another senior officers' course at Greenwich, before being appointed Commandant of the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre based at Portsmouth, where he was tasked with developing methods and equipment to use in Combined Operations. From April to June 1940 he served as Naval Chief of Staff to the Flag Officer, Narvik, during the Norwegian Campaign, receiving a Mention in Despatches on 26 September 1940. He then served in the Operations Division of the Admiralty.\n\n\n=== Ark Royal and afterward ===\n\nOn 19 April 1941 Maund succeeded Captain Cedric Holland in command of the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, taking part in the operation to sink the battleship Bismarck, for which he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) on 14 October 1941; he also sailed with three Malta Convoys, receiving a second Mention in Despatches on 6 January 1942 for his part in Operation Halberd. On 13 November 1941 Ark Royal was hit by a torpedo from U-81; she eventually broke in two and sank the next morning. Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was established to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Maund was court-martialled for negligence in February 1942. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund, and that he was primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.\nOn 17 May 1942 Maund was appointed Director of Combined Operations, Middle East, based at Alexandria, with the rank of acting rear admiral, receiving a third Mention in Despatches on 21 December 1943 for his part in Operation Husky - the Allied invasion of Sicily - in July 1943. Maund was officially placed on the Retired List on 8 July 1943; but on 25 August 1943, he was appointed Director of Combined Operations, India, based in Bombay: he arrived there on 16 October. Maund returned to the UK and from 1 October 1944 until July 1945 served as Rear-Admiral, Landing Ships and Craft. He was promoted to rear admiral on 1 March 1946.\n\n\n== Post-naval career ==\nMaund became a director of the scientific instrument makers A. Kershaw & Sons, Ltd. of Leeds, and wrote a book Assault from the Sea, published in 1949 by Methuen & Co., London, which was his account of the development of the Royal Navy's landing craft and their use operationally between 1939 and 1945. Rear-Admiral Maund died at Fittleworth, Sussex, on 18 June 1957.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMaund married Edith Mary Collins; they had two sons, Lieutenant Michael Richard Maund, FAA, (1915\u20131943) and Loben Spencer, who died aged three years, one daughter Rosalind Mary born 1919. In 1933 he married Constance Alice Macartney Iredell.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Wastewater comes out of the laundry process with additional energy (heat), lint, soil, dyes, finishing agents, and other chemicals from detergents. Some laundry wastewater goes directly into the environment, due to the flaws of water infrastructure. The majority goes to sewage treatment plants before flowing into the environment. Some chemicals remain in the water after treatment, which may contaminate the water system. They can be toxic to wildlife, or can lead to eutrophication.\n\n\n== General influences of laundry wastewater ==\nData shows that United States has more than 35,000 laundries. On the average, a single laundry can discharge 400 m3 of wastewater every day. Annually, about 5.11 km3 laundry wastewater is produced, which can fill 1,460 Superdomes in New Orleans.\n\n\n=== Treatment of laundry wastewater ===\nThere are several parameters in the evaluation of laundry wastewater: temperature, pH-value, suspended substances, Cl2, sediment substances, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrogen ammonia, chemical oxygen demand(COD), biochemical oxygen demand(BOD5), anionic surfactants.\n\n\n=== Chemicals in detergents ===\nSeveral common detergent ingredients are surfactants, builders, bleach-active compounds and auxiliary agents. The surfactants can be classified into anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants. The most widely used surfactant linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) is an anionic surfactant. In builders, sodium triphosphate, zeolite A, sodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) are the most important substances. Bleach-active compounds are usually sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate. Enzymes and fluorescent whitening agents are added into detergents as auxiliary agents.\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\n\n\n=== Environmental harm of surfactants ===\nSurfactants own both hydrophilic and lipophilic properties in one molecule, so they are called surface active agents, and are widely used in various washing process. With the lipophilic tails, surfactants are biologically active. Anionic surfactants have the ability of binding to bioactive macromolecules like enzymes, DNA, peptides, causing changes of surface charge and the folding of polypeptide chain(structure of protein). The function of proteins will be different. Cationic surfactant can bind to the inner membrane of bacteria, and by this way disorganize the bacteria through their long alkyl chain. Nonionic surfactants are able to bind to both proteins and phospholipid membrane, leading to leakage of low molecular mass compounds by increasing the permeability of membranes and vesicles. This may result in serious damage in cells or even cell death.\n\u2014LAS and its biodegradation\nLinear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) with the formula of C12H25C6H4SO3Na, also known as sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, is the most widely used anionic surfactant in laundry detergent because it has minimal environmental impact for its readily biodegradation.\nA complete biodegradation under aerobic conditions consists of two steps, primary biodegradation and ultimate biodegradation. The first step begins from the terminal carbon in the alkyl chain as omega-oxidation, which can start from one or both ends, then is followed by beta-oxidation. After the first step the residual is sulfophenyl(di)carboxylates (SP(d)Cs), a large molecule which can be involved in the second step. The second step occurs only when the required bacteria exist. The ring cleavage of benzene and the further desulphonation of the mono- and dicarboxyilic sulphophenyl acids happen. After the two-step biodegradation, LAS is degraded into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic salts and residual biomass. During the biodegradation, several specific bacteria and oxygen are required in both omega-oxidation of the alkyl chain and the benzene ring cleaving process, so this biodegradation can only happen in aerobic conditions. In anaerobic conditions in treatment process, LAS shows no change. Researchers also prove that biodegradation process is restricted in 20\u201340 mg/L and even inhibited at a higher concentration, which leads to the incomplete biodegradation of LAS in sewage treatment plants.\n\n\n=== Harm of builders to the environment ===\nBuilders in detergents are water softeners, which can remove calcium and magnesium ions by complexation or precipitation in a hard water (water contains a lot of calcium and magnesium).\nSodium triphosphate, with a formula of Na5P3O10, is a largely used builder in laundry detergents, which can lead to eutrophication caused by phosphorus (P). P is needed for energy transfer, the formation of DNA, RNA and many other intermediary metabolites. Only P in orthophosphate can be assimilated by autotrophs, other P compounds like sodium triphosphate can be chemically or enzymatically hydrolyzed to orthophosphate. The mechanism is shown below.\n\nExcessive phosphorus can make for excessive production of autotrophs, like algae and cyanobacteria, leading to eutrophication in an inorganic nutrient pathway. Nutrient enrichment in lakes and reservoirs results in the microscopic floating plants, algae and formation of dense mats of larger floating plants that can produce oxygen by photosynthesis. When they die and sink to the bottom, they consume oxygen in decomposition. Bacteria thriving in this process consume oxygen. With the depletion of oxygen, fishes die and anaerobic bacteria produce methane, hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which can destroy the ecosystem.\n\n\n== Prevention ==\nTo reduce the eutrophication caused by sodium triphosphate, there are phosphorus-free builders substitutes nowadays, such as inorganic builders zeolite A and soda ash, and organic builders like polycarboxylates, citrates et al.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Ignacio Saturnino \"Lou\" Molinet (November 30, 1904 \u2013 August 27, 1976) was a football player who played in the National Football League for the Frankford Yellow Jackets during the 1927 season. He is distinguished as being the first Cuban and Latin American to play in the league.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDespite having a French name, Molinet, Lou's parents had come to Cuba from Spain, their ancestors likely crossed the Pyrenees Mountains from France. He was educated primarily in America, attending prep school in New Jersey before enrolling at Cornell University, where he followed in the footsteps of his older brother, Joaquin, who was later inducted into the Cornell Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Football career ==\nMolinet lettered twice each in basketball and football. However, after his sophomore year ended, both of his parents died. He found the prospect of returning to Cornell too challenging, so he remained at home in Cuba. But when the Frankford Athletic Association in Philadelphia contacted him about playing for the Frankford Yellow Jackets, the defending NFL champion, he returned. The team contracted Molinet for a salary of $50 per game. In addition, he received $50 per week just to attend practice.\nIn 1927, Molinet rushed for 75 yards and passed for another 35 yards. He also caught several passes, and even scored a touchdown during a Yellow Jackets' win over the Buffalo Bison. He played in nine NFL games that season and the Yellow Jackets fell below .500 good for 7th place in the standings. Molinet returned to Cornell, finished his degree and lived a life far away from football. At the time of his death, his own family knew very little of his athletic career outside of college.\n\n\n== Later life and legacy ==\nMolinet spent his later life working at Eastman Kodak. He actually worked for the Carrier Corporation, first in New York City, then in Rochester and then in Syracuse. Many in media referred to him as \"Lou\" Molinet. However his family states he was never called that. His nicknames were really \"Molly,\" and \"Iggy\".\nPrior to 1999, it was concluded that Jess Rodriguez, a fullback with the 1929 Buffalo Bisons, was the first NFL player of Hispanic heritage. However, in 2000, Heidi Cadwell, Molinet's granddaughter, contacted the Pro Football Hall of Fame about donating her grandfather's NFL contract from 1927. Her call was of great interest to the Hall because at the time it was widely believed that Rodriguez was the first Hispanic player in NFL history. Further research by the Hall of Fame and Hispanic historian Mario Longoria confirmed that, in fact, Molinet played in the NFL in 1927. Today Molinet's contract is prominently displayed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Joshua A. Barro is an American journalist who currently contributes to Business Insider as a political commentator.\n\n\n== Family and education ==\nBarro's father, who is of Italian descent, is the Harvard professor and macroeconomist Robert Barro. After growing up in Massachusetts, Barro received a bachelor's degree in psychology from Harvard University. While in college, he spent a summer interning for Grover Norquist.\n\n\n== Career ==\nBarro previously worked as a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, as a real estate banker for Wells Fargo, as the lead writer for the Ticker, an economics and politics blog hosted by Bloomberg L.P., and as the politics editor at Business Insider.\nHe appears regularly on Bloomberg Television and MSNBC and has appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO and on All In with Chris Hayes on MSNBC.\nIn early 2013, he was a prominent supporter of a potential trillion dollar coin, but by late 2013, he had changed his mind.\nTime named Barro's Twitter feed one of \"The 140 Best Twitter Feeds of 2013,\" one of ten in the Politics category. In 2012, Forbes selected him as one of the \"30 Under 30\" media \"brightest stars under the age of 30,\" and David Brooks listed him as part of the \"vibrant and increasingly influential center-right conversation.\" A former aide to Barack Obama included Barro on a short list of Obama's favorite columnists. He is currently the host and moderator of KCRW's Left, Right & Center.\nIn 2014, Barro left Business Insider to join The New York Times' \"The Upshot.\" In 2016, Barro was again hired by Business Insider as a senior editor.\n\n\n== Views ==\nEarly in his career, Barro described himself as Republican but criticized many policies. He also identified as a neoliberal.. Barro has been opposed to traditional Christian beliefs regarding homosexuality, stating that they \"linger and oppress\" and must be \"stamped out ruthlessly\".\nAfter the 2012 United States elections, Barro became increasingly critical of the Republican Party and wrote that \"the party\u2019s economic agenda, as embodied in the latest Ryan budget, is simply terrible for the vast majority of Americans.\" Barro called Congressional Republicans \"crazy and awful\". Reactions by other conservatives in the media led The Atlantic to name Barro \"the loneliest Republican.\" Ezra Klein said that based on Barro's views, \"He doesn't come across as much of a Republican.\"\nOn October 11, 2016, following the Republican Party's nomination of Donald Trump for president, Barro said he had left the Republican Party and registered as a Democrat. Barro cited as reasons for his decision the \"fact-free environment so many of its voters live in, and because of the anti-Democrat hysteria that had been willfully whipped up by so many of its politicians,\" which created a \"vulnerability in our democracy.\"\n\n\n=== Hamburger problem ===\nBarro used the term hamburger problem to criticize the perceived tendency of some progressives in the US to hassle people on their personal choices. For example, eating meat hamburgers can be criticized based on the arguments that it's harmful for animals, it contributes to global warming, and it's unhealthy.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nBarro lives in Manhattan, New York and is gay. In 2017, he married Zachary Allen, chairman of TIPAH Consulting and a former Democratic National Committee official. He is also an atheist.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJosh Barro articles at Business Insider.",

            "content": "HMCS Nipigon was an Annapolis-class destroyer that served in the Royal Canadian Navy and later the Canadian Forces. She was the second Canadian naval unit to carry this name. Entering service in 1964, she was named for the Nipigon River that flows through Ontario.\nNipigon served throughout the Cold War on the Atlantic coast of Canada. She was paid off in 1998 and sold for use as an artificial reef off the coast of Quebec.\n\n\n== Design and description ==\nThe Royal Canadian Navy had intended to place a six ship order under the Mackenzie class of destroyer escorts; however, during the design phase, the last two vessels ordered were altered to the St. Laurent-class DDH design and were classed under the new Annapolis designation.\nThe ships measured 366 feet (112 m) in length, with a beam of 42 feet (13 m) and a draught of 13 feet 2 inches (4.01 m). Initially, the ships displaced 2,400 tonnes (2,400 long tons) and had a complement of 228.\nThe ships were powered by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers connected to the two-shaft English-Electric geared steam turbines providing 30,000 shaft horsepower (22,000 kW). This gave the ships a maximum speed of 28 knots (52 km/h; 32 mph).\nThe ships were initially armed with two 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber dual-purpose guns mounted in a single turret forward. The extra topweight of the helicopter required the return of the American Mk 33 3-inch gun over the heavier 3-inch/70 caliber guns used on the preceding class. The guns could fire 45 \u2013 50 rounds per minute with a lifespan of 2,050 rounds. The guns were placed in a Mk 33 mount. The mounting allowed the guns to elevate from \u221215\u00b0 to 85\u00b0. The elevation rate was 30\u00b0 per second and train rate was 24\u00b0 per second. The mounts could train 360\u00b0.\nFor anti-submarine warfare, the ships were armed with a Mk 10 Limbo mortar. The Limbo was a British-designed three-barrel mortar capable of launching a projectile shell between 400\u20131,000 yards (370\u2013910 m). Placed on stabilized mountings, the projectiles always entered the water at the same angle. The total weight of the shell was 390 pounds (180 kg). They also had a Mk.4 thrower with homing torpedoes.\nInitially the ships were outfitted with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar, and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For sensing below the surface, the class was given one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar, one SQS-503 hull mounted active search sonar and one SQS-504 VDS medium frequency active search sonar. For fire control purposes they were given one Mk 64 GFCS fire control with SPG-48 tracker (GUNAR).\n\nThe two Annapolis-class destroyers were built late enough to incorporate the helicopter hangar retrofitted to the St. Laurent class and the \"Beartrap\" haul-down device. This allowed the destroyer escorts to deploy with one CH-124 Sea King helicopter.\n\n\n=== DELEX refit ===\nThe DEstroyer Life EXtension (DELEX) refit was born out of the need to extend the life of the steam-powered destroyer escorts of the Canadian Navy in the 1980s until the next generation of surface ship was built. Encompassing all the classes based on the initial St. Laurent (the remaining St. Laurent, Restigouche, Mackenzie, and Annapolis-class vessels), the DELEX upgrades were meant to improve their ability to combat modern Soviet submarines, and to allow them to continue to operate as part of NATO task forces.\nThe Annapolis class received the same sensor and communications upgrades that others in the St Laurent family of ships received, including the installation of a new tactical data system (ADLIPS), updated radars and sonars, fire control and satellite navigation. They also received the new Canadian Tactical Towed Array Sensor or CANTASS which was a long-range towed sonar array that was affixed to the stern, which replaced the older VDS. The class also received a new lattice mast.\nThey were given 12.75-inch (324 mm) torpedo tubes to allow them to fire Mark 46 torpedoes. However, the Limbo mortar was removed in order to install the CANTASS. This visibly altered the overall appearance of the ships.\n\n\n== Construction and career ==\n\nNipigon was ordered in 1958, initially as a repeat Restigouche-class vessel. However, in 1959, the last two repeat Restigouches were altered to incorporate variable depth sonar and a helicopter landing area and became a separate class. The ship was laid down on 5 August 1960 by Marine Industries Ltd. at Sorel and launched on 10 December 1961. Her construction was overseen by Cdr Donald Clark CD, who also oversaw the laying-down and commencement of HMCS Bras d'Or. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 30 May 1964 with classification number 266 and with the wife of the then Governor-General Georges Vanier, Madame Pauline Vanier, as her sponsor. She was actually the first vessel to commission in the class. In 1964, the ship escorted the royal yacht HMY Britannia on its tour of Canada.\nOn 18 October 1965, a fire broke out in the fuel-handling room, killing one and seriously injuring others. Eight crew members were evacuated to HMCS Bonaventure.\n\nNipigon served most of her career with the RCN and later Canadian Forces' Atlantic Fleet. During her service with Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT), she was primarily used as a training ship. After the discovery of cracks in the boilers of HMCS Ottawa, all the Annapolis-class destroyers were temporarily taken out of service for an inspection in 1981. However, no cracks were discovered in Nipigon. In 1982, Nipigon was tasked with searching for and recovering any survivors from Ocean Ranger, a semi-submersible oil platform that had sunk in heavy seas. Nipigon's DELEX refit was performed by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, taking place from 27 June 1983 to 22 August 1984 and cost $16 million.\nOn 28 April 1985, the warship shelled and sank the fishing trawler Lady Majorie after it had been abandoned by its crew and became a hazard to navigation. Initially the decision was questioned, but Nipigon was later cleared by a Canadian Coast Guard report. In June 1985, Nipigon, while participating in naval exercises, suffered structural damage after a 15-metre (49 ft) stress crack sheared 215 rivets in the vessel's superstructure. The problem was not resolved until 1986. On 27 February 1987, her CH-124 helicopter rescued crewmen from the tug Gulf Gale which had caught fire off Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. The ship became the second to have a mixed-gender crew in the Canadian Forces in September 1987.\nNipigon underwent another refit, this time at Port Weller, Ontario beginning on 30 August 1988 and lasting to 16 February 1990. In August 1991, the destroyer was deployed to STANAVFORLANT, the standing NATO fleet. In May 1993, Nipigon took part in commemorative events remembering the Battle of the Atlantic in Liverpool and off the Welsh coast. In 1995, Nipigon was deployed into the Atlantic as a guard ship during the Turbot War. In June 1995, the destroyer intercepted the Spanish fishing vessel Patricia Nores, and boarded her just outside Canada's exclusive economic zone. Eleven tonnes of unrecorded turbot catch was found aboard Patricia Nores in a secret compartment.\nShe was decommissioned from the Canadian Forces on 2 July 1998 and sold for use as an artificial reef. She was sunk in the St. Lawrence River north-east of Rimouski, Quebec on 22 July 2003.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nHMCS Nipigon Artificial Reef, Rimouski Quebec Canada\nNipigon Scubapedia",
