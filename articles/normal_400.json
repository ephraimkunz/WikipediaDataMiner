It is situated at Via della Conciliazione, Vatican City, Rome.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Pontifical Academy of Theology was founded by Clement XI in 1718, and fostered by Benedict XIII, Clement XIV, and then by Gregory XVI who on 26 October 1838 drafted statutes for it. On 28 January 1999 Pope John Paul II renewed the statutes. The purpose of the Academy is to form well-trained theologians and promote dialogue between faith and reason, while presenting the Christian message in a way that meets the needs of our time, so that the message of Christ might be embodied in all peoples' lives and cultures.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGlobal organisation of the Catholic Church\nIndex of Vatican City-related articles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPontifical Academies - Website of the Holy See",

As of the 2010 United States Census, the borough's population was 870, reflecting a decline of 159 (-15.5%) from the 1,029 counted in the 2000 Census, which had in turn declined by 16 (-1.5%) from the 1,045 counted in the 1990 Census.\nThe Borough of Hi-Nella was created on April 23, 1929, from Clementon Township, one of seven municipalities created from the now-defunct township, and one of five new municipalities (joining Lindenwold, Pine Hill, Pine Valley and Somerdale) created on that same date. The borough's name is traditionally said to derive from a Native American term meaning \"high rolling knoll\" or \"high ground\", though it may have been named for Nella, the wife of Lucious Parker, who developed Hi-Nella Estates in the late 1920s.\nThe Star-Ledger included Hi-Nella in its 2010 series of articles covering \"Towns that Shouldn't Exist\", citing the borough's small area, population and staff, along with its use of a double-wide trailer as a municipal building. Mayor Meredith Dobbs told The Star-Ledger that efforts to force the borough to consolidate with its neighbors would be \"declared dead on arrival\".\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Hi-Nella borough had a total area of 0.231 square miles (0.597 km2), all of which was land.\nHi-Nella borders the Camden County municipalities of Gloucester Township, Somerdale and Stratford.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Census 2010 ===\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, there were 870 people, 377 households, and 216 families residing in the borough. The population density was 3,773.3 per square mile (1,456.9/km2). There were 420 housing units at an average density of 1,821.6 per square mile (703.3/km2).

The governing body consists of a Mayor and a Borough Council comprising six council members, with all positions elected at-large on a non-partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with three seats coming up for election in odd-numbered years in a four-year cycle. The Borough form of government used by Hi-Nella, the most common system used in the state, is a \"weak mayor / strong council\" government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.\nAs of 2016, the mayor of Hi-Nella is Democrat Meredith Dobbs, whose term of office ends December 31, 2019. Members of the Borough Council are Brian Cunningham (2017), Cindy McCoy (2017), John Schaeffer (2017), Michael Segeren (2015) and Harry Uber (2017).\n\n\n=== Federal, state and county representation ===\nHi-Nella is located in the 1st Congressional District and is part of New Jersey's 6th state legislative district. Prior to the 2011 reapportionment following the 2010 Census, Hi-Nella had been in the 5th state legislative district.\nNew Jersey's First Congressional District is represented by Donald Norcross (D, Camden). New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2021) and Bob Menendez (Paramus, 2019).\nFor the 2018\u20132019 session (Senate, General Assembly), the 6th Legislative District of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by James Beach (D, Voorhees Township) and in the General Assembly by Louis Greenwald (D, Voorhees Township) and Pamela Rosen Lampitt (D, Cherry Hill). The Governor of New Jersey is Phil Murphy (D, Middletown Township). The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is Sheila Oliver (D, East Orange).\nCamden County is governed by a Board of Chosen Freeholders, whose seven members chosen at-large in partisan elections to three-year terms office on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election each year. As of 2015, Camden County's Freeholders are Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli, Jr. (Collingswood, term as freeholder ends December 31, 2017; term as director ends 2015), Freeholder Deputy Director Edward T. McDonnell (Pennsauken Township, term as freeholder ends 2016; term as deputy director ends 2015), Michelle Gentek (Gloucester Township, 2015), Ian K. Leonard (Camden, 2015), Jeffrey L. Nash (Cherry Hill, 2015), Carmen Rodriguez (Merchantville, 2016) and Jonathan L. Young, Sr. (Berlin Township, November 2015; serving the unexpired term of Scot McCray ending in 2017)\nCamden County's constitutional officers, all elected directly by voters, are County clerk Joseph Ripa, Sheriff Charles H. Billingham, and Surrogate Patricia Egan Jones. The Camden County Prosecutor Mary Eva Colalillo was appointed by the Governor of New Jersey with the advice and consent of the New Jersey Senate (the upper house of the New Jersey Legislature).\n\n\n=== Politics ===\nAs of March 23, 2011, there were a total of 571 registered voters in Hi-Nella, of which 252 (44.1%) were registered as Democrats, 59 (10.3%) were registered as Republicans and 260 (45.5%) were registered as Unaffiliated. There were no voters registered to other parties.\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 66.1% of the vote (213 cast), ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 30.4% (98 votes), and other candidates with 3.4% (11 votes), among the 326 ballots cast by the borough's 645 registered voters (4 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 50.5%. In the 2008 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 67.5% of the vote (249 cast), ahead of Republican John McCain, who received around 29.3% (108 votes), with 369 ballots cast among the borough's 529 registered voters, for a turnout of 69.8%. In the 2004 presidential election, Democrat John Kerry received 61.9% of the vote (216 ballots cast), outpolling Republican George W. Bush, who received around 37.5% (131 votes), with 349 ballots cast among the borough's 497 registered voters, for a turnout percentage of 70.2.\nIn the 2013 gubernatorial election, Republican Chris Christie received 59.6% of the vote (99 cast), ahead of Democrat Barbara Buono with 36.7% (61 votes), and other candidates with 3.6% (6 votes), among the 171 ballots cast by the borough's 658 registered voters (5 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 26.0%. In the 2009 gubernatorial election, Republican Chris Christie received 46.6% of the vote (90 ballots cast), ahead of both Democrat Jon Corzine with 46.1% (89 votes) and Independent Chris Daggett with 4.1% (8 votes), with 193 ballots cast among the borough's 544 registered voters, yielding a 35.5% turnout.\n\n\n== Education ==\nHi-Nella is a non-operating school district. For pre-kindergarten through eighth grade, public school students from Hi-Nella attend school in Stratford as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Stratford School District that has been phased in over a five-year period starting in 2012-13. As of the 2014-15 school year, the district and its two schools had an enrollment of 1,071 students and 71.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student\u2013teacher ratio of 15.0:1. Schools in the district (with 2014-15 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are Parkview Elementary School with 372 students in pre-kindergarten through third grade and Samuel S. Yellin Elementary School with 486 students in grades 4 - 8.\nPrior to that, Hi-Nella students in K-8 had previously attended the Oaklyn Public School District. With Hi-Nella ending its sending/receiving relationship under a phase-out that would see all Hi-Nella students out of Oaklyn's school by 2016-17, the Oaklyn district saw overall enrollment decline from 469 in 2011-12 to 384 in 2014-15, resulting in the loss of tuition revenue that had accounted for as much as 10% of Oaklyn's budget, causing significant strain on the district's budget.\nFor ninth grade through twelfth grade, public school students attend Sterling High School, a regional high school district that serves students from Magnolia, Somerdale and Stratford, along with the sending districts of Hi-Nella and Laurel Springs. The high school is located in Somerdale. As of the 2014-15 school year, the high school had an enrollment of 961 students and 71.5 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student\u2013teacher ratio of 13.4:1.\nPrior to the establishment of this agreement with Sterling in 2012, Hi-Nella students attended Collingswood High School, which is much further away from Hi-Nella.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nAs of May 2010, the borough had a total of 3.18 miles (5.12 km) of roadways, of which 2.32 miles (3.73 km) were maintained by the municipality and 0.86 miles (1.38 km) by Camden County.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBorough website\nOaklyn Public Schools\nOaklyn Public Schools's 2015\u201316 School Report Card from the New Jersey Department of Education\nSchool Data for the Oaklyn Public Schools, National Center for Education Statistics\nSterling High School\nSterling High School's 2015\u201316 School Performance Report from the New Jersey Department of Education",

It is located at the district of Shwak, in the eastern province of Paktia. It belongs to Shabak Khel tribe, one of the five major Zadran tribes.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Shabak Khel tribe is split into two sub-tribes: the Fath-e Khel and Sub Khel.\nFath-e Khel (Pat-e Khel) had three sons:\nMirwali\nJaburi\nLucchi\nSub Khel had three sons:\nPaio\nBui\nShamshiray\nPaio had seven sons, one of whom was named Nurkhun.\nNurkhun had six sons:\nGulakai\nMadaki\nMataki\nJanak\nBijun\nJun\nHun\nGulakai had four sons:\nShergol\nPirmamad (Pir Muhammad)\nNiermamad (Noor Muhammad)\nShalai\nShergol had four sons:\nShabaz Khan\nChargul Khan\nTaybghan Khan\nWakil Majan\nShabaz Khan had three sons:\nNurbaz Khan\nJanbaz Khan\nHaji Zaher Khan\nChargul Khan had two sons:\nGulabaz Khan\nWazirbaz Khan\nTaybghan Khan had three sons:\nAsil Khan\nNizirban Khan\nJanagol Khan\nWakil Majan had three sons:\nDawud Jan Paktiawal\nHaji Amin Jan Paktiawal\nHaji Hakim Jan Paktiawal\n\n\n== Tribal leaders of Gulakai Kot in Afghan history ==\nThe known tribal leaders of the village in the 21st century were also the first members of the Zadran tribe in the Afghan parliament between 1958 and 1973, during the reign of King Mohammed Sahir Schah. These two were Muhammad Jan (also called Majan Wakil) and Ir Mohammad (Irmahmad) Wakil.\nThey were not only representatives of the village and the Shabak Khel tribe but were also representatives of the entire tribe of Zadran from the eastern province of Afghanistan. They were participating in the parliament as tribal and national representatives from the province of Paktia.\n\n\n== Pakistan independence war ==\nThe people of Paktia province have not only fought in the independence wars of Afghanistan (Afghan-Anglo Wars), but they also fought in the independence of Pakistan, for which the first government of Pakistan granted the title of defenders of Freedom to the fighters from Paktia Province. The government of Pakistan also granted land and immunity in Pakistan to the fighters. Among those freedom fighters were two famous and known commanders from the village of Gulakai Kot who were named Chargol Khan and Pate Jang who led the Afghan guerillas who were participating in the fight for the independence of Pakistan. After Pakistan was liberated, they returned home.\n\n\n== Chargol Khan and Pate Jang from Gulakai Kot ==\nChargol Khan had four brothers. One of them was Muhammad Jan (Majan) Wakil who was one of the two commanders of the guerillas. The second commander was Pate Jang in the fight for independence of Pakistan.\nAs a gift for their contribution and liberation of Pakistan, they were granted huge land, property and immunity from persecution in the new Pakistani nation state.\nThe tribes of Paktia choose them both to be their leaders in the guerrilla war against the Indian army. In the year 1948, they both were leading fierce tribal Afghans against the Indian army. After bloody fights, they pushed the Indian army back from where they were occupied in the Indian Subcontinent and captured large parts of Kashmir. Mirpur and Jatla were among them in fierce fighting against Sikhs and Indian troops in Bara Bura near Srinagar, Kashmir. Pate Jang was killed by the Indian army in battle.\n\n\n== Chargol Khan imprisoned in British-India ==\nIn the time when India was occupied by England, Chargol Khan was captured by the British Army and sent to prison.\nAs per folklore, there was a British commander in charge who said to Chargol Khan: \"You Afghans are known to be strong wrestler. If you beat one of my men, I will reduce a year in your jailterm but if you lose you will get five years in jail extra.\"\nThen Chargol Khan and a British sodier started wrestling and Chargol Khan defeated the soldier. As a result of his win against the British man, he was given a reward and reduce in his jailterm.\nAfter the defeat of the soldier, Chargol's colleagues were not only happy to defame the wrestlers of the British majesty, but he also won the hearts and minds of fellow prisoners.\nThe British commander was surprised by the strength of Chargol, so he said to him, \"In the mountain, there is a big snake. If you kill this snake, we shall reduce your prison term for another time.\"\nChargol Khan agreed with him and went to the mountains. They gave him an axe to defeat the snake. The people who were watching Chargol Khan were impressed, as how he killed the big snake, \"Anaconda\".He was awarded for his strength and once more his jail sentence was reduced.\nThe British Army asked him to come with them to the UK. Chargoal said, \"I can't come with you because i have left my family back, of whom i have to take care of\".When he was in Khost, he met a good friend named Bubrak Khan and spent a few days with him. After this, he went back to his home (Gulakai Kot).\n\n\n== The people of the village ==\nShergol Kot (also called Gulakai) had had lots of famous fighters. Most people of this village fought not only against British-India but also are known for their ferocity against the Russian and Communist army in Afghanistan.\nIn many countries, like Germany, England, Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, there are quite a few people who emigrated from Shergol Kot to escape the wars.",

It is a Canadian version of NBA TV, broadcasting programming focused on the National Basketball Association, and its Canadian franchise, the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn December 2000, MLSE was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a Category 2 digital specialty channel license tentatively known as Raptors Basketball Channel, a channel described as being devoted primarily to the Toronto Raptors basketball franchise and the National Basketball Association (NBA), with additional programming related to other aspects of basketball.\nThe channel was launched on September 7, 2001 as Raptors NBA TV, with programming focused on the NBA and other basketball-related programming, although it maintained a particular emphasis on the Toronto Raptors. On November 1, 2005, the network launched a high definition simulcast.\nOn October 15, 2010, the channel was renamed as NBA TV Canada, as the network began to air more programming devoted to the NBA and international basketball in general, sourced from its U.S. counterpart.\nThe channel was valued at $21 million on behalf of the CRTC in 2012.\n\n\n== Programming ==\nNBA TV Canada broadcasts programming primarily related to the NBA and the Raptors, as well as coverage of other leagues including the EuroLeague and the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). Regular hosts for local studio programming include David Amber, Sherman Hamilton, Matt Devlin, Leo Rautins and Jack Armstrong. The channel broadcasts NBA games sourced from NBA TV and ESPN, and other original programs from NBA TV.\nNBA TV Canada does not broadcast live Raptors games outside of the pre-season (which are split between the networks of TSN and Sportsnet\u2014which are owned by the co-majority owners of MLSE, Rogers Communications and Bell Canada), but does broadcast full and abbreviated encores of Raptors telecasts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

In its debut it was second to last in the North group and was scheduled to play the relegation play-off against SV L\u00f6chgau, but the tie was cancelled due to the withdrawal of Hamburger SV's farm team and both teams avoided relegation.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The LK201 was a detachable computer keyboard introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation of Maynard, Massachusetts in 1982. It was first used by Digital's VT220 ANSI/ASCII terminal and was subsequently used by the Rainbow-100, DECmate-II, and Pro-350 microcomputers and many of Digital's computer workstations such as the VAXstation and DECstation families.\n\nThe keyboard layout was new at the time, adding a set of cursor and miscellaneous keys between the main keyboard and the numeric keypad. The cursor keys were arranged in what has now become the standard \"Inverted T\" arrangement seen on essentially all contemporary full-sized computer keyboards. Ergonomic considerations caused the keyboard to be designed with a very low profile; it was very thin, especially when compared to the keyboard used on the VT100. The keyboard connected using a 4 position modular connector over which flowed 12 volt power and 4800 bit/s asynchronous serial data.\nThe keyboard also added a Compose key. This allowed the typing of all of the characters in the terminal's extended character set using two-stroke mnemonics to represent the characters. An umlaut, for example, \u00fc could be typed by pressing the following sequence:\nCompose\nu\n\" (double quote, mnemonically like the dots above the umlaut)\nAn LED on the keyboard indicated an ongoing compose sequence.\nAt the time of its introduction, the differences between the new layout and the traditional Teletype Model 33 and VT100 layouts proved disruptive, but the LK201's key arrangement has become the de facto standard for all full-sized computer keyboards, differing primarily in the fact that the Compose key has been removed, and that the numeric keypad shows two double-height keys instead of one, decreasing the number pad keys from 18 to 17.\nFollow-on keyboards from Digital refined the design introduced with the LK201. One notable departure from the basic LK201 design was a Unix-oriented keyboard, the LK421, that omitted the added middle group of cursor and miscellaneous function keys but included a dedicated Escape Key. Many Unix users preferred a narrower, ASCII-oriented keyboard rather than the rather-wide LK201 arrangement and the Escape Key was essential for several popular Unix editors.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBSD documentation on LK201 keyboard\nMore pictures of the LK201 including internals\nLK201 Keycode and Keyboard Division Chart (in color) (jpg 67k) (The scancode of Right Shift is xab, not xae which is (Left) Shift only (see the next reference).\nLK201 Keycodes and Keyboard Divisions",

These services provide transfers to AC Transit at Richmond Parkway Transit Center, shopping areas at Hilltop Mall Shopping Center and Pinole Vista Shopping Center and transbay service to the San Francisco Transbay Terminal.\nThe westbound weekday morning commute from this point south towards the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge is the most congested in the San Francisco Bay Area since 2001 according to Caltrans.\nStudies have been concluded as to the feasibility of running BART service to the Transit Center.\n\n\n== Bus service ==\nThe following bus services stop at the center:\n\n\n=== WestCAT ===\n10 Gems and Birds: Hercules\n11 Crockett/Rodeo: Crockett via Rodeo\n12 Trees and Flowers: Hercules\n15 Viewpointe: Rodeo\n19 Hilltop/Hercules: The Shops at Hilltop (Saturday service only)\n30Z Martinez Link: Martinez Station\nC3 Contra Costa College\nDial-a-ride General public dial-a-ride and paratransit service\nJ Hercules/BART: El Cerrito del Norte Station\nJPX Hercules/BART: El Cerrito del Norte Station via Pinole Valley Road\nJX Hercules/BART: El Cerrito del Norte Station Non-Stop Express\nLynx: San Francisco Transbay Terminal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap: 38\u00b000\u203246\u2033N 122\u00b015\u203255\u2033W\nTransit and parking information at Transit Unlimited\nParking permit sales",

            "content": "Constans II (Medieval Greek: \u039a\u03ce\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u0392', K\u014dnstas II; Latin: Heraclius Constantinus Augustus or Flavius Constantinus Augustus); 7 November 630 \u2013 15 September 668), also called Constantine the Bearded (\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u03a0\u03c9\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 K\u014dnstantinos ho Pogonatos), was emperor of the Byzantine Empire from 641 to 668. He was the last emperor to serve as consul, in 642. Constans is a diminutive nickname given to the Emperor, who had been baptized Herakleios and reigned officially as Constantine. The nickname established itself in Byzantine texts and has become standard in modern historiography.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life and reign as co-emperor ===\nConstans was the son of Constantine III and Gregoria. Due to the rumours that Heraklonas and Martina had poisoned Constantine III, he was named co-emperor in 641. Later that same year his uncle was deposed, and Constans II was left as sole emperor.\nConstans owed his rise to the throne to a popular reaction against his uncle and to the protection of the soldiers led by the general Valentinus. Although the precocious emperor addressed the senate with a speech blaming Heraklonas and Martina for eliminating his father, he reigned under a regency of senators led by Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople. In 644 Valentinus attempted to seize power for himself but failed.\n\n\n=== As sole emperor ===\nUnder Constans, the Byzantines completely withdrew from Egypt in 642, and Caliph Uthman launched numerous attacks on the islands of the Mediterranean Sea and Aegean Sea. A Byzantine fleet under the admiral Manuel occupied Alexandria again in 645, but after a Muslim victory the following year this had to be abandoned. The situation was complicated by the violent opposition to Monothelitism by the clergy in the west and the related rebellion of the Exarch of Carthage, Gregory the Patrician. The latter fell in battle against the army of Caliph Uthman, and the region remained a vassal state under the Caliphate until civil war broke out and imperial rule was again restored.\n\nConstans attempted to steer a middle line in the church dispute between Orthodoxy and Monothelitism by refusing to persecute either and prohibiting further discussion of the natures of Jesus Christ by decree in 648. Naturally, this live-and-let-live compromise satisfied few passionate participants in the dispute.\nMeanwhile, the advance of the Caliphate continued unabated. In 647 they had entered Armenia and Cappadocia and sacked Caesarea Mazaca. In the same year, they raided Africa and killed Gregory. In 648 the Arabs raided into Phrygia, and in 649 they launched their first maritime expedition against Crete. A major Arab offensive into Cilicia and Isauria in 650\u2013651 forced the Emperor to enter into negotiations with Caliph Uthman's governor of Syria, Muawiyah. The truce that followed allowed a short respite and made it possible for Constans to hold on to the western portions of Armenia.\nIn 654, however, Muawiyah renewed his raids by sea, plundering Rhodes. Constans led a fleet to attack the Muslims at Phoinike (off Lycia) in 655 at the Battle of the Masts, but he was defeated: 500 Byzantine ships were destroyed in the battle, and the Emperor himself was almost killed. Before the battle, chronicler Theophanes the Confessor says, the Emperor dreamed of being at Thessalonika; this dream predicted his defeat against the Arabs because the word Thessalonika is similar to the sentence \"thes allo niken\", which means \"gave victory to another (the enemy)\". Caliph Uthman was preparing to attack Constantinople, but he did not carry out the plan when the first Fitna broke out in 656.\n\nIn 658, with the eastern frontier under less pressure, Constans defeated the Slavs in the Balkans, temporarily reasserting some notion of Byzantine rule over them and resettled some of them in Anatolia (ca. 649 or 667). In 659 he campaigned far to the east, taking advantage of a rebellion against the Caliphate in Media. The same year he concluded peace with the Arabs.\nNow Constans could turn to church matters once again. Pope Martin I had condemned both Monothelitism and Constans' attempt to halt debates over it (the Type of Constans) in the Lateran Council of 649. Now the Emperor ordered his Exarch of Ravenna to arrest the Pope. Exarch Olympius excused himself from this task, but his successor, Theodore I Calliopas, carried it out in 653. Pope Martin was brought to Constantinople and condemned as a criminal, ultimately being exiled to Cherson, where he died in 655.\nConstans grew increasingly fearful that his younger brother, Theodosius, could oust him from the throne; he therefore obliged Theodosius to take holy orders and later had him killed in 660. Constans' sons Constantine, Heraclius, and Tiberius had been associated on the throne since the 650s. However, having attracted the hatred of citizens of Constantinople, Constans decided to leave the capital and to move to Syracuse in Sicily.\nFrom there, in 663, he launched an assault against the Lombard Duchy of Benevento, which then encompassed most of Southern Italy. Taking advantage of the fact that Lombard king Grimoald I of Benevento was engaged against Frankish forces from Neustria, Constans disembarked at Taranto and besieged Lucera and Benevento. However, the latter resisted and Constans withdrew to Naples. During the journey from Benevento to Naples, Constans II was defeated by Mitolas, Count of Capua, near Pugna. Constans ordered Saburrus, the commander of his army, to attack again the Lombards, but he was defeated by the Beneventani at Forino, between Avellino and Salerno.\nIn 663 Constans visited Rome for twelve days\u2014the only emperor to set foot in Rome for two centuries\u2014and was received with great honor by Pope Vitalian (657\u2013672). Although on friendly terms with Vitalian, he stripped buildings, including the Pantheon, of their ornaments and bronze to be carried back to Constantinople, and in 666 declared the Pope of Rome to have no jurisdiction over the Archbishop of Ravenna, since that city was the seat of the exarch, his immediate representative. His subsequent moves in Calabria and Sardinia were marked by further strippings and request of tributes that enraged his Italian subjects.\nAccording to Warren Treadgold, the first themes were created between 659 and 661, during the reign of Constans II.\n\n\n=== Death and succession ===\nRumours that he was going to move the capital of the Empire to Syracuse were probably fatal for Constans. On September 15, 668, he was assassinated in his bath by his chamberlain, according to Theophilus of Edessa, with a bucket.\nHis son Constantine succeeded him as Constantine IV. A brief usurpation in Sicily by Mezezius was quickly suppressed by the new emperor.\n\n\n== Record in Chinese sources ==\n\nThe Chinese dynastic histories of the Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang mention several embassies made by Fu lin (\u62c2\u83fb), which they equated with Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). These are recorded as having begun in the year 643 with an embassy sent by the king Boduoli (\u6ce2\u591a\u529b, i.e. Constans II Pogonatos) to Emperor Taizong of Tang, bearing gifts such as red glass and green gemstones. Other contacts are reported taking place in 667, 701, and perhaps 719, sometimes through Central Asian intermediaries. These histories also record that the Arabs (Da shi \u5927\u98df) sent their commander \"Mo-yi\" (Chinese: \u6469\u62fd\u4f10\u4e4b, Pinyin: M\u00f3 zhu\u0101i f\u00e1 zh\u012b), to besiege the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and forced the Byzantines to pay them tribute. This Arab commander \"Mo-yi\" was identified by historian Friedrich Hirth as Muawiyah I (r. 661-680), the governor of Syria before becoming the Umayyad caliph. The same books also described Constantinople in some detail as having massive granite walls and a water clock mounted with a golden statue of man. The Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta, writing during the reign of Heraclius (r. 610\u2013641), relayed information about China's geography, its capital city Khubdan (Old Turkic: Khumdan, i.e. Chang'an), its current ruler Taisson whose name meant \"Son of God\" (Chinese: Tianzi, although this could be derived from the name of Emperor Taizong of Tang), and correctly pointed to its reunification by the Sui Dynasty (581-618) as occurring during the reign of Maurice, noting that China had previously been divided politically along the Yangzi River by two warring nations.\n\n\n== Family ==\nBy his wife Fausta, a daughter of the patrician Valentinus, Constans II had three sons:\nConstantine IV, who succeeded him as Emperor\nHeraclius, co-emperor from 659 to 681\nTiberius, co-emperor from 659 to 681\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Byzantine emperors\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nOstrogorsky, George (1956).

            "content": "The Soviet occupation of Romania refers to the period from 1944 to August 1958, during which the Soviet Union maintained a significant military presence in Romania. The fate of the territories held by Romania after 1918 that were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 is treated separately in the article on Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.\nDuring the Eastern Front offensive of 1944, the Soviet Army occupied what had been the Kingdom of Romania prior to the military occupation. The northwestern part of Moldavia was occupied as a result of armed combat that took place between the months of April and August of that year, while Romania was still an ally of Nazi Germany. The rest of the territory was occupied after Romania changed sides in World War II, as a result of the royal coup launched by King Michael on August 23, 1944. On that date, the King announced that Romania had unilaterally ceased all military actions against the Allied forces, accepted the Allied armistice offer, and joined the war against the Axis Powers. As no formal armistice offer had been extended yet, the Red Army occupied most of Romania as enemy territory prior to the signing of the Moscow Armistice of September 12, 1944.\nThe armistice convention and eventually the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 provided a legal basis for the Soviet military presence in Romania, which lasted until 1958, reaching a peak of some 615,000 in 1946.\nSoviet authors and the 1952 Constitution of Romania referred to the events of 1944 as the \"liberation of Romania by the glorious Soviet Army\". On the other hand, most Romanian and Western sources use the term \"Soviet occupation of Romania,\" some applying it to the whole period from 1944 to 1958.\n\n\n== Background and beginning of the occupation ==\n\nAfter having withdrawn its troops from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in response to the June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum, Romania entered an alliance with Nazi Germany and declared war on the Soviet Union. Romanian troops entered World War II in 1941 as part of Operation Barbarossa, under the German High Command. Following the recapturing of the territory annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, Romanian troops occupied Southern Ukraine all the way to the Southern Bug. However, Romania's eastern campaign ended in disaster, notably at Stalingrad.\nBy the end of 1943, the Red Army had regained control over most of the Soviet territory, and was advancing westward beyond the borders of USSR to defeat Nazi Germany and its allies. It was in this context that the Soviet forces crossed into Romania and occupied Northern and Eastern Moldavia.\nOn August 23, 1944 King Michael launched a coup d'\u00e9tat, thereby overthrowing the pro-Nazi government of Ion Antonescu, and putting Romania's Army on the side of the Allies. As a result, King Michael was the last monarch behind the Iron Curtain to lose his throne, on December 30, 1947.\nThe coup facilitated the advance of the Red Army into Romania at an accelerated pace, and enabled the combined Romanian and Soviet armies to liberate the country from the German occupation. In the absence of an actual signed armistice, the Soviet troops continued to treat the Romanians as a hostile force. The armistice was signed three weeks later, on September 12, 1944, \"on terms Moscow virtually dictated.\" The coup effectively amounted to a \"capitulation\", an \"unconditional\" \"surrender\" to the Soviets and the rest of the Allies. In the wake of the cease fire order given by King Michael, between 114,000 and 160,000 Romanian soldiers were taken prisoners of war by the Soviets without resisting, and they were forced to march to remote detention camps, located in the Soviet Union; according to survivors interviewed in a 2004 documentary, up to a third of the prisoners perished on the way.\nBy September 12, the Red Army had already gained control over much of the Romanian territory. Under the terms of its Armistice Agreement with the Allies, Romania became subject to an Allied Control Commission, composed of representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, while the Soviet military command exercised predominant, de facto authority. Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina were again incorporated into the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Founding documents ==\n\n\n=== The Armistice Agreement ===\nArticle 3 of the Armistice Agreement with Romania (signed in Moscow on September 12, 1944), stipulated that\n\n\"The Government and High Command of Rumania will ensure to the Soviet and other Allied forces facilities for free movement on Rumanian territory in any direction if required by the military situation, the Rumanian Government and High Command of Rumania giving such movement every possible assistance with their own means of communications and at their own expense on land, on water and in the air.\"\n\nArticle 18 of the same agreement stipulated that\n\n\"An Allied Control Commission will be established which will undertake until the conclusion of peace the regulation of and control over the execution of the present terms under the general direction and orders of the Allied (Soviet) High Command, acting on behalf of the Allied Powers. In the Annex to Article 18, it was made clear that \"The Rumanian Government and their organs shall fulfill all instructions of the Allied Control Commission arising out of the Armistice Agreement\", and that The Allied Control Commission would have its seat in Bucharest.\n\nIn line with Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, two People's Tribunals were set up for the purpose of trying suspected war criminals, one in Bucharest, and the other in Cluj.\nThe plenipotentiary signatories to the armistice as indicated therein were:\nAllied powers: \"representative of the Allied (Soviet) High Command, Marshal of the Soviet Union, R. Y. Malinovski, duly authorized hereto by the Governments of the United States of America; the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom.\"\nRomania: \"Minister of State and Minister of Justice L. Patrascanu, Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, Adjutant of His Majesty the King of Rumania General D. Damaceanu, Prince Stirbey, and Mr. G. Popp.\"\n\n\n=== Paris Peace Treaties, 1947 ===\n\nThe effect of the Armistice Agreement ceased on September 15, 1947, when the Paris Peace Treaty with Romania entered into force. Article 21, paragraph 1 of the new treaty provided the legal foundation for continued and unlimited Soviet military presence in Romania:\n\nUpon the coming into force of the present Treaty, all Allied Forces shall, within a period of 90 days, be withdrawn from Roumania, subject to the right of the Soviet Union to keep on Roumanian territory such armed forces as it may need for the maintenance of the lines of communication of the Soviet Army with the Soviet zone of occupation in Austria.\n\nThe Romanian delegation at the Paris Conference was headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu. The Peace Treaty with Romania was signed on February 10, 1947, in the Salon de l'Horloge of the Minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00c9trang\u00e8res. On the Romanian side, the four signatories were Gheorghe T\u0103t\u0103rescu, Lucre\u021biu P\u0103tr\u0103\u0219canu, \u0218tefan Voitec, and Dumitru D\u0103m\u0103ceanu. The signatories for the Allied powers included United States Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, and British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Ernest Bevin.\n\n\n== Soviet forces in Romania, 1944\u20131956 ==\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Armistice Agreement in 1944, Soviet troops occupied the entire territory of Romania. Estimates of troop levels vary between 750,000 and 1 million (estimates of British military officials), to between 1 and 1.5 million (estimates of the Romanian General Staff); many Western diplomats and experts refer to more than 1 million Soviet troops.\nOn November 8, 1945, King Michael's name day, an anti-communist demonstration in front of the Royal Palace in Bucharest was met with force, resulting in dozens of casualties. Soviet officers restrained Romanian soldiers and police from firing on civilians, and Soviet troops restored order.\nThe estimated strength of Soviet forces stationed in Romania (including air, navy, ground, and security troops), from VE Day to 1952, is shown in the table on the right.\nDuring the second half of 1946, more than half of the combat capabilities of the Soviet Air Forces were residing outside the USSR, with the largest portion in Poland and Romania (2,500 planes in each country). The troop levels surged to a high of 615,000 in March 1946, but they were drawn down after the conclusion of the Peace Treaty in 1947. By the end of 1946, Soviet units in Romania were concentrated in five areas: Craiova\u2013Slatina, Sibiu\u2013Alba-Iulia, Constan\u021ba, and Br\u0103ila\u2013Foc\u0219ani. Troop levels reach a relatively stable level from May 1948 until October 1956: two full divisions, plus supporting units adding up to roughly a third division.\nAlthough with the signing of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955 the reason for the presence of Soviet troops as stated in the Paris Peace Treaties ceased to exist, Premier Gheorghiu-Dej announced that these troops would stay as long as foreign soldiers continue to be stationed in West Germany.\nSoviet troops stationed in Romania participated in the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of November 1956. Soviet troop facilities inside Romania were off limits to all Romanians at the time.\n\n\n== Reorganization of the Romanian Army ==\nThe Soviet occupation of Romania led to a complete reorganization of the Romanian Army under the supervision of Soviet Army representatives. The manpower of the Romanian army was limited by the Paris peace treaty to a total of 138,000 (officers and troops); however, under the Soviet occupation it grew far beyond the limits imposed by the treaty, through increasing militarization of Romania's population. By 1953, regular army forces had grown to approximately 300,000; reserve army forces to approximately 135,000; and \"interior\" forces (border guards, security brigades, et al.) under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior to over 325,000.\nAt the inception of this organizational overhaul, pro-German elements were purged from the Romanian armed forces. In 1944\u201345, two divisions composed of Romanian volunteers\u2014 former prisoners of war, trained in the Soviet Union during the war, and also Communist activists such as Valter Roman\u2014 were formed: the Tudor Vladimirescu Division, under the command of Colonel Nicolae Cambrea, and the Horia, Clo\u015fca \u015fi Cri\u015fan Division, under the command of General Mihail Lasc\u0103r (who was to serve as Minister of Defense from 1946 to 1947). These two units were to form the nucleus of the new Romanian Army under Soviet control. Once the Romanian Communist Party took the reins of power, 30% of officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, but at the same time a potential source of opposition to the Sovietization of the Army) were purged from the military.\nFollowing the Romanian Workers' Party seizure of political power, the Sovietization of the Romanian army went into full gear, under the supervision of the new Minister of Defense, Emil Bodn\u0103ra\u015f. This reorganization involved the adoption of the Soviet model of military and political organization, and a change of the military doctrine of combat and defense, in the context of Romania's integration into the Soviet strategic system, at the dawn of the Cold War.\nSoviet officers were appointed as advisers charged with supervising the thorough reorganization of the army. They held leadership and surveillance positions in the main institutions of the state, but also in areas of lesser importance. In the beginning, they only held a few positions in the Ministry of Defense, the General Staff, and the political sections inside the army. With the passage of time, the number of Soviet advisers gradually increased, while at the same time their positions became permanent. In November 1952, there were 105 permanent and 17 temporary Soviet adviser positions in military schools. After 1955, their number began to decrease: 72 in 1955, 63 in 1956, 25 in 1957 and 10 in 1958.\nAfter 1945, new military regulations were developed, following the templates of the Red Army, and they were finalized in 1949\u20131952. Consequently, a number of officers and military students were sent to the Soviet Union to complete their training. Between 1949 and 1952, 717 Romanian students were being trained in the USSR, while in 1958 471 Romanian military students were pursuing education in the USSR. Their number decreased in the following years.\n\n\n== Reorganization of the security services ==\n\nImmediately following the August 23, 1944 events, communists began to infiltrate the Ministry of Internal Affairs on a large scale. The General Directorate of the Security of the People (Romanian initials: DGSP, but more commonly just called the Securitate) was officially founded on August 30, 1948 by Decree 221/30. The Securitate was set up by SMERSH, an NKVD unit charged with dismantling the existing intelligence agencies and replacing them with Soviet-style bodies in the Soviet-occupied countries of Eastern Europe. The SMERSH unit in Romania, called Brigada Mobil\u0103, was led until 1948 by the former NKVD operative Alexandru Nicolschi. Its stated purpose was to \"defend democratic conquests and guarantee the safety of the Romanian Peoples' Republic against both internal and external enemies.\" The first Director of the Securitate was Soviet intelligence operative Gheorghe Pintilie. Alexandru Nicolschi (by then a general) and another Soviet officer, Major General Vladimir Mazuru, held the two deputy director positions.\n\n\n== Expulsion of Germans ==\n\nThe Red Army took part in the expulsion of up to 70,000 Transylvanian Saxons from Romania that was initiated in January 1945. In October 1944, the S\u0103n\u0103tescu government, at the request of the Allied Control Commission, began arresting young Romanian citizens of German descent, who were eventually placed at the disposal of the Soviet command. At the request of the Allied Commission, the R\u0103descu government ordered the forced transportation by train of Transylvanian Saxons to the Soviet Union. In a protest dated January 13, 1945, the R\u0103descu government affirmed the Romanian government's duty to protect each of its citizens, regardless of ethnic origin, and noted the absence of a legal basis for the deportation of the Transylvanian Saxons. The expellees were gradually allowed to return to Romania between late 1945 and 1949, though it is estimated that up to 10,000 perished during the expulsion or while in the Soviet Union. Such deportations would be outlawed in 1949 by the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\n\n== SovRoms ==\n\nThe SovRoms were Soviet-Romanian joint ventures established on Romanian territory at the end of World War II, and lasting until 1954\u20131956. An agreement between the two countries regarding the establishment of these enterprises was signed in Moscow on May 8, 1945. In theory, the purpose of these ventures was to generate funding for post-war reconstruction efforts. However, their real purpose was to provide resources for the Soviet side. Generally, they were a contributing factor to the draining of Romania's resources, in addition to the war reparations demanded by the Armistice Agreement and the Paris Peace Treaties, which had been initially set at 300 million U.S. dollars. The Soviet contribution to the creation of the SovRoms consisted mostly in reselling leftover German equipment to Romania, at systematically overvalued prices. The total value of goods sent from Romania to the Soviet Union was estimated at 2 billion dollars, exceeding by far the amount of war reparations demanded by the Soviets. By 1952, 85% of Romanian exports were directed towards the Soviet Union. The last Sovrom was dissolved in 1956.\nOne of these companies was Sovromcuar\u0163, which started its operations in 1950 at the B\u0103i\u0163a mine in Bihor County, under a name that was meant to conceal the true object of its activity. Its initial workforce consisted of 15,000 political prisoners; after most of them died of radiation poisoning, they were replaced by local villagers, who were completely unaware of the fact that they were working with radioactive material. Romania secretly  delivered 17,288 tons of uranium ore to the Soviet Union between 1952 and 1960, which was used, at least in part, in the Soviet atomic bomb project. Uranium mining continued there until 1961. All ore was shipped abroad for processing, initially to Sillam\u00e4e in Estonia; the uranium concentrate was then used exclusively by the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Comparison with Soviet occupation of other Eastern Bloc countries ==\nComparing the Soviet occupation of Romania to that of Bulgaria, David Stone notes: \"Unlike Bulgaria, Romania had few cultural and historical ties with Russia, and had actually waged war on the Soviet Union. As a result, Soviet occupation weighted heavier on the Romanian people, and the troops themselves were less disciplined.\"\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nDavai ceas, davai palton (eng.: give the wristwatch, give the overcoat). The well-known Romanian stage actor Constantin T\u0103nase was performing in Bucharest a year after the arrival of Soviet troops. He used to satirize the soldiers' habit of \"requisitioning\" all personal property in sight (in particular, wristwatches and coats), demanding them by saying, \"Davai ceas, davai palton\". There are differing accounts of his demise, in August 1945, but one of them states that he was found dead two days after one of his satirical acts.\nThe writer Mihail Sebastian was among the eyewitnesses to the events of 1944. In his diary (Journal, 1935-1944: The Fascist Years), he described the atmosphere in Bucharest at the time, as follows: \"Bewilderment, fear, doubt. Russian soldiers rape women (as Dina Cocea was saying yesterday). Soldiers stop cars, let the driver and passengers out, get behind the wheel, and take off. Stores looted. This afternoon, at Zaharia, three of them broke in the safe, taking watches. (The watch is the toy they like the best.)\" Sebastian died in a tram accident just weeks after the Soviet Army occupied Romania. His Journal has recently gained a new audience in the West. In 2004, American playwright David Auburn wrote a one-man play, entitled The Journals of Mihail Sebastian; it made its debut the same year in New York City, starring actor Stephen Kunken in the role of Sebastian.\nThe 25th Hour. Virgil Gheorghiu's best-known book depicts the plight of a young farmhand, Johann Moritz, under German and Soviet occupation. Johann is sent to a labor camp by a police captain who covets his wife, Suzanna. At first, he is tagged as a Jew. Later, he is \"rescued\" by a Nazi officer, who forces him into service as a model for German propaganda. Imprisoned after the war, he is severely beaten by his Russian captors, then put on trial by Allied forces because of his work for the Nazis. In 1967, Carlo Ponti produced a film based on this book; directed by Henri Verneuil, it featured Anthony Quinn as Johann and Virna Lisi as Suzanna.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRomania during World War II\nRomanian anti-communist resistance movement\nSouthern Group of Forces\nSoviet occupations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nRomania - History \"[From The Library of Congress]: This text comes from the Country Studies Program, formerly the [American] Army Area Handbook Program.

            "content": "A photobioreactor is a bioreactor that utilizes a light source to cultivate phototrophic microorganisms. These organisms use photosynthesis to generate biomass from light and carbon dioxide and include plants, mosses, macroalgae, microalgae, cyanobacteria and purple bacteria. Within the artificial environment of a photobioreactor, specific conditions are carefully controlled for respective species. Thus, a photobioreactor allows much higher growth rates and purity levels than anywhere in nature or habitats similar to nature. Hypothetically, phototropic biomass could be derived from nutrient-rich wastewater and flue gas carbon dioxide in a photobioreactor.\n\n\n== Open systems ==\nThe first approach for the controlled production of phototrophic organisms was and still is a natural open pond or artificial raceway pond. Therein, the culture suspension, which contains all necessary nutrients and carbon dioxide, is pumped around in a cycle, being directly illuminated from sunlight via the liquid\u2019s surface. This construction principle is the simplest way of production for phototrophic organisms. But due to their depth (up to 0.3 m) and the related reduced average light supply, open systems only reach limited areal productivity rates. In addition, the consumption of energy is relatively high, as high amounts of water containing low product concentration have to be processed. Open space is expensive in areas with a dense population, while water is rare in others. Using open technologies causes high losses of water due to evaporation into the atmosphere.\n\n\n== Closed systems ==\nSince the 1950s several approaches have been conducted to develop closed systems, which theoretically provide higher cell densities of phototrophic organisms and therefore a lower demand of water to be pumped than open systems. In addition, closed construction avoids system-related water losses and the risk of contamination through landing water birds or dust is minimized. All modern photobioreactors have tried to balance between a thin layer of culture suspension, optimized light application, low pumping energy consumption, capital expenditure and microbial purity. Many different systems have been tested, but only a few approaches were able to perform at an industrial scale.\n\n\n=== Redesigned laboratory fermenters ===\nThe simplest approach is the redesign of the well-known glass fermenters, which are state of the art in many biotechnological research and production facilities worldwide. The moss reactor for example shows a standard glass vessel, which is externally supplied with light. The existing head nozzles are used for sensor installation and for gas exchange. This type is quite common in laboratory scale, but it has never been established in bigger scale, due to its limited vessel size.\n\n\n=== Tubular photobioreactors ===\n\nMade from glass or plastic tubes, this photobioreactor type has succeeded within production scale. The tubes are oriented horizontally or vertically and are supplied from a central utilities installation with pump, sensors, nutrients and CO2. Tubular photobioreactors are established worldwide from laboratory up to production scale, e.g. for the production of the carotenoid Astaxanthine from the green algae Haematococcus pluvialis or for the production of food supplement from the green algae Chlorella vulgaris. These photobioreactors take advantage from the high purity levels and their efficient outputs. The biomass production can be done at a high quality level and the high biomass concentration at the end of the production allows energy efficient downstream processing. Due to the recent prices of the photobioreactors, economically feasible concepts today can only be found within high-value markets, e.g. food supplement or cosmetics.\nThe advantages of tubular photobioreactors at production scale are also transferred to laboratory scale. A combination of the mentioned glass vessel with a thin tube coil allows relevant biomass production rates a laboratory research scale. Being controlled by a complex process control system the regulation of the environmental conditions reaches a high level.\n\n\n=== Christmas tree photobioreactor ===\n\nAn alternative approach is shown by a photobioreactor, which is built in a tapered geometry and which carries a helically attached, translucent double hose circuit system. The result is a layout similar to a Christmas tree. The tubular system is constructed in modules and can theoretically be scaled outdoors up to agricultural scale. A dedicated location is not crucial, similar to other closed systems, and therefore non-arable land is suitable as well. The material choice should prevent biofouling and ensure high final biomass concentrations. The combination of turbulence and the closed concept should allow a clean operation and a high operational availability.\n\n\n=== Plate photobioreactor ===\n\nAnother development approach can be seen with the construction based on plastic or glass plates. Plates with different technical design are mounted to form a small layer of culture suspension, which provides an optimized light supply. In addition, the simpler construction compared to tubular reactors allows the use of less expensive plastic materials. From the pool of different concepts e.g. meandering flow designs or bottom gassed systems have been realized and shown good output results. Some unsolved issues are material life time stability or the biofilm forming. Applications at industrial scale are limited by the scalability of plate systems.\nIn April 2013, the IBA in Hamburg, Germany, a building with an integrated glass plate photobioreactor facade, was commissioned.\n\n\n=== Horizontal photobioreactor ===\n\nThis photobioreactor type consists of a plate-shaped basic geometry with peaks and valleys arranged in regular distance. This geometry causes the distribution of incident light over a larger surface which corresponds to a dilution effect. This also helps solving a basic problem in phototrophic cultivation, because most microalgae species react sensitively to high light intensities. Most microalgae experience light saturation already at light intensities, ranging substantially below the maximum daylight intensity of approximately 2000 W/m2. Simultaneously, a larger light quantity can be exploited in order to improve photoconversion efficiency. The mixing is accomplished by a rotary pump, which causes a cylindrical rotation of the culture broth. In contrast to vertical designs, horizontal reactors contain only thin layers of media with a correspondingly low hydrodynamic pressure. This has a positive impact on the necessary energy input and reduces material costs at the same time.\n\n\n=== Foil photobioreactor ===\nThe pressure of market prices has led the development of foil-based photobioreactor types. Inexpensive PVC or PE foils are mounted to form bags or vessels which cover algae suspensions and expose them to light. The pricing ranges of photobioreactor types have been enlarged with the foil systems. It has to be kept in mind, that these systems have a limited sustainability as the foils have to be replaced from time to time. For full balances, the investment for required support systems has to be calculated as well.\n\n\n=== Porous Substrate Bioreactor ===\nPorous Substrate Bioreactor (PSBR), being developed at University of Cologne, also known as the twin-layer system, uses a new principle to separate the algae from a nutrient solution by means of a porous reactor surface on which the microalgae are trapped in biofilms. This new procedure reduces by a factor of up to one hundred the amount of liquid needed for operation compared to the current technology, which cultivates algae in suspensions. As such, the PSBR procedure significantly reduces the energy needed while increasing the portfolio of algae that can be cultivated.\n\n\n== Outlook ==\nThe discussion around microalgae and their potentials in carbon dioxide sequestration and biofuel production has caused high pressure on developers and manufacturers of photobioreactors. Today, none of the mentioned systems is able to produce phototrophic microalgae biomass at a price which is able to compete with crude oil. New approaches test e.g. dripping methods to produce ultra-thin layers for maximal growth with application of flue gas and waste water. Further on, much research is done worldwide on genetically modified and optimized microalgae.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlgaculture\nPhytoplankton\nAlgae fuel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBioreactors",

            "content": "Reformists and Democrats (Riformisti e Democratici, ReD) was a predominantly social-democratic faction within the Democratic Party (PD), a political party in Italy. Its most notable member was Massimo D'Alema.\nIt was founded in June 2004 as an association of more than 100 MPs close to the Fondazione ItalianiEuropei, a think tank led by D'Alema, and was mainly composed of long-time Dalemiani, such as Pier Luigi Bersani, Nicola Latorre, Marco Minniti, Barbara Pollastrini and Michele Ventura. Also some Lettiani, including Paolo De Castro and Francesco Boccia, and some Populars, including Nicodemo Oliverio and Lino Duilio (former president of Popular Italy), joined the group. De Castro was president, Duilio vice president and Ventura coordinator.\nReD, which proposed a structured model of party and its entry in the Party of European Socialists, had been increasingly critical of Walter Veltroni when secretary, so that in the 2009 Democratic Party leadership election most of its leading members supported the leadership bid of Pier Luigi Bersani, who was elected as the new party secretary.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nPresident: Paolo De Castro\nVice President: Lino Duilio\nCoordinator: Michele Ventura\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Some of the songs don't have a lot of space in them and the album doesn't have a whole lot of room to breathe, but I think in the case of an EP this is a really good thing\".\nThe band released their first LP, Elephant Shell, via their new label Saddle Creek on April 22, 2008 in North America, and May 5, 2008 in the U.K. and Continental Europe via Memphis Industries.

            "content": "The Magician is an American television series that ran during the 1973\u20131974 season. It starred Bill Bixby as stage illusionist Anthony \"Tony\" Blake, a playboy philanthropist who used his skills to solve difficult crimes as needed. In the series pilot, the character was named Anthony Dorian; the name was changed due to a conflict with the name of a real life stage magician.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nBlake was a professional stage magician who used his skills to solve crimes and help the helpless. Years earlier, Blake had been in prison on a trumped-up espionage charge in an unnamed country in South America. He discovered a way to escape with his cellmate, which began his interest in escapology. The cellmate died and left him a fortune. The escape, presumably followed by exoneration of the false charges that had led to it, led to Blake's pursuit of a career in stage magic, which made him famous. He never forgot his unjust imprisonment, and it motivated him to seek justice for others.\nInitially, Blake used his Boeing 720 jetliner (named \"The Spirit\") as a base of operations; it was outfitted as a mobile residence (\"It's like any other mobile home, only faster.\") with live-in pilot Jerry Anderson (Jim Watkins). Blake drove a white Chevrolet Corvette with custom license plates (\"SPIRIT\") and, for its time, an exotic feature: a car phone. Blake frequently received assistance from acerbic columnist Max Pomeroy (Keene Curtis), and Max's brilliant, wheelchair-bound son Dennis (Todd Crespi). Midway through the program's run, the idea of the airplane was dropped and Blake took up residence in a posh apartment at The Magic Castle, a real club devoted to magic acts. At the same time, the supporting cast of the show was replaced with a new, single character, Dominick (Joseph Sirola), a somewhat comical sidekick. No explanation for the changes was given in the series. Jerry continued to make occasional minor appearances (and Watkins and Curtis retained places in the opening credits) and Tony recruited Jerry and Max together for one further case in the new format.\nSome episodes featured Larry Anderson (who later hosted Truth or Consequences and created the JawDroppers video magic course) as Blake's assistant.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nBill Bixby as Anthony Blake\nJulian Christopher as Jerry Anderson\nKeene Curtis as Max Pomeroy\nJoseph Sirola as Dominick\nCami Sebring as Kathy\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Magic on the program ===\nThe show is noteworthy in that Bixby, a keen amateur magician, insisted on doing all of the magic himself, without any trick photography, although it was not possible for this to be the case in the TV-movie/pilot. Many of the episodes of the regular series were preceded by an announcement that the magic tricks were accomplished without trick photography. He was instructed in these performances by the program's technical advisor, Mark Wilson, who was credited as \"magic consultant.\" Once the format changed to have the hero based in a magic club, Wilson could occasionally be seen on the stage there, as well. In addition to escapes, Bixby performed feats of sleight of hand, mentalism, and stage illusions. After the series' cancellation, Bixby went on to host a string of magic specials on NBC and a series, The Wonderful World of Magic, in first-run syndication.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nVisual Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 on August 25, 2017.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nThough it ran only a single season, The Magician was an influence on later series. The show was a favorite of The X-Files creator Chris Carter, who worked it into Special Agent Fox Mulder's \"origin\" story: a teenaged Mulder was waiting to watch The Magician when his sister Samantha was abducted by mysterious forces.\nIn the Quantum Leap episode \"The Great Spontini\", Scott Bakula's character, Dr. Sam Beckett, leaps into an amateur magician in 1974 who aspires to appear on Bill Bixby's The Magician; however, owing to his partial amnesia, Dr. Beckett, at first, can only recall Bixby's connection with The Incredible Hulk, which had not been made at that time.\nThe Incredible Hulk series featured an episode that paid homage to both The Magician and Bixby's earlier series, My Favorite Martian. In The Incredible Hulk's \"My Favorite Magician\" episode, Bixby's character became the temporary apprentice to a stage magician played by Bixby's Martian co-star, Ray Walston. Mark Wilson was on hand again as the episode's \"magic consultant\" as well. In addition, Martian co-star Pamela Britton appeared in an episode of The Magician.\nActor Andrew Robinson has stated that his Star Trek: Deep Space Nine character, Elim Garak, was partially influenced by Bixby's character.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBlake is but one in a long line of magicians who double as detectives. Others include:\nThe Great Merlini, created by author Clayton Rawson.\nNorgil the Magician, created by Walter B. Gibson.\nChandu the Magician, a radio series whose main character was played on screen by Edmund Lowe and Bela Lugosi.\nBlackstone, the Magic Detective, a 15-minute radio series based on the comic book series Blackstone, Master Magician.\nMandrake the Magician, a comic strip hero created by Lee Falk. Mandrake appeared in a 12 chapter serial for Columbia studios. A failed TV series pilot starred Anthony Herrera in the title role with Ji-Tu Cumbuka as Lothar. Unlike most crime-solving magicians, Mandrake is sometimes presented as having actual magical powers.\nAlexander Blacke, the hero of the 1986 television series Blacke's Magic, played by Hal Linden.\nJonathan Creek, starring Alan Davies, was a series produced by the BBC from 1997 to 2010. Creek was a designer of stage illusions who used his expertise to solve impossible crimes.\nNaoko Yamada, played by Yukie Nakama, the main character of the Japanese drama Trick.\nAce Cooper, the protagonist of the unrelated animated series, The Magician, which aired in the Fox Kids programming block between 1997 and 1998. Cooper was a stage magician in the future who solved crimes with his sidekick, Cosmo.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Magician on IMDb (series pilot)\nThe Magician on IMDb (TV series)\nThe Magician by Ed Robertson\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Gr\u00f8stl is a cryptographic hash function submitted to the NIST hash function competition by Praveen Gauravaram, Lars Knudsen, Krystian Matusiewicz, Florian Mendel, Christian Rechberger, Martin Schl\u00e4ffer, and S\u00f8ren S. Thomsen. Gr\u00f8stl was chosen as one of the five finalists of the competition. It uses the same S-box as AES in a custom construction. The authors claim speeds of up to 21.4 cycles per byte on an Intel Core 2 Duo.\nAccording to the submission document, the name \"Gr\u00f8stl\" is a multilingual play-on-words, referring to an Austrian dish that is very similar to hash (food).\nLike other hash functions in the MD5/SHA family, Gr\u00f8stl divides the input into blocks and iteratively computes hi = f(hi\u22121, mi). However, Gr\u00f8stl maintains a hash state at least twice the size of the final output (512 or 1024 bits), which is only truncated at the end of hash computation.\nThe compression function f is based on a pair of 256- or 512-bit permutation functions P and Q, and is defined as:\nf(h, m) = P(h \u2295 m) \u2295 Q(m) \u2295 h\nThe permutation functions P and Q are heavily based on the Rijndael (AES) block cipher, but operate on 8\u00d78 or 8\u00d716 arrays of bytes, rather than 4\u00d74. Like AES, each round consists of four operations:\nAddRoundKey (the Gr\u00f8stl round keys are fixed, but differ between P and Q)\nSubBytes (this uses the Rijndael S-box, allowing sharing with AES implementations)\nShiftBytes (expanded compared to AES, this also differs between P and Q, and 512- and 1024-bit versions)\nMixColumns (using an 8\u00d78 matrix rather than Rijndael's 4\u00d74)\nUnlike Rijndael, all rounds are identical and there is no final AddRoundKey operation. 10 rounds are recommended for the 512-bit permutation, and 14 rounds for the 1024-bit version.\nThe final double-width hash receives a final output transformation of\n\u03a9(h) = h \u2295 P(h)\nand is then truncated to the desired width. This is equivalent to applying a final iteration of the compression function using an all-zero message block m, followed by a (cryptographically insignificant) exclusive-or with the fixed constant Q(0).\n\n\n== Examples of Gr\u00f8stl hashes ==\nHash values of empty string.\n\nGr\u00f8stl-224(\"\")\n0x f2e180fb5947be964cd584e22e496242c6a329c577fc4ce8c36d34c3\nGr\u00f8stl-256(\"\")\n0x 1a52d11d550039be16107f9c58db9ebcc417f16f736adb2502567119f0083467\nGr\u00f8stl-384(\"\")\n0x ac353c1095ace21439251007862d6c62f829ddbe6de4f78e68d310a9205a736d8b11d99bffe448f57a1cfa2934f044a5\nGr\u00f8stl-512(\"\")\n0x 6d3ad29d279110eef3adbd66de2a0345a77baede1557f5d099fce0c03d6dc2ba8e6d4a6633dfbd66053c20faa87d1a11f39a7fbe4a6c2f009801370308fc4ad8\n\nEven a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a mostly different hash, due to the avalanche effect.

            "content": "A tide dial, also known as a mass or scratch dial, is a sundial marked with the canonical hours rather than or in addition to the standard hours of daylight. Such sundials were particularly common between the 7th and 14th centuries in Europe, at which point they began to be replaced by mechanical clocks. There are more than 3,000 surviving tide dials in England and at least 1,500 in France.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name tide dial preserves the Old English term t\u012bd, used for hours and canonical hours prior to the Norman Conquest of England, after which the Norman French hour gradually replaced it. The actual Old English name for sundials was d\u00e6gm\u00e6l or \"day-marker\".\n\n\n== History ==\n\nJews long recited prayers at fixed times of day. Psalm 119 in particular mentions praising God seven times a day, and the apostles Peter and John are mentioned attending afternoon prayers. Christian communities initially followed numerous local traditions with regard to prayer, but Charlemagne compelled his subjects to follow the Roman liturgy and his son Louis the Pious imposed the Rule of St Benedict upon their religious communities. The canonical hours adopted by Benedict and imposed by the Frankish kings were the Night Office (Nocturns) said in the wee hours, the Morning Office (Matins or Lauds) in the dawn just prior to sunrise, Prime after the 1st hour of sunlight, Terce at the 3rd, Sext at the 6th, Nones at the 9th, Vespers at sunset, and Compline after a period of rest and reading. Monks were called to these hours by their abbot or by the ringing of the church bell, with the time between services organized in reading the Bible or other religious texts, in manual labor, or in sleep.\nThe need for these monastic communities and others to organize their times of prayer prompted the establishment of tide dials built into the walls of churches. They began to be used in England in the late 7th century and spread from there across continental Europe through copies of Bede's works and by the Saxon and Hiberno-Scottish missions. Within England, tide dials fell out of favor after the Norman Conquest. By the 13th century, some tide dials\u2014like that at Strasbourg Cathedral\u2014were constructed as independent statues rather than built into the walls of the churches. From the 14th century onwards, the cathedrals and other large churches began to use mechanical clocks and the canonical sundials lost their utility, except in small rural churches, where they remained in use until the 16th century.\nThere are more than 3,000 surviving tide dials in England and at least 1,500 in France, mainly in Normandy, Touraine, Charente, and at monasteries along the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostella in northwestern Spain.\n\n\n== Design ==\nWith Christendom confined to the Northern Hemisphere, the tide dials were often carved vertically onto the south side of the church chancel at eye level near the priest's door. In an abbey or large monastery, dials were carefully carved into the stone walls, while in rural churches they were very often just scratched onto the wall.\nSome tide dials have a stone gnomon, but many have a circular hole which is used to hold a more easily replaced or adjusted wooden gnomon. These gnomons were perpendicular to the wall and cast a shadow upon the dial, a semicircle divided into a number of equal sectors. Most dials have supplementary lines marking the other 8 daytime hours, but are characterized by their noting the canonical hours particularly. The lines for the canonical hours may be longer or marked with a dot or cross. The divisions are seldom numbered.\nDials often have holes along the circumference of their semicircle. As additional gnomons were needless and these holes are often quite shallow, Cole suggests they were used to quickly and easily reconstruct the tide dials following a fresh whitewash of the church walls with chalk or lime.\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n=== Bewcastle Cross ===\n\nThe oldest surviving English tide dial is on the 7th- or 8th-century Bewcastle Cross in the church graveyard of St Cuthbert's in Bewcastle, Cumbria. It is carved on the south face of a Celtic cross at some height from the ground and is divided by five principal lines into four tides. Two of these lines, those for 9 am and noon, are crossed at the point. The four spaces are further subdivided so as to give the twelve daylight hours of the Romans. On one side of the dial, there is a vertical line which touches the semicircular border at the second afternoon hour. This may be an accident, but the same kind of line is found on the dial in the crypt of Bamburgh Church, where it marks a later hour of the day. The sundial may have been used for calculating the date of the spring equinox and hence Easter.\n\n\n=== Nendrum Sundial ===\n\nNendrum Monastery in Northern Ireland, supposedly founded in the 5th century by St Machaoi, now has a reconstructed tide dial. The 9th-century tide dial gives the name of its sculptor and a priest.\n\n\n=== Kirkdale Sundial ===\nThe 1056 x 1065 tide dial at St Gregory's Minster in Kirkdale, North Yorkshire, has four principal divisions marked by five crossed lines, subdivided by single lines. One marking \u00bc of the way between sunrise and noon is an incised cross that would indicate about 9 am at midwinter and 6 am at midsummer. It was dedicated to a \"Hawarth\".\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nProper tide dials prominently displaying the canonical hours:\n\nOther ecclesiastical sundials (\"mass dials\") used to determine times for prayer and mass during the same period:\n\n\n== See also ==\nSundial\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nCole, T.W.

            "content": "Shimmer Magazine is a quarterly magazine which publishes speculative fiction, with a focus on material that is dark, humorous or strange. Established in June 2005, Shimmer is published in digest format and Portable Document Format (PDF) and is edited by Beth Wodzinski. Shimmer has featured stories from award-winning authors Jay Lake and Ken Scholes; comic book artist Karl Kesel has also contributed artwork.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn mid-April 2005, Beth Wodzinski began having \"vague thoughts\" about starting an on-line, downloadable zine. While worried that she wouldn't have much time to devote to such a project, she wanted to support authors who wrote the kind of stories she liked, and to reject authors who wrote \"alright\" instead of \"all right.\" About a month later, Beth came up with the ideal name for her zine: \"Shimmer.\"\nBeth then recruited a few on-line friends to help develop the magazine. J.L. Radley, Jon Willesen, and Chris Hansen came on board, and Shimmer moved from its conception phase to its development and business model phase. Rather quickly, it became evident that more help would be needed, and Mary Robinette Kowal joined the Shimmery Staff as Art Director. Beth, Mary Robinette, and J.L. Radley all met on-line at Orson Scott Card's Hatrack River Writers Workshop forum.\nBarely a few weeks into development, a conversation on an on-line message board for writers precipitated a major discussion among the Shimmery Staff that changed how Shimmer would be delivered to its readers. Shimmer, Beth decided, would be a printed magazine. Though risky and requiring some more capital than initially planned for, Shimmer debuted as a digest-sized printed magazine with a perfect-bound glossy, color cover. Shimmer has since been well received by readers and critics; and esteemed Editor Ellen Datlow (whose interview appears in the Winter 2006 issue) wrote that Shimmer is \"worthwhile\" in the summary section of 2005 Year\u2019s Best Fantasy and Horror anthology.\n\n\n== Contributor payment ==\nSince August 2012, Shimmer has paid US$0.05/word, considered the minimum professional rate for speculative fiction writing. Contributors to earlier editions were paid lower rates (US $5/piece for the debut issue, Autumn 2005, rising to $10 for the next two issues and to $0.01/word in July 2006).\n\n\n== Circulation ==\nTo date, no mention of Shimmer's circulation totals, either print or electronic, appear on the official website or elsewhere on the Internet. There are, however, two \"news\" posts on the Shimmer site which claim Shimmer has placed fifth on Clarkesworld Books Bestseller List (magazines), one in April and another in June.\n\n\n== Other ==\nAll story and artwork submissions are received electronically via e-mail. Shimmer's Submissions Wrangler removes all personally-identifiable information from a manuscript and then forwards the story to one of Shimmer's editors, who read the story \"blind.\" This, Shimmer claims in its submission guidelines, allows for editors to judge whether a story merits acceptance based solely on the story and not which author submitted it. There are other publications which use a similar acceptance and rejection process. All stories that are not accepted receive personal rejection letters and feedback from the editor(s).\nJohn Joseph Adams, a.k.a. \"The Slush God,\" assistant editor of Fantasy and Science Fiction, edited Shimmer's special Pirate issue in Summer 2007.\nOne story from each issue is selected for an audio recording, sometimes read by the author who wrote the story.\nThere is (or was) another \"Shimmer Magazine\" published in Australia, with content geared towards women's fashion, but it is unclear if the Australian Shimmer is still in publication; this uncertainty is based on its website, which does not appear to have been updated since 2004.\n\n\n== The Issues ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nScience fiction magazine\nFantasy fiction magazine\nHorror fiction magazine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe official website of Shimmer Magazine\nTangent Reviews of Shimmer\nApex Online interviews Mary Robinette Kowal",

It is located near North Cowton in Richmondshire District Council in North Yorkshire.\nIt begins near the village green in North Cowton and ends on the back road between Dalton Gates and Moulton village.\nThe footpath crosses a field which was historically known as Scotch Graves, it is one of the possible sites of the Battle of the Standard in 1138. It is thought that the name Cramble Cross takes its name from a cross marking the last stand of the defeated Scottish soldiers.\nThe most interesting feature of this short walk is place where it crosses the cutting on the disbanded Eryholme-Richmond branch line. Further along the line to the west the cutting has been partially filled in and is used as a slurry pit by a local farmer.",

            "content": "Raiden V (\u96f7\u96fbV?) is a vertical scrolling shooting video game developed by MOSS  was the latest entry in the Raiden series, released on February 25, 2016 for the Xbox One in Japan. An updated version, titled Raiden V: Director's Cut, was released in Japan on September 14, 2017 for the PlayStation 4. A Western release was on October 5, 2017 for PlayStation 4 and through Steam and GOG.com on Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nGameplay in Raiden V is identical to its prior installments as well as Raiden IV, but since the plot of Raiden V is completely different from any former versions, it identifies many real places and many histories that formerly had been never done before. It contains the raiding of enemies in New York, Middle East, France, England, Ocean around Mediterranean; where most pirates were, and Sweden. (SHIFT industry does not exist in real life.)\nPlayers select an aircraft to play the game like in the Raiden Fighters Series and Raiden IV Overkill, these fighters are Azuma; aka famous ME-02, Spirit of Dragon and Moulin Rouge. They all have different grades of power, defense, mobility and sub-weapon that need not to be upgraded. Unlike Raiden IV, all aircraft have the same bomb as the ME-02 had.\nInterestingly, instead of using the previous system, Raiden V has only 1 life that means when destroyed, the game is over, instead players have a shield status indicating how much damage the aircraft can take before crashing. Different aircraft can take different amounts of damage and it can evaluate the progress of players with the same difficulties as well.\nFlash Point has improved since its introduction in Raiden III. There are five levels of Flash Point gauge, the chain score challenge players have to run for taking the leaderboard. The first level starts at 2.0 and ends up to 6.0 for Max Level. Fast killing blow will fill the gauge of Flash Point to reach the next level. Bigger enemies and larger multiplier can fill the larger amount of the gauge. When the killing blow goes slower or stops, the gauge will be depleted for the time. More levels will cause depletion faster. Entering the boss fight will stop depletion only during the boss transformation.\nThe Cheer System is very new to Raiden V since the leaderboard run is the real time game. Online players being as friends can cheer the other one to unlock the skill \"Cheer Call\". When players struggle, using Cheer Call will cancel all enemy bullet at once and allow players to greatly boost sub-weapons for a short time until Cheer Call gauge is depleted. Boosted sub-weapons cause heavy damage and instant attack speed. Cheer Call gauge can increase slowly by progressive play and rapidly every time the player presses \"Cheer\" (Default button Y or triangle on PS4 version) to the others who get any achievement (trophy on PS4 version) of each certain stage such as Sol Destroyed or Boss No Miss. Players who receive many cheer counts will increase the cheer call gauge slightly faster so the game calls Cheer; Benefits to Everyone.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\nBefore the game starts, player will choose an aircraft for the full course of the game. Different aircraft will have different statuses and unique weapons on their own.\nAzuma (Japan) (Japan Air Self Defense Force)\nPower - Medium\nDefense - Medium (Taking 17% Damage)\nSpeed - Medium\nSub Weapon - Homing Rockets\nSpirit of Dragon (United States of America) (U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force)\nPower - High\nDefense - High (Taking 13% Damage)\nSpeed - Low\nSub Weapon - Nuclear Missile\nMoulin Rouge (France) (Arm\u00e9e de l'Air)\nPower - Low\nDefense - Low (Taking 20% Damage)\nSpeed - High\nSub Weapon - Chasing Laser\n\n\n=== Weapons ===\nWeapons in Raiden V are the combination among all former Raiden series, from Raiden III and IV, collected weapon power ups will upgrade one level per pick up even when power up color is different from current weapon, but Raiden V uses the weapon system in Raiden I and II wherey collecting a different weapon power up will only change weapon, not upgrade. That means collecting power ups in Raiden V will upgrade only one weapon at a time.\nBefore player departure, after choosing a machine for a run, you have to reconfigure 3 different kinds of 3 main weapons for any tactical and strategic screen control for maximum efficiency. Some weapons can be found only in Raiden Fighters series and some weapons are newer to this game legacy.\nThis weapon system, however, is one of the True Last Boss unlock conditions. Besides clearing all S Rank since Mission 2 and A Rank at Mission 1, all weapons require maximum 10 levels as well. The number of power ups throughout the game are 32.\n\n\n=== Vulcan Weapon ===\nWide Vulcan\n\nThis is the traditional vulcan gun of Raiden series, firing a salvo of vulcan at the fixed variant angles like any former versions. Unlike those, Wide Vulcan in Raiden V can be upgraded 9 times by the first run 3 ways with 2 pellets, then run with 3 and 4 pellets and increase wide range by 4, 5 and 7 ways respectively. In the last upgrade, the frontal shot will come with 2 straight ways instead of 1.\n\nSwing Vulcan\n\nSwing Vulcan is the unique directional shot from Raiden Fighters series, shooting narrow vulcan pellets at the enemies with higher firepower than the traditional Wide Vulcan. The special ability of this type is to swing at player's horizontal movements, making it ideal for screen control since the angles are narrower, being easier to do a flash kill. Collecting this will increase range of 3, 4 and 5 ways with 1 and 2 pellets for every 5 levels. The level 6 will reset to 3 ways and a pellet like level 1 again but player will shoot out in twin salvos.\n\nMoving Vulcan\n\nThis expert type of vulcan is the most powerful weapon in Raiden V, yet the most difficult to use as an effective killer as well. The weapon will run like Swing Vulcan, but instead the wide angles depend on player's vertical movements. This is rather horrible to make a flash kill, but instead of using Laser, this weapon is exclusive for boss killer if expertise is perfect. Collecting the weapon will increase the number of pellets from 2 to 3 and 4 respectively, and increase the power of pellets instead since this type has only 3 ways.\n\n\n=== Laser Weapon ===\nLightning Laser\n\nThis is another traditional weapon of Raiden series besides Wide Vulcan. Shoot out a narrow powerful blue laser that continuously damage any enemies that come across the laser path. Unlike any plasma weapon, Lightning Laser range will be cut whether the enemies that come across are small or not. Player's movement will swerve the laser slightly due to lateral weapon beam. Collecting the power up will increase the power and the width of laser.\n\nCharge Laser\n\nThis weapon can be more powerful and increase the size by charging the laser and launch at once. More the time charging more the laser became more powerful and very destructive. The max charged can wipe out almost all enemies on the screen.\n\nReflect Laser\n\n\n=== Plasma Weapon ===\nBend Plasma\n\nOr well-known as \"Toothpaste Plasma\", the still returning weapon from Raiden II to IV. This weapon appears as a narrow purple beam that can bend to the left or right arcs, traces enemies and curves upon movement. All enemies will take damage in the path of the beam and besides main target, an arc can even hit other enemies as well. When the target is destroyed, the beam will fire straight again until the next target is locked. Collecting power-ups will increase the width and the power of the beam like Laser.\n\nCatch Plasma\n\nThe advanced upgrade of traditional Proton Plasma from Raiden IV is the easiest, yet most destructive plasma weapon in Raiden V. Which is similar to one of Noah's element shoot in Caladrius Blaze. This weapon will fire only short range plasma beams at wide range and comes out with a circlet catcher to find and lock any targets in range. Small units can be destroyed upon catching up while the larger units will take continuous damage from the sight. An enemy can be caught up by up to all plasma beams available, causing rapid damage per second. Collecting this power up will start with 2 narrow plasma beams and increase the number, power and width of beams from 2 to 3,4 beams respectively. A final upgrade will comes up with 5 plasma beams.\n\nHoming Plasma\n\nThis weapon is the inspiration of Raystorm series but resembles and works a lot like the homing lasers in Caladrius more so than Raiden Fighter 2's Aegis II-C, playing another important role of flash killing. This weapon will shoot out a salvo of plasma lasers which home in on any targets on a screen. When the main target is locked, any units in the path of plasma beams behind main targets will be cut through, dealing damage as well. Any beams leaving the screen will be compensated by another shot immediately. Collecting the power up will increase the number of salvo from 3, 4 and 5 beams respectively. Then increase the power, width and the attack speed of Homing Plasma.\n\n\n== Characters ==\nUnnamed pilot, callsign \"Raiden\" (player)\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRaiden V was released to generally favorable reviews, according to Metacritic, which provided aggregated scores of 75 and 73 for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions, respectively.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "Confederate General Robert E. Lee issued his Farewell Address, also known as General Order No. 9 (sometimes Orders) to his Army of Northern Virginia on April 10, 1865, the day after he surrendered the army to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Lee's surrender was instrumental in bringing about the end of the American Civil War. The text of the order, which were written and drafted by Col. Charles Marshall, edited and finalized by Lee, were issued as follows:\n\nHeadquarters, Army of Northern Virginia, 10th April 1865.\nGeneral Order\nNo. 9\nAfter four years of arduous service marked by unsurpassed courage and fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers and resources.\nI need not tell the survivors of so many hard fought battles, who have remained steadfast to the last, that I have consented to the result from no distrust of them.\nBut feeling that valour and devotion could accomplish nothing that could compensate for the loss that must have attended the continuance of the contest, I have determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them to their countrymen.\nBy the terms of the agreement, officers and men can return to their homes and remain until exchanged. You will take with you the satisfaction that proceeds from the consciousness of duty faithfully performed, and I earnestly pray that a merciful God will extend to you his blessing and protection.\nWith an unceasing admiration of your constancy and devotion to your Country, and a grateful remembrance of your kind and generous consideration for myself, I bid you an affectionate farewell.\n\nThe following is taken from a letter dated September 27, 1887, to General Bradley T. Johnson from Colonel Charles Marshall, CSA.\n\nGeneral Lee's order to the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House was written the day after the meeting at McLean's house, at which the terms of the surrender were agreed upon. That night the general sat with several of us at a fire in front of his tent, and after some conversation about the army, and the events of the day, in which his feelings toward his men were strongly expressed, he told me to prepare an order to the troops.\nThe next day it was raining, and many persons were coming and going, so that I was unable to write without interruption until about 10 o'clock, when General Lee, finding that the order had not been prepared, directed me to get into his ambulance, which stood near his tent, and placed an orderly to prevent any one from approaching me.\nI sat in the ambulance until I had written the order, the first draft of which (in pencil) contained an entire paragraph that was omitted by General Lee's direction. He made one or two verbal changes, and I then made a copy of the order as corrected, and gave it to one of the clerks in the adjutant-general's office to write in ink. I took the copy, when made by the clerk, to the general, who signed it, and other copies were then made for transmission to the corps commanders and the staff of the army. All these copies were signed by the general, and a good many persons sent other copies which they had made or procured, and obtained his signature. In this way many copies of the order had the general's name signed as if they were originals, some of which I have seen.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRobert E.

The inaugural year saw a class of 23 students and by the spring term of 1948 there were 70 students attending AMTI. Although AMTI was an autonomously governed organization it did not have its own campus, the school was located in the Saskatoon Apostolic Church.\nIn 1949 the ACOP and the Evangelical Churches of Pentecost began the process of amalgamating the two Pentecostal fellowships. Coincidentally both Fellowships had a missionary and training center, it was decided however that it would benefit both fellowships if the bible schools also amalgamated. This process began in 1949 and the two schools officially came together on 8 October 1953. It was decided that the Apostolic Missionary Training Institute would dissolve and become part of the Full Gospel Bible Institute based in Eston Saskatchewan. Students from AMTI in the winter of 1954 started classes at the Full Gospel Bible Institute under the leadership of Dr. G. S. McLean.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nLarden, Robert A. (1971).

            ], 
            "content": "Global illumination (shortened as GI), or indirect illumination, is a general name for a group of algorithms used in 3D computer graphics that are meant to add more realistic lighting to 3D scenes. Such algorithms take into account not only the light that comes directly from a light source (direct illumination), but also subsequent cases in which light rays from the same source are reflected by other surfaces in the scene, whether reflective or not (indirect illumination).\nTheoretically, reflections, refractions, and shadows are all examples of global illumination, because when simulating them, one object affects the rendering of another (as opposed to an object being affected only by a direct light). In practice, however, only the simulation of diffuse inter-reflection or caustics is called global illumination.\n\n\n== Algorithms ==\nImages rendered using global illumination algorithms often appear more photorealistic than those using only direct illumination algorithms. However, such images are computationally more expensive and consequently much slower to generate. One common approach is to compute the global illumination of a scene and store that information with the geometry (e.g., radiosity). The stored data can then be used to generate images from different viewpoints for generating walkthroughs of a scene without having to go through expensive lighting calculations repeatedly.\nRadiosity, ray tracing, beam tracing, cone tracing, path tracing, Metropolis light transport, ambient occlusion, photon mapping, and image based lighting are all examples of algorithms used in global illumination, some of which may be used together to yield results that are not fast, but accurate.\nThese algorithms model diffuse inter-reflection which is a very important part of global illumination; however most of these (excluding radiosity) also model specular reflection, which makes them more accurate algorithms to solve the lighting equation and provide a more realistically illuminated scene. The algorithms used to calculate the distribution of light energy between surfaces of a scene are closely related to heat transfer simulations performed using finite-element methods in engineering design.\n\n\n== Photorealism ==\n\nAchieving accurate computation of global illumination in real-time remains difficult. In real-time 3D graphics, the diffuse inter-reflection component of global illumination is sometimes approximated by an \"ambient\" term in the lighting equation, which is also called \"ambient lighting\" or \"ambient color\" in 3D software packages. Though this method of approximation (also known as a \"cheat\" because it's not really a global illumination method) is easy to perform computationally, when used alone it does not provide an adequately realistic effect. Ambient lighting is known to \"flatten\" shadows in 3D scenes, making the overall visual effect more bland. However, used properly, ambient lighting can be an efficient way to make up for a lack of processing power.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nMore and more specialized algorithms are used in 3D programs that can effectively simulate the global illumination. These algorithms are numerical approximations to the rendering equation. Well known algorithms for computing global illumination include path tracing, photon mapping and radiosity.

On his return, the player who had left the Est\u00e1dio da G\u00e1vea when the team was headed by Ney Franco, found it Joel Santana that there had miraculously led the team will Copa Libertadores and hit the back four definitely formed by Ronaldo Angelim and Captain F\u00e1bio Luciano, it would still be double reinforced in early 2008 by Rodrigo.\nThus, Nilt\u00e3o once again did not find good opportunities, and eventually borrowed again, now for the America. While serving at Mequinha, the central back ended up living a rather complicated phase due to the decline of the red team to the second division of the Campeonato Carioca, so that when he came back to Est\u00e1dio da G\u00e1vea later that year, the athlete even been linked by the then coach Caio J\u00fanior.\nFulfill the contract with Flamengo until May 2009, always training separately, and the end of the commitment to Brazil's Most Wanted, Nilt\u00e3o been without a club until August of that year, when hit with the team from the Rio Branco. Later, in 2010, the defender headed to Bolivia, in order to play for the Wilstermann. There Nilt\u00e3o finally had success including being responsible for the goal of the conquest of Torneo Apertura 2010.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nWilstermann\nTorneio Apertura: 2010\n\n\n== Contract ==\nFlamengo 1 June 2007 to 30 May 2009.\nTupi (Loan) 11 June 2007 to 2 December 2007.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Portuguese) Player profile @ Flap\u00e9dia\n(in English) sambafoot\n(in Portuguese) tupijf",

He has previously played in the Football League for Shrewsbury Town, and had a nomadic career in non-league football.\n\n\n== Career ==\nMarsden played youth team football with Wrexham and Wigan Athletic, and was a prolific goal scorer for Liverpool Schoolboys at under-14 and under-15 levels. He joined Scottish club Celtic at the age of 16, signing a professional contract. He spent the 2010\u201311 season on loan to Hamilton Academical's youth team. Whilst at Celtic, Marsden suffered a broken foot, all but ending his chances of breaking into the first team, and was subsequently released. He moved on to Rochdale, playing on non-contract terms for their reserve side and scoring eight in 14 games. After a contract failed to materialise, however, he joined Welsh Premier League side Aberystwyth Town and then Stockport Sports.\nAfter scoring 21 goals in 31 matches for Stockport Sports he earned a trial at Stoke City. His trial was successful and he signed a contract until the end of the 2012\u201313 season. Marsden failed to extend his stay at Stoke and joined Shrewsbury Town in July 2013 after a trial period. He made his professional debut in a goalless draw against Milton Keynes Dons on 3 August 2013, and appeared again in a League Cup defeat to Bolton Wanderers, but broke a bone in his foot early in the game, an injury which ruled him out for up to eight weeks. On 24 January 2014, Shrewsbury Town confirmed the departure of Marsden by mutual consent.\nOn 4 August 2014 Marsden joined Conference Premier side Southport. He moved on loan to Lincoln City for the rest of the season on 12 February 2015. He then had a short spell at Macclesfield Town, making two appearances in August 2015 before joining Welsh side Colwyn Bay.\nMarsden joined Stockport County in January 2016.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\nAs of match played 9 December 2017\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJohn Marsden at Soccerbase \nJohn Marsden at Soccerway",

Franz Ehrlich was a student at the Bauhaus in Dessau from 1927 to 1930.\nEhrlich was a Communist and was arrested and imprisoned by the Nazi regime in 1935. He was taken to Buchenwald concentration camp where, because he was an architect, he was tasked to design the entrance gates for the camp. Ehrlich subsequently became the paid main designer for the camp's construction office, designing furnishings for the commandant's house among other jobs. Later a fellow prisoner claimed Ehrlich had helped the Resistance by passing construction details to them.\nAfter World War II had concluded, Ehrlich worked on reconstruction in Dresden. During the 1960s he was employed as chief architect for the Leipzig Trade Fair: he designed a \"Fair Tower\" (\"Messturm\") for it, but this was never built.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJedem das Seine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFranz Ehrlich.

Industrial technology -- the body of knowledge that is specific to a certain industry or business and without which that industry of business cannot operate at all\n2. Business technology -- the formalized processes, procedures and rules that are employed to run an enterprise based on a certain industrial technology\n3. Information technology -- the resources used to acquire, process, store and disseminate information generated or used by the employed business technologies.\nTechnology governance also means the governance, i.e., the steering between the different sectors\u2014state, business, and NGOs\u2014of the development of technology. The concept is based on the notion of innovation and of techno-economic paradigm shifts according to the theories of Joseph A. Schumpeter, Christopher Freeman, Carlota Perez, etc.\nThe idea here is that certain periods in economic development are dominated by a paradigm-leading technology that influences through finance mechanisms, organizational change, greater returns, etc. Also, the economic and social sphere to such an extent that an entire paradigm is coined by them. Currently, that paradigm-leading technology is information and communications technology (ICT). According to Innovation Theory (and empirical findings as well), states, regions, or other communities do not automatically promote, or even go into, these key technologies, but rather need to be guided there by active intervention, by the State sector (in close cooperation and coordination). Technology governance, (as a field of scholarly inquiry and academic instruction) is therefore about how this is theoretically and practically done, which institutions are optimal for such a venue, how the education of administrators have to look like if they are going to have the administrative capacity to deal with such matters, etc.\nTechnology governance is a central focus and is part of the Lisbon Strategy, the main economic and social development program of the European Union.\nTechnology governance is a public policy concept; it is not to be confused with inner-corporate arrangements of organisation (corporate governance) and IT arrangements, sometimes called Information Technology Governance.\n\n\n== External links ==\nTechnology Governance website at Tallinn University of Technology",

The structure suggests that it once was a pagan tomb, possibly dating back to Phoenician times. The place is credited with various magical properties: thus those who suffer from headaches or other diseases walk three times round it and leave pieces of clothing or tufts of their hair on the grill in front of the south window. It is also much frequented by females, who come here to pray for the safety of overseas lovers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nFaneromeni Monastery in Lefkadas (Greek Wikipedia)\nFaneromeni Monastery in Salamina (Greek Wikipedia)",

            "content": "The Fleece Inn is a public house in Bretforton, in the Vale of Evesham, Worcestershire, England: the half-timbered building, over six hundred years old, has been a pub since 1848, and is now owned by the National Trust. The inn was extensively damaged by fire on 27 February 2004, and after repairs and rebuilding were completed the Fleece officially reopened on 18 June 2005. The pub holds an annual asparagus festival asparagus and auction while there are three morris sides based at the pub: Pebworth, Belle d'Vain and Asum Gras. There is a regular folk night plus concerts and weddings in the medieval barn.\n\n\n== History ==\nOwned by the National Trust, The Fleece Inn was originally built in the early 15th century as a longhouse (an early type of farmhouse accommodating both livestock and humans) by a prosperous yeoman farmer called Byrd. It later became a pub, which was rebuilt in the 17th century and remained in the Byrd family until 1977, when Lola Taplin bequeathed it to the National Trust. Lola was a direct descendant of Mr Byrd, and lived her entire life at the Fleece. She died at 77, having run the pub on her own for the last 30 years of her life.The Inn suffered serious fire damage after a fire broke out in the thatch in February 2004, and the business temporarily moved to a nearby barn during the 14 month long restoration.\nReputedly Oliver Cromwell\u2019s pewter dinner service was exchanged on the way to the battle of Worcester and this is on display at the pub. Even if this account is not true, it is an example of 17th century Jacobean English Pewter ware.\nA curious medieval tradition also survives at the Fleece, preserved in accordance with Lola's wishes. This is the practice of chalking \"witch circles\" on the floor in front of each hearth to prevent witches from getting in through the chimneys. There are also \"witch marks\" on the inside of the door, to keep evil spirits out.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nThe BBC used The Fleece Inn and the surrounding village green for its 1994 production of Charles Dickens' novel Martin Chuzzlewit; the pub was renamed the \"Blue Dragon\" for the duration of shooting\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Fleece Inn\nHistoric England. \"Details from image database (148630)\".

            "content": "PAMS (an acronym for Production, Advertising, Merchandising Service), based in Dallas, Texas, was one of the most famous jingle production companies in American broadcasting. It produced identification packages for radio stations around the world, as well as some commercial music.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded by William B. Meeks, Jr. (1921\u20131999) in 1951.\nMeeks worked on the air and also sold advertising, often creating jingles for some of the clients he sold time to. Eventually he decided to devote all his time to advertising, and in 1951 he started PAMS Advertising Agency, Inc. Initially, very few station jingles were made, but it wasn't until the mid-1950s that individual cuts were assembled into packages that could be syndicated to stations all over the country.\nAfter the success of the first few PAMS jingle series, the company's focus slowly shifted to providing IDs to the ever growing number of top-40 radio stations. By the end of 1964, PAMS' primary business had become station jingles, and the name of the company was shortened to PAMS, Inc.\nSoon, PAMS was a leader in the usage of pre-recorded backing tracks with new vocals over them to create the syndication of ID Jingles.\nIt suspended operation in 1978, and for the next 12 years, PAMS jingles were produced under the CPMG/PAMS moniker run by Ken R. Deutsch (in Toledo, Ohio) and Benjamin R. Freedman (December 26, 1949\u2014January 9, 2013) (both in the Buffalo, New York, area and Dallas, Texas). In 1990, the original PAMS corporation, including all its copyrights, was purchased by JAM Creative Productions (also based in Dallas).\nJAM currently produces new versions of the classic PAMS jingle packages over the original PAMS backing tracks but technically is still a separate company from PAMS. JAM founder Jonathan M. Wolfert was employed by PAMS before he and wife Mary Lyn Wolfert started their own company in 1974.\nMany of PAMS jingle packages were used exclusively in the 1960s and early 1970s by stations worldwide, including WABC in New York City, WLS in Chicago, UK offshore pirate radio station Wonderful Radio London and BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom.\nPAMS address was just as famous as its jingles. The studios were located at 4141 Office Parkway; which is now part of the Cityplace district of Dallas. It was also the home of Thompson Creative which entered the radio station ID business in the mid 1980s.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEuel Box\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

            "content": "The X Factor is a British television music competition to find new singing talent. The tenth series began airing on ITV on 31 August, and finished on 15 December 2013. Dermot O'Leary returned to present the main show on ITV and Caroline Flack was back to present spin-off show The Xtra Factor on ITV2, along with comedian Matt Richardson, who replaced Olly Murs. Flack also presented backstage segments during the live shows. Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Nicole Scherzinger returned as judges for their respective tenth, third and second series, with Sharon Osbourne returning to replace Tulisa after five series away. This was Barlow's final series as a judge. Osbourne and Scherzinger also departed the series, but reprised their roles as judges with Walsh again in series 13.\nAuditions for the series started in March 2013 with mobile auditions taking place in 23 towns and cities. After this, open auditions in front of producers took place in April and May in London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester and Glasgow. Auditions in front of the judges occurred in June and July in the same five cities, with two types of audition: auditionees who were successful in a first audition in an audition room, used for the first time since series 5, went on to attend an audition in an arena, which replaced the rooms in series 6. After bootcamp and judges' houses, the live shows began on 12 October 2013, and ran until the final on 15 December 2013, which was won by over 25s contestant Sam Bailey. This marked the first time someone from the over 25s category had won the show since Steve Brookstein won series 1 in 2004. It also marked the first time that Osbourne had been the winning mentor, having failed during her first stint on the show. As the winner, Bailey received a \u00a31 million recording contract with Syco Music, and also supported Beyonc\u00e9 at one of her shows during the UK leg of her The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in 2014.\nThis was the final series of the three-year deal signed by Simon Cowell in 2010, before it was announced by ITV on 15 November that the show's contract was extended by a further three years, keeping it on air until 2016.\n\n\n== Judges, presenters and other personnel ==\n\nIt was reported on 22 February 2013 that Tulisa would not return for series 10, after being a judge for two series. She initially denied this and said she wanted to return, However, Tulisa confirmed on 21 May after months of speculation that she would not return to the judging panel. The following day, it was confirmed that former judge Sharon Osbourne, who had been on the panel from series 1 to series 4 would join the remaining three judges from series 9, Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Nicole Scherzinger, ending rumours that Scherzinger may leave to focus on her second studio album and be replaced by series 9 guest judge Mel B.\nOsbourne stated in July that she was back for just one series, \"to go out on a high\", and during the first live show, Barlow revealed that this would be his last series on the show. Walsh, who has appeared on the show since its inception, announced he would be leaving the show after this series as well, stating that he wanted his \"life back\", although he later said he \"might come back\" if Simon Cowell returned, and later still he said he would most likely continue, claiming \"I'm having so much fun this year, I might stay\". Walsh eventually confirmed his return for series 11, following the returns of both Cowell and Cheryl.\nDermot O'Leary returned to present the main show on ITV for his seventh series, whilst Caroline Flack came back to present spin-off show The Xtra Factor on ITV2. Olly Murs, Flack's co-presenter for series 8 and 9, wanted to focus on his music career and therefore did not come back. On 29 May, it was announced that comedian Matt Richardson would co-present The Xtra Factor with Flack, after reports that Nick Grimshaw, Dave Berry or Rylan Clark may replace Murs. Flack also presented backstage on the main X Factor programme, during the live shows on Saturdays. Yvie Burnett returned as vocal coach. Brian Burke left as creative director and was replaced by Jerry Reeve and Mark \"Swany\" Hart.\n\n\n== Selection process ==\n\n\n=== Auditions ===\n\n\n==== Mobile auditions ====\nBetween 25 March and 1 April 2013, mobile auditions took place in Inverness,Great Yarmouth, Warrington, Aberdeen, Colchester, Hull, Dumfries, Grimsby, Romford, Belfast, Newport on the Isle of Wight, Sunderland, Wakefield, Bangor, Middlesbrough, Yeovil, Aberystwyth, Blackburn, Dublin, Blackpool, Cork, Merthyr Tydfil and Newport in Wales. It was reported that around 20 people attended Colchester auditions on 26 March and producers tried to convince passers-by to audition. A spokesperson for the show commented: \"The X Factor mobile auditions are taking place across the UK this week, allowing budding artists to try out in towns and cities where the auditions tour doesn't reach. The numbers attending vary from location to location and are on a par with last year when we found our winner James Arthur. Overall applications are strong for this series and are in line with last year. We've had strong turnouts at other locations for the mobile auditions with more than 250 people turning up at Hull and over 100 in Great Yarmouth.\"\n\n\n==== Open auditions ====\n\nFor the first time since series 6, auditions took place in five cities instead of six. Open auditions in front of the show's producers began in London (ExCeL London) on 6 April and continued in Birmingham (International Convention Centre) on 13 April, Cardiff (Millennium Stadium) on 20 April, and Manchester (Old Trafford) on 27 April, before concluding in Glasgow (SECC) on 1 May. Auditions were not held in Liverpool this year, after it was one of the locations in the past two series. Producers said that they were \"mixing it up\", although reports claim that they were unimpressed with talent in Liverpool, despite three consecutive finalists\u2014Rebecca Ferguson (series 7), Marcus Collins (series 8) and Christopher Maloney (series 9)\u2014coming from Liverpool. Additionally, auditions returned to Birmingham after being replaced by Newcastle in series 9. Producers previously held auditions in Newcastle instead of Birmingham because they thought that Birmingham provided \"no memorable talent\", but reportedly decided to return there after \"disappointing\" results in Newcastle. Almost 8,000 auditionees attended in London, whilst Cardiff attracted at least 3,000, Birmingham produced around 5,000, over 4,000 auditioned in Manchester and over 2,000 in Glasgow.\n\n\n==== Judges' auditions ====\nThis series saw the return of the original auditions format last used in series 5, where auditionees performed in a room in front of the judges. Those who were successful in the room auditions then faced a second audition in an arena\u2014the format used since series 6\u2014to prove they can impress an audience. If they were successful in this audition, they entered the bootcamp stage of the competition. Cowell hoped the \"intimate\" room auditions would increase ratings. The room auditions in front of the judges began in Glasgow on 4 June at the Hilton Glasgow Grosvenor Hotel and continued in Birmingham on 10 June at the International Convention Centre. Manchester auditions took place over three days from 13 to 15 June at Old Trafford, followed by London auditions which also took place over three days, from 19 to 21 June at ExCeL London. Due to a lack of successful groups, extra auditions specifically for groups took place on 1 July at Price Studios in Battersea, London. Auditions then concluded in Cardiff on 3 July at the Motorpoint Arena. The arena auditions took place at a single venue, Wembley Arena, over four days, from 15 to 18 July. The broadcast of auditions started on 31 August 2013, with room auditions being shown on Saturday nights and arena auditions on Sundays.\nThe first room audition episode aired on 31 August, and featured auditions from Cardiff, Manchester, London and Birmingham. The second room audition episode featured auditions from Manchester, Cardiff and Glasgow. The third room audition episode showcased auditions from London, Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow.\nNumerous contestants from previous series returned to audition again for this series, including: Amy Mottram, who was Tulisa's wildcard contestant in series 9 and failed to be chosen ahead of Maloney as the 13th finalist; Terry Winstanley, who made it to judges' houses in series 8; Johnny Rocco, whose audition in series 4 ended with him \"cursing\" Walsh after getting a \"no\" from all four judges; John Adams, who reached bootcamp in series 8; Curtis Golden, Joseph Whelan and Gathan Cheema, all of whom got to bootcamp in series 9; Stephanie Woods, who got to judges' houses in series 4; Jade Richards, who got to judges' houses in series 8 and bootcamp in series 9; and Melanie McCabe, who got to bootcamp in series 5 and 9 and to judges' houses in series 8. Also auditioning again were groups Rough Copy, who were initially to through to judges' houses in series 9 but had to back out due to visa problems, and The Dolly Rockers, who made it to judges' houses in series 3. Another notable group to audition were 1990s pop rock band Next of Kin, who were once labelled \"the British Hanson\".\n\n\n=== Bootcamp ===\nOn 17 April 2013, it was reported that this series' bootcamp could be changed and be conducted abroad like judges' houses, however, it was later confirmed that bootcamp would take place at Wembley Arena over four days, across three sessions between 9 and 12 August. It was reported that Cowell was planning to give advice on which acts should progress through this stage, meeting with the judges on his yacht to give opinions on the acts, but further reports claimed that due to a pregnancy scandal, Cowell would instead speak to the judges by telephone, as he did in series 9. However, this did not happen.\nIn a change to the usual format, the judges were allocated their categories before bootcamp, via a phonecall from executive producer Richard Holloway. Walsh has the Boys, Scherzinger had the Girls, Osbourne has the Over 25s and Barlow has the Groups. On the first day of bootcamp, soloists were put into groups of three within their category, and groups were put into pairs. They had to perform within that pair or group, and the category judge would then decide who would continue. There was then a change in the format, that saw the judges choose the acts to advance to judges' houses immediately after their bootcamp performance, instead of waiting until everyone had performed. Each judge had six places to their judges house, and they granted a 'seat' to the performers they wanted to advance in their category. However, if a judge already chose six acts for their category, they could replace them if they preferred a later performer, therefore causing bootcamp to be branded the 'ultimate game of musical chairs'. Bootcamp was broadcast over two episodes, each of 90 minutes, on 28 and 29 September.\n\n\n=== Judges' houses ===\nJudges' houses took place in September. Each judge took the remaining members of their category to an overseas location, and had guests to assist them in their decisions. Walsh was assisted by Nicole Appleton, Sinitta and Shane Filan when he mentored the Boys in Saint-Tropez, France, in a property worth \u00a310.5 million, next door to a property owned by Nicolas Sarkozy, whose gardeners interrupted filming. Osbourne took the Over 25s to her own home in Beverly Hills, California, assisted by Robbie Williams; Barlow was assisted by series 6 runner-up and former The Xtra Factor co-presenter Olly Murs to mentor the Groups in New York City; and Scherzinger took the Girls to Antigua with Mary J. Blige, staying at the St James Club resort. Groups Code 4 and Rough Copy were forced to lose a member each during judges' houses because of visa problems. At judges' houses each act performed two songs for their mentor and his/her guest judge, although only one song was mentioned and shown on the main show, with the other song shown on The Xtra Factor instead (although only the acts who made it to the live shows had their second songs shown). Judges' houses was broadcast over two programmes, on 5 and 6 October.\n\n\n== Finalists ==\n\nKey:\n     \u2013 Winner\n     \u2013 Runner-up\n     \u2013 Third place\n\n\n== Live shows ==\nThe live shows started on 12 October. As in previous series, each week's song choices followed a particular theme. Each contestant performed on Saturday, while eliminations and guest performances took place on Sunday. For the first three weeks, a new \"flash vote\" took place at the end of each Saturday night show, where the voting lines opened for about eight minutes, and the act with the fewest votes faced the \"sing-off\" (formerly called the \"final showdown\") on Sunday. Voting lines for the remaining contestants then reopened, and stayed open until the Sunday shows, where the second contestant to face the \"sing-off\" was revealed. \"Deadlock\", where the act with the fewest public votes is eliminated after the judges' votes are tied, was eliminated while there was a flash vote, and instead, in the event that judges' votes were tied, the contestant that lost the flash vote was eliminated. However, in week 4 the flash vote was rested because of Nile Rodgers and Chic's performance, meaning there was not enough time at the end of the show for the flash vote, and \"deadlock\" would have returned if the judges' votes had been tied, and the flash vote did not return after this. Deadlock was used in weeks 8 and 9 due to tie votes from the judges.\nThe final took place at Wembley Arena on 14 and 15 December 2013.\n\n\n=== Musical guests ===\nEach results show featured musical performances from at least two artists, while occasionally, artists performed on the main performances show. Ellie Goulding and Cher performed on the first results show, Robin Thicke and Katy Perry performed on the second, and The Wanted and Lady Gaga performed on the third. Nile Rodgers and Chic performed a medley of three songs on the fourth live show, in what was billed as a \"special edition\" of The X Factor. Little Mix performed on the fourth live results show, followed by Taylor Swift with Gary Lightbody. Robbie Williams and Celine Dion appeared on the fifth results show, though Dion's performance was pre-recorded. The sixth live results show featured performances from judge Gary Barlow, who was relaunching his solo career, and Miley Cyrus. Olly Murs performed on the seventh live show, then JLS, Mary J. Blige with Jessie J, and One Direction performed on the seventh live results show. Rebecca Ferguson and James Arthur performed on the eighth results show, Leona Lewis and Michael Bubl\u00e9 performed on the semi-final live results show, Tom Odell and The Killers performed in the first show of the final, and One Direction, Perry, Elton John and Barlow performed in the second show of the final.\n\n\n=== Results summary ===\nColour key\n^1 Owing to the freezing of votes, the voting percentages in weeks 1, 2, 3 and 10 for Sundays do not add up to 100%. Shelley Smith received 0.9% of the final vote in week 1, Kingsland Road rececived 1.9% of the final vote in week 2, Miss Dynamix received 1.1% of the final vote in week 3 and Luke Friend received 10.3% of the final vote in week 10.\n^2 Miss Dynamix were given a bye in week 2 as band member SeSe Foster was too ill to perform.\n^3 Walsh did not need to vote as Scherzinger and Osbourne had already voted to eliminate Miss Dynamix; having lost the flash vote, they would have been sent home regardless of Walsh's decision.

Bailey's winner's single \"Skyscraper\" was released on 16 December, the day after she won, and sold over 100,000 copies to become the Christmas number one on 22 December. This made Bailey the first X Factor winner since Matt Cardle in 2010 to gain the Christmas number one (series 8 winners Little Mix and series 9 winner James Arthur both released their winners' singles two weeks before the Christmas chart, thus avoiding the Christmas number-one battle, although they both charted in the top three of the Christmas chart regardless). On 24 November, it was revealed that the winner's single, like Arthur's, would be a charity release to raise money for Together for Short Lives, and also the Great Ormond Street Hospital. If Nicholas McDonald had won, he would have released \"Superman (It's Not Easy)\" as his winner's single.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\nThe series launch on 31 August 2013 received average overnight ratings of 8.78 million, a 40% share of the viewing audience at that time, and peaked at 9.08 million. The average rating was 680,000 more viewers than the series 9 launch, but still 2.5 million fewer than the series 8 launch. The first Sunday show the following night attracted average overnight ratings of 9.21 million, a 36.2% audience share. This was officially the highest rated episode of the series. The following Saturday, on 7 September, the ratings dropped to 840,000 fewer than the launch, an overnight rating of 7.94 million. The second Sunday show saw viewers fall by 300,000 viewers compared to the previous Sunday, but it was up by more than 1 million on the fourth auditions episode of series 9. The ratings for the third Saturday show were up on the second by 710,000, with an average overnight rating of 8.65 million. The next day, the average overnight ratings reached 9.08 million and peaked at 10.7 million. The final weekend of auditions saw viewers decrease by around 200,000 on the Saturday, though the next day saw the show reach a new peak audience of 9.42 million, according to overnight figures.\n1 Includes advert breaks2 Excludes ITV+13 The rank for the ITV broadcast, compared with all channels for that week, from Monday to Sunday.\n\n\n=== Controversy and criticism ===\n\n\n==== Trailer ====\nThe mash-up video trailer promoting the tenth series was published as a \"mash up of all the best a decade of X Factor has to offer\" on 25 July 2013. The trailer consists of various music videos from 13 past contestants: winners Shayne Ward, Leona Lewis, Alexandra Burke, Joe McElderry, Little Mix and James Arthur, and finalists One Direction, JLS, Olly Murs, Union J, Amelia Lily, Cher Lloyd and Misha B. However, fans questioned the absence of successful contestants Diana Vickers and Rebecca Ferguson, and winners Steve Brookstein, Leon Jackson and Matt Cardle were also not included. Cardle's manager Will Talbot said that he believed the show was \"attempting to erase Matt from the history books. [...] In truth, it pretty much sums up Syco's attitude to him during the months after he inconveniently (for them) won the show. Unfortunately there is a misconception that Matt has slagged off the show and fallen out with Sony but this is not true.\" Cardle later described being omitted from the advert as \"disappointing\", especially for fans who would have liked to have seen him in it. Melanie C, who has collaborated with Cardle, was more critical, saying: \"I think it's really f**king rude the way they have left him out.\"\n\n\n==== Format changes ====\nThe change to the format of the auditions was criticised by Alex Fletcher from entertainment news website Digital Spy, who said he could not see the logic in having auditions broadcast on both Saturdays and Sundays, as complaints from series 9 were not about needing extra auditions, but about \"dour judges\" and \"underwhelming finalists\". He praised the return of the audition room but felt that \"the producers and [Simon] Cowell evidently weren't confident in the format change and have kept the arena auditions as an extra second round,\" stating that the Bootcamp stage of the competition could have been used to show \"how the acts cope under pressure with a live audience,\" adding that \"the Sunday show feels like a bit of a formality\" and \"generally the singers who stun us on Saturday will impress again on Sunday.\" He said that \"the extra Sunday helping of The X Factor will still rate much higher than anything else that was going to air in that slot for ITV. So for the bean counters and X Factor PR machine it will probably be labelled a hit. In the long-term, however, I fear this 'Supersized X Factor' may lead some viewers to reach for their remotes suffering from reality TV fatigue.\"\nAdditionally, Fletcher was critical of the format change to bootcamp, saying \"The show can be cruel for those taking part, brutal for those who don't make the grade, and its fickleness is nothing compared to the harsh realities of the music industry. However, the argument that 'the music industry is meaner' fell apart this week. [...] I refuse to believe that anyone in the music industry has even been given a contract, told they're brilliant and then forced to watch 15 other people sing and have that contract ripped up in front of their faces. And even if they have, I bet they didn't have an audience of 4,000 people chanting at them to be on their way. This was reality TV at its most cruel.\" He wondered if the change was a \"desperate attempt to create interest in a series that has performed solidly in the ratings, but without creating any real talking points or memorable moments\", and said that \"watching Karen Harding, Lydia Lucy and Sheena McHugh get put into the Top 6 and then have the dream of a spot at Judges' Houses snatched away from them felt needlessly mean. Whether the trio deserved to make Judges' Houses or not felt irrelevant. The audience finger-pointing and the chanting of 'Swap! Swap! Swap!' made the whole process terribly ugly.\" He questioned the show's producers' \"need to make it even more vicious\", opined that the new twist \"definitely undermines the credibility of the show's judges\", and said, \"The whole twist felt contrived and unpleasant, and I hope it won't be returning in 2014.\"\nFans and viewers of the show also criticised the bootcamp format, with some viewers said to be fearing for the contestants' wellbeing, with one calling it \"blood sport\". Singer Lily Allen, who watched the show, said, \"When did become alright to f*** with people's minds. X Factor has got fully mean.\" Contestant Lydia Lucy, who was initially chosen to be in Scherzinger's final six but was replaced by Abi Alton, said, \"It still hasn't sunk in. I've been absolutely devastated. [...] If Simon Cowell was in front of me now I'd tell him to change the format back to how it was. This way is like dangling a carrot in front of someone and then taking it away.\"\nThe new \"flash vote\" twist during the live shows was met negatively by Lorna Simpson, who was the first contestant to be eliminated. Simpson said it was unfair that she had far less time to prepare than fellow sing-off contestant Shelley Smith, claiming \"They set me up to go out in the first week\". It was reported that Cowell was planning to axe the flash vote after The X Factor was heavily beaten by Strictly Come Dancing in the ratings for the second live show. The flash vote was not used in week 4 due to a performance at the start of the show by Nile Rodgers and Chic, and was not used again in week 5. A source from the show said, \"at the moment it is not scheduled to return\". The flash vote was not used again after week 3.\n\n\n==== Contestants ====\nBefore judges' houses, urban act Code 4 had to drop one of their members, Mark Wyman, after it emerged that he had a criminal record, and a spokesman for The X Factor said, \"Unfortunately due to problems in getting a visa Mark was unable to travel to Judges' Houses in America, meaning that he ended up having to leave the band to carry on in the competition as a three piece.\" Code 4 did not make it to the live shows. Three-piece band Rough Copy also had to lose member Kazeem \"Kaz\" Ajobe before the six-chair challenge due to visa problems. The same had happened to the group in series 9, but this year the other two members, Sterling Ramsay and Joey James, continued without Ajobe and advanced to judges' houses as a duo. Fans questioned the events, and the extent to which ITV wanted to resolve them, saying they had a year to get a visa, and Barlow could have stayed in the United Kingdom, the latter sentiment to which Barlow admitted to Ajobe he should've done during the judges' houses episodes. Barlow put Rough Copy through to the live shows and Ajobe was allowed to rejoin the band. Furthermore, just after Ajobe was reinstated, controversy was caused when his criminal past was publicised. Ajobe responded by stating: \"I've done things I am not proud of. I haven't been an angel but I am a changed man now.\"\nThere was criticism over SeSe Foster of Miss Dynamix being allowed to compete in the show, because she was five months pregnant when the live shows began. Some viewers also thought it was unfair that Miss Dynamix got an automatic bye to the next week when Foster collapsed before the second live show. Foster dismissed this, saying that she \"deserve[s] a shot at a better life\" and insisted her collapse was not related to her pregnancy. The following week, Miss Dynamix were eliminated after losing the flash-vote and the sing-off to Hannah Barrett. Following this, Barlow stated that he felt that all public hopes of the group continuing in the competition had ended with their absence in week 2, despite him previously hoping that Foster's collapse would've gained more sympathy for them from the public.\n\n\n==== Judges' comments ====\nSome viewers were shocked by a comment made by Osbourne following 16-year-old Nicholas McDonald's performance of \"She's the One\" during the second live show. As McDonald got to the end of the song, a female backing dancer walked towards him and he kissed her cheek after the song finished. Despite the minimum age of sexual consent in the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies standing at 16, Osbourne then said to McDonald, who was 16 and therefore legal, \"Who on earth was that piece of whatever next to you? That paedophile. You're only 16. You can't be doing that. That's a disgrace ITV.\" She was later spoken to by producers, but Walsh defended her, saying \"She meant nothing wrong by it. We all say things we shouldn't and X Factor is not scripted.\" The dancer declined to comment, but a source close to her said that she was embarrassed by Osbourne's comment.\n\n\n==== Guest performances ====\nOfcom received around 200 complaints about Lady Gaga's performance, including her costume and lyrics, during the third results show on 27 October 2013. ITV received 60 complaints directly. Lady Gaga wore nude-coloured underwear and her lyrics included \"do what you want with my body\". A spokeswoman for ITV said, \"We do not believe Lady Gaga's performance was inappropriate for the family audience of The X Factor results show, which has an established tradition of featuring performances from the biggest music stars. Lady Gaga is well known for her highly individual performance style.\" Ofcom said, \"We will assess all the complaints received on this issue before deciding whether to investigate.\"\nRobin Thicke's performance, which featured a large number of scantily-clad female dancers, also received a total of 317 complaints. On 16 December, both Gaga and Thicke were cleared of any wrongdoing, with an Ofcom spokesman stating, \"We assessed the complaints and concluded there were no grounds to investigate.\"\n\n\n==== Final ====\nThere were technical problems during Sam Bailey's duet performance with Scherzinger, when Jedward's voices could be heard as they completed a microphone test. The duet was panned by viewers who accused Scherzinger of being \"selfish\" by singing the \"best\" lines and notes of the song.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe X Factor",

            "content": "Since the debut of the anime adaptation of Satoshi Tajiri's Pok\u00e9mon Games, Toho has produced the theatrical films based on the franchise since 1998 in Japan: five based on the original series Pok\u00e9mon anime, four based on the Advanced Generation series, four based on the Diamond and Pearl series, with the tenth film commemorating the tenth anniversary of the anime, three based on the Best Wishes series, three based on the XY series, and two based on the new alternate continuity, despite the Sun & Moon series. There are also two television specials that were broadcast on TV Tokyo and ten short films.\nTheatrical films, with little exception, center on and feature Pok\u00e9mon (typically legendary ones) that have yet to officially debut in the games, often with the Pok\u00e9mon causing some sort of disaster with its powers or being pursued by someone with less-than-noble tendencies. Ash and his friends will often befriend a Pok\u00e9mon during the movie and must, at the end, say goodbye to their new friend.\nThe locations in which the movies take place have been, since Pok\u00e9mon Heroes, based on a real-world location outside Japan. Topics explored are typically deeper than those explored in the episodes aired on TV, with the battle between greedy people who would use Pok\u00e9mon for evil and those like Ash who are friends and partners to their Pok\u00e9mon being a central issue in several movies.\nWarner Bros. licensed the first three films in North America, and Miramax Films licensed the following four films. Starting with Pok\u00e9mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, Viz Media is the only North American licensee. Universal Pictures will distribute the live-action adaptation of Detective Pikachu. All Pok\u00e9mon films have been and will be distributed theatrically by Toho within Japan.\n\n\n== Films ==\n\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon: The Original (Series 1) ===\n\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon: Advanced Generation (Series 2) ===\n\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond & Pearl (Series 3) ===\n\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon: Best Wishes! (Series 4) ===\n\n\n=== Pok\u00e9mon: XY (Series 5) ===\n\n\n=== Alternate continuity ===\nOn December 15, 2016, a reboot to the film franchise began with the 20th movie. It was first revealed along with its teaser trailer on the anniversary of the Pok\u00e9mon anime television series. The teaser was also revealed showing Ho-oh (who appeared in the first episode of Pok\u00e9mon). On December 10, 2017, the 21st movie was released along with its teaser trailer. It appears to be a continuation from \"I Choose You!\" involving Lugia and a new character.\n\n\n=== Live-action ===\nThe launch of the Pok\u00e9mon Go app reignited mainstream interest back into the Pok\u00e9mon franchise in the Western market since its initial peak in the early 2000s. In 2016, various Hollywood film companies approached The Pok\u00e9mon Company International to gain film rights. Eventually, Legendary Pictures struck a deal to produce a live-action adaptation of Detective Pikachu, marking it the first official live-action Pok\u00e9mon film.\n\n\n== TV Specials ==\nThese special films, which run longer than the normal half-hour and are not usually separated into more than one episode in either the original or the dub, are often considered TV Pok\u00e9mon movies, not counting towards the running total. They never appear in theaters, but are instead broadcast on the same networks that the regular anime is broadcast for their premieres. Though they may air around the same time as other episodes of the anime, usually in the anime's normal timeslot, they are not assigned episode numbers.\n\n\n== Pikachu Shorts ==\nPikachu shorts are anime shorts that are commonly shown at the start of the Pok\u00e9mon movies, but have also been expanded to fulfill other purposes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPok\u00e9mon anime\nList of Pok\u00e9mon episodes (seasons 1\u201313)\nList of Pok\u00e9mon episodes (seasons 14\u2013current)\nList of Pok\u00e9mon characters\nList of Pok\u00e9mon theme songs\nList of Pok\u00e9mon anime characters\nList of Pok\u00e9mon video games\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Pok\u00e9mon Movies \u2013 US official website\". \n\"Pok\u00e9mon Movies \u2013 JP official website\" (in Japanese).",

            "content": "Mangog is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe character first appeared in Thor #154 (July 1968) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nMangog debuted in a multi-issue storyline in the title Thor, and is depicted as being the sum total of the hatred of \"a billion billion beings\" of a mysterious alien race whose invasion of Asgard had been thwarted by Odin, the ruler of Asgard and the Norse gods. Believed to be the last remaining member of this race and imprisoned beneath Asgard, Mangog is freed by the rock troll Ulik, who sees a warning on the prison door not to release the occupant but does so anyway hoping they will make a useful ally against Asgard. When Mangog is released, he easily defeats Ulik then storms Asgard intent on drawing the Odinsword from its scabbard which will end the universe. Odin's son Thor battles Mangog to a standstill until Odin defeats Mangog by breaking the Odinspell which had created Mangog as a living prison for his entire race. Restoring that race to physical form causes Mangog to fade away, seemingly into nothingness.\nMangog reappears when freed by the god Loki, but was defeated when cut off from the source of its power. Mangog was later aided by the traitorous magician Igron. Mangog assumes the form of an imprisoned Odin, and takes part of each Asgardian's lifeforce, weakening them, and plans to draw the Odinsword. After a series of skirmishes with Thor, the creature is defeated when Thor frees Odin.\nThe character appears in the second volume of Thor as the servant of the Titan Thanos, who is seeking universal domination. Mangog is eventually destroyed by Thor (the character places his mystic hammer Mjolnir in the creature's mouth and blasts it internally) and Thanos (later revealed to have been a clone of Thanos in Infinity Abyss) was defeated. Later, Mangog is again destroyed by Thor, seemingly for good when Thor used the Odinforce to erase him from existence.\nHowever, the Mangog returns in the pages of the Thunderstrike mini-series when he is accidentally summoned by a mystical generator used by megalomaniac Adam Mann. When Thor wonders at his return asserting his previous destruction, the Mangog scornfully replies that hatred can be suppressed or rejected, but never destroyed. He is banished once again where he is cast into the fire of a distant star.\nLater, in The Mighty Thor, during a confrontation between the eponymous heroine and the gods of the Shi'ar, the latter - when vexed by Thor's allies - cause the so-called, and dreaded, \"Ultimate Judgment\" to be unleashed. The feared entity is revealed to be the Mangog, whose fury is stated to be unstoppable.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nMangog possesses the strength, stamina, durability and endurance of a \"billion billion beings\", considerably exceeding that of Thor, and has the ability to manipulate magic for energy projection and shapeshifting.\nHe appears to be immortal and ultimately indestructible, existing so long as hatred does, and indeed draws strength from hate itself, even that of his enemies.\n\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n\n=== Marvel Fanfare ===\nIn an alternate universe story in the title Marvel Fanfare, Mangog battles the Herald of Galactus, Silver Surfer.\n\n\n=== What If? ===\nIn the What If? story \"What if Jane Foster Found the Hammer of Thor?\", Thordis (Foster) and Don Blake are taken to Asgard by Sif to help stop Mangog's attempt to destroy the universe. Thordis ultimately stops him by summoning a storm that revives Odin from the Odinsleep, allowing him to dispatch Mangog.\n\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nIn the Ultimate Marvel universe, Mangog appears in Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man #150, a story which is being told by Thor to the Ultimates about Spider-Man's heroism. Here, Mangog is a mortal sorcerer named Xandu who breaks into a museum and steals the lost eye of Avalon which transforms him into Mangog. Mangog is then defeated by Spider-Man and Thor and then reverts to a mortal.\n\n\n== In other media ==\n\n\n=== Television ===\nMangog appears in the Avengers Assemble episode \"All-Father's Day\", voiced by JB Blanc. He has a history with Odin, who had barred him from entering Asgard. Upon finding out that Odin is on Earth, Mangog interrupts Odin's duel with the Avengers in order to take revenge on Odin. Odin manages to hold his own against Mangog until he managed to knock Odin down. Mangog then takes Odin's Gungir in order to combine it with his own weapon. Thor and the rest of the Avengers had to work to disarm Mangog of his weapon. Once that was done, Odin reclaims Gungir and has Heimdall open a portal to send Mangog to another location. Before disappearing into the portal, Mangog still plans to get revenge on Odin.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nMangog is featured in the Thor: God of Thunder video game (which takes place before the events of the 2011 Thor film) voiced simultaneously by Steven Blum, Robin Atkin Downes, Mitch Lewis, Lisa Moncure, and Mari Weiss. It is revealed that Odin once created Mangog and bound him with Scabrite chains to prevent him from destroying anything else than what his will tells him. His chains broke free and the creature devoured the souls of the Vanir. Loki tricks Thor into releasing Mangog from his imprisonment as part of a plan to discredit his brother, but he is forced to help Thor return to Asgard when his own plan to destroy Mangog fails. Having defeated Mangog's invading allies to deprive him of the hatred that empowers him, Thor fights against Mangog with while Odin strikes Mangog with spears to damage his armor. As the fight concludes, Odin allows the souls that empowered Mangog to pass on to their reward and peace in the afterlife.\nMangog appears in Thor: The Dark World - The Official Game, voiced by Chris Phillips and Marc Thompson.\n\n\n=== Board games ===\nMangog was included in the superhero-featuring board game Heroclix in 2017 as part of The Mighty Thor set of the collectible miniatures game.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nMangog at the Marvel Universe wiki\nMangog at marvel.wikia\nMangog at immortalthor.net",

Initially for men under age 19, this limit was maintained until the 7th championship, hosted by Peru in 1975. Since the 8th edition (1977), when the tournament took place in Venezuela for the second time, the age limit was raised to 20. This change was made in order to use the competition as South American qualification for the FIFA World Youth Championship (now renamed the FIFA U-20 World Cup), held every two years since 1977. The most recent edition (number 28) was hosted by Ecuador and won by Uruguay in 2017.\nThe Championship has had only five champions during its history (Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay). However, since 1983, Brazil has largely dominated the tournament, sharing the trophy only on three occasions with Colombia and on four occasions with Argentina.\n\n\n== Format ==\nAll matches take place in the host country, and all ten U-20 national football teams of CONMEBOL compete in every edition (if none of the associations withdraw). They are separated in two groups of five, and each team plays four matches in a pure round-robin stage. The three top competitors advance to a single final group of six, wherein each team plays five matches. The results in this last pure round-robin stage determines the champion and the South American qualification to the next FIFA U-20 World Cup.

            "content": "Stephanolepis hispidus, the planehead filefish, is a species of bony fish, a ray-finned fish in the family Monacanthidae.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe planehead filefish grows to a maximum length of 27 centimetres (11 in) but is more typically about 17 centimetres (6.7 in) long. The colour is cryptic, being a more or less mottled pale brown, olive or green on a light coloured background, sometimes with darker brown splotches and streaks. The fish is laterally compressed and deep bodied. The snout is elongated with a terminal mouth. The large yellow eye is set high on the head and above it is a prominent retractable spine. This is the anterior of the 2 spines associated with the long dorsal fin, which also has 29 to 35 soft rays. The anal fin has no spines and between 30 and 35 soft rays. The pectoral fins are small and the tail fin is large and fan-shaped, often with two darker coloured bands.\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe planehead filefish is found in the Atlantic Ocean at depths of up to 300 metres (980 ft). Its range extends from Nova Scotia to Uruguay in the west and from the Canary Islands to Angola in the east. It is found near the seabed on reefs and over sandy and muddy sea floors. It is often found among Sargassum seaweed.\n\n\n== Biology ==\nIn the Canary Islands the growth and ageing of the planehead filefish have been studied. Spawning takes place in the summer and the age of the fish is established by using the fast and slow growth rings found in the anterior dorsal fin spine. The species has a lifespan of about three years and reaches half its final length by the end of its first year.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nThe planehead filefish can be used for human consumption. In the Canary Islands it is caught in fish traps and at one time was considered to be a by-catch, incidental to the capture of other, more desirable fish. However, since the 1980s, it has become a target species in its own right and by 2000, there were concerns about overfishing.\n\n\n== References ==",

Jamie Ford, the former chief executive of Plusnet, runs BT IT Services.\nOne of the buildings on the site is called the New Wave Building.\n\n\n=== Display screen ===\nThe site has a large display screen, built by Synelec (bought by Planar Systems), made from 140 composite screens. The screen is ten feet high, and seventy feet wide.\n\n\n== Function ==\nThe site is the home of the UK's speaking clock. BT IT Services, headquartered at Barlborough in Derbyshire on the A616, have a main operation in the building.\nIt monitors network traffic on BT's network across the UK, including 0800, 0845 and 999 numbers. It monitors televotes provide by RIDE (Recorded Information Distribution Equipment). RIDE is accessed via the SOAP protocol.\nAt peak periods it implements call gapping load control. BT Wholesale controls its traffic from the site.\nEvery two minutes the site contacts around 700 of BT's telephone exchanges to find out how busy they are. 80% of BT's network consists of optical fibre.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInstitute of Telecommunications Professionals\nTelecommunications in the United Kingdom\nCategory:Network performance\nErlang distribution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBT IT Services\nIndependent October 2011",

            "content": "Trifluorotoluene is an organic compound with the formula of C6H5CF3. This colorless fluorocarbon is used as a specialty solvent in organic synthesis and an intermediate in the production of pesticides and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n== Synthesis ==\nFor small-scale laboratory preparations, trifluorotoluene is synthesized by coupling an aromatic halide and trifluoromethyl iodide in the presence of a copper catalyst:\nPhX + CF3I \u2192 PhCF3 (where X = I, Br)\nIndustrial production is done via reacting benzotrichloride with hydrogen fluoride in a pressurized reactor.\nPhCCl3 + 3 HF \u2192 PhCF3 + 3 HCl\n\n\n== Uses ==\nTrifluorotoluene has a variety of niche uses.\n\n\n=== Low toxicity alternative to dichloromethane ===\nAccording to Ogawa and Curran, trifluorotoluene is similar to dichloromethane in standard acylation, tosylation, and silylation reactions. The dielectric constants for dichloromethane and trifluorotoluene are 9.04 and 9.18, respectively, indicating similar solvating properties. Dipole moments compare less favorably: 1.89 and 2.86 D for dichloromethane and trifluorotoluene, respectively. Replacing dichloromethane is advantageous when conditions require higher boiling solvents since trifluorotoluene boils 62 \u00b0C higher than dichloromethane (b.p. 40 \u00b0C).\nAs a solvent, trifluorotoluene is useful in mild Lewis-acid catalyzed reactions, such as the Friedel-Crafts preparations. The most common catalyst, aluminium trichloride reacts with trifluorotoluene at room temperature; however, zinc chloride does not.\n\n\n=== Synthetic intermediate ===\nA second and perhaps more valuable use of trifluorotoluene is as a synthetic intermediate. A derivative of trifluorotoluene, 3-aminobenzotrifluoride, is the precursor to the herbicide fluometuron. It is synthesized via nitration followed by reduction to meta-H2NC6H4CF3. This aniline is then converted to the urea.\nFlumetramide (6-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]morpholin-3-one), a skeletal muscle relaxant, is also prepared from trifluorotoluene.\n\n\n== Analytics ==\nTrifluorotoluene appears in 19F NMR as a singlet at -63.2 ppm.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Alan Anthony Wiggins (February 17, 1958 \u2013 January 6, 1991) was an American professional baseball player. He was a second baseman and outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres and Baltimore Orioles between 1981 and 1987. A speedy leadoff hitter, Wiggins had his best season with the pennant-winning Padres in 1984. He batted one slot in the lineup ahead of Tony Gwynn that year, and the pair's offensive production helped the Padres win the National League Championship Series (NLCS) and advance to the World Series.\nWiggins grew up in California and attended Pasadena City College before being drafted by the California Angels in 1977. He played in the minor league systems of the Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers, setting a professional baseball single-season record with 120 stolen bases in 1980. He made his major league debut with the San Diego Padres in 1981, and he became a regular player within two years. In 1983 he set the Padres' single-season stolen base record, a mark that he extended the following season. His 1984 stolen bases total (70) is still a team record as of 2017.\nDuring his major league career, Wiggins struggled with drug addiction, which resulted in several arrests and suspensions from baseball. His drug problems prompted a 1985 trade from San Diego to Baltimore, where Wiggins spent three seasons. After leaving baseball, he was diagnosed with AIDS, and he was the first MLB player known to die of the disease. Long after his death, two of his children, Candice and Alan, Jr., became professional basketball players.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWiggins was born in Los Angeles, California, and his mother, Karla Wiggins, raised him as a single parent. As a child, he played baseball with his friends at a park across from the Rose Bowl, and he was a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and their base-stealing shortstop, Maury Wills. Wiggins graduated from John Muir High School in Pasadena, California, which was also the alma mater of Dodgers star Jackie Robinson. Gib Bodet, a scout for the Montreal Expos, noticed Wiggins in high school. Wiggins was 6 feet 2 inches (188 cm) tall, which was taller than a typical infielder. He was only an average hitter and fielder, but his speed stood out to Bodet.\nThe California Angels selected Wiggins as the eighth overall pick of the January 1977 MLB amateur draft. In 1977 Wiggins played junior college baseball at Pasadena City College, where he was a teammate of future major leaguers Matt Young and Rod Booker. Bodet, who had moved to the Angels scouting staff just before the draft, joined other Angels staff members and worked out with Wiggins after the team selected him. Angels coach Bob Clear told Wiggins that his excellent speed would help him to a high batting average even if his hitting skills were not that strong: \"If you can hit .200, you can run the other eighty points. And if you can hit .280, you can lead off for anybody.\" Wiggins signed with the Angels in May for $2,500 after what Bodet described as \"a tough negotiation\". According to Bodet, Wiggins' mother \"did not trust easily\".\n\n\n== Baseball career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nWiggins played minor league baseball in 1977 for the Angels rookie-league affiliate in Idaho Falls, where he hit .271 and had 25 stolen bases in 63 games. In 1978, with the Class A Quad Cities Angels, Wiggins stole 26 bases in 49 games, but his batting average fell to .201. Following a mid-season fight with one of his coaches, he was released by the Angels organization in June 1978. Wiggins feared that his career was near its end, but he reached out to Los Angeles Dodgers scout Gail Henley. After a workout in front of the Dodgers and manager Tommy Lasorda, Wiggins signed with the team before the 1979 season, receiving an invitation to spring training and then being assigned to the team's Class A affiliate, the Clinton Dodgers.\nIn 95 games for Clinton, Wiggins hit .257, stole 43 bases, and converted to a shortstop after spending the previous two seasons as a second baseman. He also appeared in the outfield and at all three of the other infield positions for Clinton. Playing with the Class A Lodi Dodgers of the California League in 1980, Wiggins batted .288 and scored 108 runs while stealing 120 bases in just 135 games. He established a professional baseball single-season steals record, surpassing the previous minor league mark of 116 set by Allan Lewis in 1966, as well as Lou Brock's major league record of 118 in 1974.\nAfter the 1980 season, Wiggins' fourth year in the minor leagues, he was eligible to be selected by other teams in that year's Rule 5 draft.The Rule 5 draft is a procedure that stops teams from hoarding young players in the minor leagues when those players might be able to make it to the major leagues with other organizations. A team can protect a player from the Rule 5 draft by adding him to its major league roster. The Dodgers decided not to protect Wiggins, and since he had once caught the eye of San Diego Padres general manager Jack McKeon, the Padres selected him in the draft. Padres officials later said that they knew Wiggins had been arrested for possession of marijuana while with the Dodgers. \"It was known in our organization that he had a problem in the Dodger organization. They didn't want a part of it,\" Padres manager Dick Williams said.\n\n\n=== San Diego Padres ===\nAfter having spent most of his minor league career as an infielder, he was used almost exclusively as an outfielder with the Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League in 1981. He batted .302 with 73 steals, and received a September call-up to the major leagues as an outfielder. In his first stint with the Padres, he got five hits in 14 at bats. Wiggins began the following season with the Islanders, but he was called up again by the Padres in early May to replace injured outfielder Gene Richards. Wiggins was leading San Diego with 29 stolen bases in 59 games when he was arrested for possession of cocaine in July. He was issued a 30-day suspension from baseball, and spent a month in a substance abuse treatment facility. The Padres, who were one of the first sports teams to offer an employee assistance program to players, paid for all of his treatment, and he returned to the team in September. By 1983 Wiggins had become a regular in the Padres lineup, batting in the leadoff spot and playing in the outfield for most of the season. He was exceptional on defense in left field, hit .276 and stole 66 bases. He was moved to first base for the last 45 games of the year after Steve Garvey suffered a broken thumb. Wiggins' stolen bases total broke the single-season team record of 61 set by Richards in 1980. Wiggins was named the team's most valuable player that season.\nWiggins was moved to second base in 1984, making room for rookie Carmelo Mart\u00ednez in the outfield. Until that season, Mart\u00ednez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, and they wanted to get Mart\u00ednez into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins retained the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying a National League (NL) record. In August, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights when he was hit with the first pitch of a game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual P\u00e9rez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs, and the tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.\n\nOn the season, Wiggins scored 106 runs, stole 70 bases and led the league with 391 putouts. His stolen bases total stood as a Padres single-season record as of the end of the 2017 season. Benefitting from the higher number of fastballs opposing pitchers threw in response to Wiggins' speed, Gwynn batted above .400 when his speedy teammate was on base, and hit .351 overall for the first of his eight career batting titles. The duo was one of the biggest reasons behind San Diego's success. The team could score quickly with Wiggins getting on first, stealing second, and scoring on a hit by Gwynn. Wiggins batted .316 in the 1984 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, going two-for-three with two runs scored in the fifth and deciding game. In the 1984 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, which the Padres lost in five games, Wiggins batted .364 and scored twice. His eight hits were the most of any Padres player in the series. According to manager Dick Williams, Wiggins was \"absolutely the most valuable player in the National League in 1984\". \"Alan Wiggins' role in bringing San Diego the 1984 National League championship wasn't put into proper perspective until the Padres tried to defend their title without him,\" sportswriter Phil Collier later wrote.\nBefore the 1985 season, the Padres signed Wiggins to a four-year contract extension worth nearly $3 million. His agent described him as one of the highest-paid NL second basemen. Wiggins missed the last two weeks of spring training after injuring his knee during a double-play attempt on defense when a baserunner slid into him. He was unavailable for the start of the season, but returned to the lineup after being out for five games. Wiggins was batting .054 and was without a stolen base two weeks into the season when he was suspended by the Padres following a relapse into cocaine dependency. After Wiggins completed a drug rehabilitation program, the Padres did not want to reactivate him, but baseball's joint review board cleared him to return to play. In June, Donald Fehr of the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) announced that he intended to file a grievance against the Padres if they did not promptly activate Wiggins. The Padres sought to trade Wiggins and the Baltimore Orioles showed interest, but as the trade deadline approached, the Orioles were reportedly only offering two minor league players in exchange for him.\nOn June 27, 1985, Wiggins was traded to the Orioles for pitchers Roy Lee Jackson and Richard Caldwell. Padres owner Joan Kroc said that the team had warned Wiggins that he would not remain with the team if he had further problems with drugs. She stated that it would have been self-serving to keep Wiggins after his relapse when he could instead pursue a fresh start with another team. Nonetheless, Gwynn felt that Wiggins had been shortchanged by the Padres.\n\n\n=== Baltimore Orioles ===\nWiggins spent a few days in the minor leagues before being called up to Baltimore. In his first game with the Orioles, he started at second base and was the team's leadoff hitter, reaching base three times, driving in a run and scoring a run. After the game, Wiggins commented that he felt welcome on the team and did not feel like he was starting out with anything to prove. In 76 games for Baltimore that year, he hit .285, scored 43 runs and finished eighth in the American League with 30 stolen bases. Baltimore fans felt that Wiggins was lazy, as he often stopped running to first base on ground balls and showed a lack of effort on defense. He spent much of his time alone and did not talk to his teammates for much of the season.\nWiggins later said that he had been depressed because he missed his wife and children, who were still living in San Diego. His family moved to a suburb of Baltimore before the 1986 season, but Wiggins still struggled to win over Orioles fans and teammates. When the team asked him to field extra ground balls during spring training, he complied but did so sluggishly. Later in the year, he angered Cal Ripken Jr. when he threw a bat in frustration and the bat struck Ripken in the dugout. In June, Wiggins was tagged out with the hidden ball trick, and he made three errors the next day, including two in the same inning. After the two-error inning, Baltimore fans booed as his picture was revealed on the scoreboard during a \"Who Am I\" feature at the ballpark. Wiggins was frustrated by the fan response because he had relatives at the game that day. Manager Earl Weaver understood why Wiggins was upset over the timing of the scoreboard feature, but he said that Wiggins \"had more chances than anyone who ever wore an Orioles' uniform\". He batted .251 with 21 stolen bases and 30 runs scored, played only 71 games, and was reassigned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings at one point in the season.\nThe following season, Cal Ripken Sr. replaced Weaver as manager of the Orioles. Baltimore signed Rick Burleson to play second base and Ray Knight to play third base. The moves seemed to leave Wiggins battling for an outfield spot, but after he hit .413 during spring training, Ripken suggested that he might use Wiggins as a utility player. Just before the season started, Wiggins said he was not happy with Ripken's idea of using him in a utility role, feeling that his spring performance should have secured him a starting position. He believed that he could be an asset in the leadoff batting slot.\nAt the start of the 1987 regular season, Wiggins spent some time as a designated hitter (DH) and shared second base duties with Burleson. Rookie second baseman Billy Ripken joined the club on July 10. Burleson was cut, but general manager Hank Peters said, \"We're not bringing [Billy Ripken] up here to sit on the bench.\" Wiggins was hitting .242 on July 10, and he played mostly DH after the rookie's arrival. In early August, Wiggins received a three-day suspension after he got into an altercation with teammate Jim Dwyer and grabbed the shirt of Ripken Sr.\nOn September 1 MLB indefinitely suspended Wiggins for a behavior issue, and an anonymous Orioles official told the media that the suspension resulted from a positive drug screen. Wiggins was released from the Orioles on September 29 and the team had to pay him two-thirds of his $800,000 salary for 1988. MLBPA officials announced that they would not issue grievances related to Wiggins' suspension and subsequent release, noting that Wiggins wanted to be released by that point.\n\n\n== Later years ==\n\nThough Wiggins did not give up hope for a return to baseball, he began to study the real estate market after his suspension from the game. In the late 1980s Wiggins started to suffer from health difficulties related to AIDS, though the diagnosis was not publicly disclosed while he was alive. He was receiving deferred payments from his baseball career, and he began to make plans for the financial future of his children. He told one of his former teammates that he was getting into computer work. Gwynn said that he had seen Wiggins in the spring of 1990 and was struck by his visible weight loss.\nIn his final months, he sold his home in Poway, California, and moved to Pasadena. Though he often stayed with friends, some of his longtime friends felt that he died in seclusion, embarrassed by what had happened with his life. In November 1990 Wiggins was hospitalized with pneumonia and tuberculosis at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Wiggins stated that he had contracted HIV via intravenous drug use. After lapsing in and out of consciousness for a month, he died at the hospital on January 6, 1991.\nWiggins' family initially attributed his death to lung cancer that had led to respiratory failure. Family members said that he had gotten sick with a cough and that his condition had worsened quickly. Wiggins weighed under 75 pounds at the time of his death. Several days after Wiggins died, a physician disclosed that his health problems were complications of AIDS. He became the first baseball player known to have died from AIDS.\nAfter Wiggins died, longtime Oriole Frank Robinson said, \"He was a very bright individual, and you could like the guy. But there was always something there to back you off.\" Former Padres player Garry Templeton said that he might have been Wiggins' closest friend, but said that he did not know that Wiggins had been ill. Wiggins is buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nWiggins met his wife Angela when they were in junior high school, and they both graduated from John Muir High School. The Los Angeles Times reported that Wiggins had experienced marital strife, but that he would not entertain the thought of divorce; he wanted to ensure that his children did not grow up in a single-parent household as he had. Two of Wiggins' three children became professional basketball players. Candice, an All-American at Stanford University, joined the Minnesota Lynx as the third overall pick in the 2008 WNBA draft. She has served as a spokesperson for the Greater Than AIDS campaign. Alan Jr. played at the University of San Francisco and played professionally in several countries. His oldest daughter, Cassandra, played college basketball at New York University.\nWiggins and his mother were very close, and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease diagnosis may have contributed to his drug problems. He was devastated that she would not be able to enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.\nThe Orioles once gave an IQ test, and Wiggins scored higher than everyone except for Weaver. Wiggins' agent, Tony Attanasio, said that Wiggins' intelligence had caused problems in his relationships with teammates. He said that Wiggins had always been reserved and had a difficult time trusting other people. Wiggins enjoyed stubbornly engaging in debates with his teammates, particularly Padres pitcher Eric Show, just to provoke reactions from them. He liked to read books and newspapers, and his teammates were turned off by these displays of his intellect. According to Attanasio, players in Baltimore also resented Wiggins because he replaced Rich Dauer, who had been a well-liked member of the team. Lee Lacy was one of Wiggins' few friends on the Orioles. Tony Gwynn suggested that Wiggins was sometimes misunderstood. \"To not like Alan Wiggins, is to not know Alan Wiggins,\" Gwynn said.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nCareer statistics and player information from MLB, or ESPN, or Baseball-Reference, or Fangraphs, or The Baseball Cube, or Baseball-Reference (Minors), or Retrosheet, or Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Winter League)",

            "content": "Dame Alice Owen's School (usually known as Dame Alice Owen's or simply as Owen's; referred to by the acronym DAOS) is a partially selective secondary school and sixth form with academy status located in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire in southern England. The school was founded in Islington as a boys' school for 30 students in 1613, which makes the school one of the oldest in the United Kingdom, and is named after its founder, the 17th-century philanthropist Alice Owen. Over time, the boys' school expanded. A girls' school was built in 1886, and the two schools were merged in 1973; the mixed school moved to its current location in stages between 1973 and 1976.\nThere are 1466 students aged 11 to 18 at the school; the school is entirely co-educational, and therefore contains roughly equal numbers of boys and girls (as of January 2017, there are 720 boys and 745 girls at the school). The school's first headmaster was William Leske, who held the position from 1613 to 1614. Its present headteacher is Hannah Nemko, who has held the position since 2016 and is the fifth headteacher of the mixed school in Potters Bar. The trustees of the Dame Alice Owen Foundation are the Worshipful Company of Brewers.\nThe school is consistently one of the highest performing state schools in England and Wales in terms of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and GCE Advanced Level (A-Level) results, and is widely considered one of the best schools in the United Kingdom. The Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) rated it outstanding in all areas in 2009. In 2016, it was named the State Secondary School of the Year by The Sunday Times in the newspaper's rankings for the 2016\u201317 school year, and Tatler and The Daily Telegraph have also strongly praised it. Dame Alice Owen's School is one of the most oversubscribed schools in the UK, with over 600 more applicants than places (in 2013).\nDame Alice Owen's School offers a wide range of extracurricular activities for the pupils that attend it, such as sport and music. Many pupils take part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award and school trips, for example to the Galapagos Islands or CERN. The school has a number of notable alumni, many of whom still retain ties to the school, such as the musician Gary Kemp and the film director Sir Alan Parker. Former pupils are referred to as Old Owenians.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation: pre\u20131613 ===\n\nDame Alice Owen's School was founded in 1613 by the English philanthropist Alice Owen (n\u00e9e Wilkes; 1547 \u2013 26 November 1613). Owen decided to found a school to thank God for saving her when she was a child after she narrowly avoided being struck by an arrow, which passed through her hat, in the fields in Islington.\nThe death of her third husband (the judge Thomas Owen) in 1598 caused Alice Owen to be free to carry out her plans. On 6 June 1608, she acquired a licence to purchase 11 acres (4.5 hectares) of ground in Islington and Clerkenwell, on which to build a hospital for 10 poor widows, and to confer power over that land (and some other land; in total, it was worth \u00a340 a year) to the Worshipful Company of Brewers (her first husband, Henry Robinson, had been a member of the company). The site had been called the \"Hermitage\" field. In 1609, Owen officially gave authority over the charity she had founded to the Brewers' Company; by indentures dated in that year, she had given the company an annual payment of \u00a325 to support her almshouses.\nAfter founding the almshouses in 1608 on the site, which was on the east side of St John Street, in 1610 Owen obtained the right to build a school and chapel in the same location. Three iron arrows were fixed into a gable in the building, to commemorate the time when she was almost hit by an arrow; Owen also erected a free chapel there. On 20 September 1613, she made rules for her school (and the almshouses); notably, the school was to take thirty boys \u2013 twenty-four from Islington and six from Clerkenwell \u2013 and be inspected by the Brewers' Company once a year.\nThe rules also stated that the school's headmaster was to be paid five pounds every three months and be given a house to live in for free; he was to teach writing, mathematics and bookkeeping. Her will (which was dated 10 June 1613), directed the yearly purchase of land worth \u00a320 in order to pay the headmaster's salary. The first man to hold the position was William Leske, who held the position until 1614 before resigning. Samuel Lewis Jnr writes that according to John Stow's Survey of London, building the school and almshouses, as well as purchasing the land, cost \u00a31776. To provide her charity with an income, the executor of Owen's will, Sir Thomas Rich, bought a 41-acre (17-hectare) farm in Orsett in Essex for \u00a322.\nThe school has maintained many traditions from the time of its founding, such as the giving of a small amount of \"beer money\" to every pupil. The gift is now a limited-edition five-pound coin in mint condition, having previously been beer, a reminder of the school's long-standing close association with the brewing industry and the Worshipful Company of Brewers. Arrows feature prominently on the school's crest, which is in itself largely identical to the crest of the Worshipful Company of Brewers; other motifs on the school's logo include barrels and hops.\n\n\n=== Early years and expansion: 1613\u20131886 ===\n\nWilliam Smith, who held the position of headmaster between 1666 and 1678, was dismissed because of alleged involvement in the Popish Plot.\nIn 1818, the Charity Commission found that there were 55 boys at the school \u2013 the 30 specified by Owen, and 25 private pupils (several of whom boarded with Alexander Balfour, who served as headmaster from 1791 to 1824). Only the private pupils learned French and Latin (the other children had the opportunity to learn Latin, but none took it). At the time, the headmaster earned \u00a330 a year. The value of the trust estates in Islington and Clerkenwell had grown to \u00a3900 a year by 1830. The school and almshouses were rebuilt in 1841 on a new site in Owen Street, Islington (near their previous location), at a cost of about \u00a36,000; this was done because the old buildings had fallen into disrepair. The original structures were demolished in 1841 to make space for a playground; the headteacher at this time was John Hoare, who held the post between 1833 and 1879. In 1842, there were 85 boys attending the school \u2013 one-fifth (17) of them were from Clerkenwell while four-fifths (68) were from Islington \u2013 though the new school was intended to be for 120 boys. That number of pupils had been reached by 1865, when there were 100 boys from Islington and 20 from Clerkenwell at the school (all aged 7\u201314).\nA new project received royal assent on 14 August 1878; this scheme enabled the school to expand into two schools \u2013 one for 300 boys, and the other for that many girls. The girls' school was opened in Owen's Row in 1886; its first headmistress was Emily Armstrong. The boys' school was expanded further in 1895 so that 420 boys could go there.\n\n\n=== Boys' and girls' schools in Islington: 1886\u20131973 ===\nThe schools were evacuated to Bedford during the Second World War, in which the schools' buildings were badly damaged. The girls' school was mostly destroyed by bombing in 1940 and had to be rebuilt; on 15 October 1940, around 150 people were sheltering in the basement of the girls' school when a parachute mine hit the building, causing a pipe to flood the basement and killing most of the occupants. A new building was erected in the early 1960s, replacing temporary buildings. Dame Alice Owen's School achieved voluntary aided status in 1951. There were over 600 boys at the boys' school in 1963, of whom more than 100 were students in the school's sixth form. The main buildings of the boys' and girls' schools facing each other across the boys' school playground, were located in Goswell Road, Islington, and were merged as a single school in 1973. The school moved to its current location in the 1970s, with pupils being transferred in stages between 1973 and 1976 (when the process finished).\n\n\n=== Comprehensive school in Potters Bar: 1976\u2013present ===\nIn July 1976, the school finished relocating to Potters Bar, Hertfordshire. The former boys' school building has now been demolished, but the girls' school building is now part of the City and Islington College. On 2 November 1990, the Duke of Edinburgh visited the school. On 25 November 1997, the Princess Anne opened a new languages centre. Earlier the same year, Arsenal Football Club tried to place a group of its talented youngsters at the school, with a \u00a3250,000 'gift', but the school refused, saying it would not drop its academic standards, even though George Graham's children went to the school. The Arsenal Youth Team eventually went to Highams Park School. The school offers a wide range of sports for students, including football, gymnastics, rugby and athletics.\n\n\n==== 400th Anniversary (2013) ====\n\nTo commemorate the school's quartecentenary in 2013, the school's 400th Anniversary Committee, headed by the musician Gary Kemp, an Old Owenian, i.e. former student (his band Spandau Ballet performed their first gig in the dining room of the school in Potters Bar), set up events for the whole school community to take part. A 1-by-2-metre (3.3-by-6.6-foot) cake was made at the school for all the staff, students and parents to share, to mark the beginning of the year's celebrations. The film director and producer Sir Alan Parker (also an Old Owenian) directed a Celebration Concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 23 April 2013, with the school's Concert Band, Symphony and Chamber Orchestras, Junior and Senior Soul Bands, and Junior and Senior Choirs (as well as possible performances by members of Spandau Ballet). A Thanksgiving Service was held at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral on 30 April 2013. In November, the train company First Capital Connect named one of its trains \"Dame Alice Owens 400 years of learning\" to honour the occasion.\nThe programme of various sporting occasions, a specially written drama production and the 400th Summer Ball (on 13 July 2013) which were to take place during the year ended with a carol service at St Albans Cathedral on 16 December 2013. Old Owenians could keep in touch with what was happening by joining the school\u2019s 400th Anniversary email list, to which over 3 300 alumni signed up (they received quarterly newsletters).\nIn conjunction with the celebrations, a 400th Anniversary Appeal was set up to raise \u00a31 million towards a new science building for the school. It was launched in February 2011 in an event at Portcullis House, Westminster, with Lord Robert Winston (the keynote speaker) and Dr Alan Davison (who was the school's headteacher at that time) joined Edward Guinness (CVO), James Clappison MP (Member of Parliament) and Emily Thornberry MP in outlining the school\u2019s new project. Patrons included Lord Lingfield, Sir Alan Parker and Sir Terry Leahy; David J. C. MacKay, Chief Scientific Advisor to the Department of Energy and Climate Change also supported the project and endorsed the school\u2019s commitment to providing outstanding facilities for students studying science. The appeal's chairman was Gary Kemp, who said the school needed \"help to continue to support those talented students who will be the scientists of tomorrow\". In 2014, Lord Winston unveiled the new block.\n\n\n=== List of headteachers ===\nThe modern and former boys' and girls' schools have had many headteachers:\n\n\n==== Mixed school in Potters Bar ====\nHannah Nemko, 2016\u2013present\nAlan Davison, 2005\u20132016\nAldon T Williamson, 1994\u20132005\nDavid Bolton, 1982\u20131994\nGerald F Jones, 1973\u20131982 (head of the boys' grammar school in Islington; he became the first head of the partially selective, mixed school in Potters Bar in 1973)\n\n\n==== Mixed school in Islington ====\nRonald C.

The school has appeared in the 2014 Tatler State Schools Guide, where it was highly praised and described as a \"golden ticket for Islington parents\". In 2009, the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) rated it outstanding.\nAround 90 per cent of students enter higher education, with many going to some of the best British universities: in 2016, 14 successfully applied to the University of Oxford or Cambridge (collectively called Oxbridge; the school's record number of successful applications in a single year is 30), and two-thirds of students continue to Russell Group universities. In a 2016 study, Sol Gamsu, a PhD student at King's College London, found that Dame Alice Owen's School acts as a \"de facto feeder school\" for Oxbridge.\nThe school had its first two students attain places on the prestigious Prime Minister's Global Fellowship programme in 2009.\nDame Alice Owen\u2019s School has been a Science Specialist School since 2007 and 43 per cent of students go on to study science at world-class universities. The school holds regular lectures, organised by its science society, for students; worked with Cancer Research last year on a skin cancer project and is building relationships with Imperial College London. The school aimed to attract additional government funding, with over \u00a3250 000 already raised as of October 2011, to support the construction, which finished in 2014.\n\n\n=== Exam results ===\n\n\n==== 2016 ====\nIn 2016, 94% of all Year 11 students secured 5 A*\u2013C grades including English and Maths in their General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams, which was significantly higher than the average for the school's local education authority (80.2%); 68.6% of entries were given grades of A* or A. The school's GCE Advanced Level (A-Level) results were described by the school's headteacher, Hannah Nemko as \"fantastic\"; 94.1% of grades were A*\u2013C, with 82.1% being A*\u2013B and 55% being A*\u2013A.\n\n\n==== 2015 ====\nAt A-Level, 55.5% of grades were A*\u2013A, 80.7% were A*\u2013B and 93.8% were A*\u2013C. 22.9% of grades were A*'s, and 16 pupils secured university places at Oxbridge.\n\n\n==== 2012 ====\nAt GCSE, 94.2% of pupils achieved 5 A*\u2013C grades including English and maths and 96.1% of pupils received 5 A*\u2013C grades without English and maths. 64.5% of entries were graded A*\u2013A (at that time, the school had only performed better than that once), and many pupils only received A* grades. A Level results for that year were also record-breaking.\n\n\n==== 2011 ====\nIn 2011, 93% of all Year 11 students secured 5 A*\u2013C grades including English and Maths. 96% of all Year 11 students secured 5 A*\u2013C grades without English and Maths. 68.1% of all entries were graded A or A* and 32% were graded A*. 82.1% of all grades awarded were A*\u2013B. There was an upward trend with the new A* grade, with 21.3% of all entries being awarded an A*, 32% were awarded an A, making the A* and A total 52.3%. 64 of all students secured straight A*s and As. 99.4% of all entries secured a pass grade. 20 students with offers confirmed their Oxbridge places and the majority of students secured places at their first choice of university. AS results showed a new school record with 54.1% being graded A (44.1% in 2010) and 78% A & B grades (68.9% in 2010).\n\n\n== Admissions ==\nThe school is partially selective by means of an entrance examination; roughly a third of pupils are selected based on academic ability, while others are chosen because of musical skills, having a sibling at the school or living in the school's catchment area (which includes Islington, from where 20 pupils are admitted yearly because the school was previously located there). 200 pupils are admitted to Year 7 annually, 65 of whom enter through the entrance examinations (there are two, which take place on different days \u2013 the first tests verbal reasoning and English and the second tests mathematics) and 10 through a musical aptitude test. Tatler have described the admissions procedure as \"mind-boggling\". The school also allows external applications to its sixth form.\nStudents are drawn from a wide area, and the school is heavily oversubscribed. In 2013, it received 665 more applications than there were places. As of 2016, fewer than a quarter of applications succeed; ten people apply for every place offered to external candidates to the sixth form.\nIn 2006, Alan Davison, the school's headteacher at that time, strongly opposed a plan by the Department for Education and Skills to ban partially selective schools from prioritising applications from the siblings of students attending the school, saying that the proposal threatened the school's \"family-friendly atmosphere\", and also stated that potentially affected schools were obtaining legal advice (the government never implemented the rule) Davison would later (in 2013) criticise Hertfordshire County Council and the government for their alleged lack of response to fraudulent applications (these were for the 22 places at the school available based on residence, and it was claimed that people were renting or buying houses near the school without living in them in order to qualify). He said \"[p]eople will do anything to [obtain a place at the school]\".\n\n\n== Location and school grounds ==\n\nDame Alice Owen's School is situated in the south of Potters Bar, just north of the M25 motorway, and within earshot of South Mimms services, which are near the school (to the west). The school is also close to Bridgefoot Lane. The school grounds have an area of 34 acres (14 hectares) and include a lake and large playing fields. In 2016, the journalist Sue Leonard, writing in The Times, said that the school \"offers...facilities many other secondary schools can only envy\".\nStudents at the school come from a wide area, and the school is served by three Transport for London (TfL) contracted London buses: namely the 626, 692 and 699 (Sullivan Buses operates the routes for TfL). Several other buses, such as the 610 (which is operated by Uno), also stop at the school.

            "content": "Gary Malkowski (born July 26, 1958) is a former Canadian provincial politician. He represented the riding of York East in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 1995, as a member of the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP). He was Canada's first deaf parliamentarian, and the first deaf parliamentarian in the world to address a legislature in a sign language, specifically American Sign Language. He was formerly a table tennis player who went onto represent Canada at the Deaflympics in 1977 and 1985.\n\n\n== Background ==\nBorn in Hamilton, Ontario, Malkowski went to E. C. Drury School for the Deaf, in Milton, Ontario. He was further educated at Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and social work, and a Master of Arts degree in rehabilitation counselling. He was cited in Who's Who in American Universities and Colleges for his work in advancing student rights.\nAfter graduating, he worked as a vocational rehabilitation counsellor and deaf culture instructor for the Canadian Hearing Society, and taught continuing education courses in politics and culture for deaf adults at George Brown College. In 1989, he was presented with a Community Action Award by the Ontario government. On May 13, 2011, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Gallaudet University; he also delivered the commencement address that day.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nThe NDP won a majority government in the 1990 provincial election, and Malkowski defeated Liberal incumbent Christine Hart by 789 votes in the Toronto area riding of York East. When Bob Rae's government took office following the election, the very first law passed was to permit Malkowski's sign language interpreters to stand on the floor of the legislature. Malkowski was named parliamentary assistant to the Elaine Ziemba, Minister of Citizenship on October 1, 1990. Ziemba was also the minister responsible for human rights, the disabled, seniors and race relations.\nIn 1993, Malkowski became parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Education and Training. In 1994, he introduced the Rae government's Ontarians with Disabilities bill, which aimed to improve service accessibility for people with disabilities. Although the bill did not pass, it helped form the basis for the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act which was passed in 2005.\nIn the 1995 election, the governing NDP were reduced to 17 seats, and Malkowski lost to Progressive Conservative John Parker by 3,263 votes.\n\n\n== After politics ==\nHe is now a special advisor to the president of the Canadian Hearing Society. In this role, Malkowski opposed disabilities legislation proposed by the Mike Harris government in 1998 as ineffective.\nIn 2004, Malkowski began a campaign to have major theatre companies install closed-captioning services for deaf patrons. This led to a human rights complaint which was resolved in 2007 when then major theatre companies agreed to install the deaf patron services in their theatres.\n\n\n== Memoirs ==\nAuthor Richard Medugno has published a biography, Deaf Politician: The Gary Malkowski Story and a play, Bigger Dreams, about Malkowski.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOntario Legislative Assembly parliamentary history\nDeaf Politician - The Gary Malkwoski Story by Richard Medugno\nBigger Dreams - A Full-length Play about Gary Malkowski by Richard Medugno",

            "content": "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, (colloquially known as SARPBC, officially abbreviated as SARP Battle-Cars) is a vehicular soccer video game for the PlayStation 3. The game was released in North America in October 2008, and in Europe in February 2009. The campaign mode of the game is made up of a series of varied mini-games, and tournaments against AI which can only be played in single player mode.\nA sequel, titled Rocket League, was released in July 2015.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is played by one or more players, locally or online, using their car to hit a soccer ball that is much larger than the car, with hope to score a goal. Each goal is worth one point, and the team with the most points when 5 minutes have passed wins. If both teams are tied when the timer runs out, the game enters the sudden death overtime mode, which lasts indefinitely until either team scores.\nThere are also many various mini-games and tournaments only available in single player, consisting of situations such as the player being outnumbered by computer-controlled opponents, or objectives such as shooting balls at a goal in a certain amount of time or defending a goal from shots from a cannon. For each completed mini-game or tournament, the player can earn up to 5 stars, depending on how well it was completed, along with various criteria depending on the game in question.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSupersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars received mixed reviews by critics, with a Metacritic score of 67/100. It was downloaded on the PlayStation Network over 2 million times.\n\n\n== Sequel ==\n\nIn March 2011, Psyonix confirmed that there was a sequel in development, but that it was far from completion, and even further from release, due to them having difficulty pitching it to publishers or acquiring the finances required to self-publish.\nIn September 2013, Psyonix announced their plans for the sequel in more detail, saying that there would be a free PC alpha version released for testing and improvement, and to allow buildup of a community, before being ported to consoles. They also confirmed that there was a playable version of the game, and announced what improvements are being made on the game, and new features, compared to the old one.\nOn February 19, 2014 it was confirmed that the sequel would be titled Rocket League. On July 7, 2015, it was released for the PlayStation 4 through the Instant Game Collection on PlayStation Plus, as well as on PC through Steam.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
