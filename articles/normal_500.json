            "content": "Francis Anthony Nixon (December 3, 1878 \u2013 September 4, 1956) was an American businessman and the father of U.S. President Richard Nixon.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nNixon was born in Elk Township, Vinton County, Ohio, the son of Sarah Ann (n\u00e9e Wadsworth), a native of Hocking Township, Fairfield County, Ohio, and Samuel Brady Nixon, who was from Smith Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania. Nixon's family ancestry included colonial Pennsylvania Quakers. He was raised Methodist, however, but converted to Quakerism when he married Hannah Milhous.\nSarah Nixon died in January 1886, Francis being sent to live with an uncle during his father's struggle to remain out of poverty and cope with the loss of Sarah. Samuel remarried, Aitken citing Francis' disliking of his stepmother as his motive for running away. Nixon proceeded to hold multiple jobs over the course of the next fourteen years, the latter being hard working but also favorable of having arguments.\nThroughout his youth, Nixon looked up to U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Ambrose wrote that Nixon ceased favoring the Democratic Party by the age of 17. In the lead up to the 1896 United States presidential election, Nixon had an encounter with presidential candidate William McKinley, who asked him how he was going to vote, Nixon replying, \"Republican, of course!\" Ambrose cited the encounter as completing Nixon's switch to supporting the Republican Party.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNixon moved to California at the turn of the century after having been frostbitten working as a motorman in an open streetcar in Columbus, Ohio. After working as a farmhand and oil roustabout, he attempted to cultivate lemons outside Los Angeles.\nAfter his son Richard was born, Nixon abandoned the lemon grove, and the family moved to the Quaker community of Whittier, California. Nixon focused on the family business, a store that sold groceries and Atlantic Richfield gasoline, but the family remained impoverished. Nixon's life was marked by the deaths of his two sons, Arthur and Harold, from tuberculosis. He has been described as a \"restless, frustrated, and angry man, a mean-spirited person who psychologically abused his five sons and sometimes beat them.\" However, Richard always spoke highly of his parents. He often spoke lovingly of his mother as a \"Quaker saint,\" and began his memoirs with the words \"I was born in a house my father built.\" Writer Jessamyn West, a cousin of the Nixons, was in Frank's Sunday school class for some time. She later described him as \"a fiery persuasive teacher,\" and wrote that Frank Nixon's version of the social gospel inclined her politically toward socialism.\nBy the time of his later adulthood, Nixon openly detailed his political views to strangers, his son Don remembering his father as being willing to debate anyone he encountered in the family market and having an intolerance of Democrats. Nixon voted for Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 United States presidential election, Warren G. Harding in the 1920 presidential election, Herbert Hoover in both the 1928 and 1932 presidential elections, and Franklin Roosevelt in the 1936 election. Aitken described these as erratic voting habits that displayed shifting loyalties in the early life of his son Richard.\nAfter his son Arthur's death in 1925, Nixon frequently pondered and was haunted by the possibility of God allowing the death as a form of punishment directed toward him, his actions afterward being to never against open the family store on Sundays and having the family listen to sermons every evening. Nixon favored Robert P. Shuler, Billy Sunday, and Aimee Semple McPherson, taking his sons once a week to hear either Shuler or McPherson at Trinity Methodist Church.\nIn 1938, Francis' son Richard met Pat Ryan, who Frank developed a \"playful relationship\" with and spared the same lashing outs he had given his sons.\nDuring the controversy surrounding Richard's alleged improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses, Frank was \"reduced to sobs\" in hearing of the story and angered by his son's taking of any funds.\nThe elder Nixons cared for their granddaughters Julie and Tricia while Vice President Nixon focused on activities relating to the 1956 Republican National Convention. Francis experienced a ruptured abdominal artery in the latter part of the month that he was not expected to recover from, resulting in the vice president curtailing his public appearances to tend to his father, who advocated that his son return to San Francisco and focus on the convention; Vice President Nixon declined. On September 3, Nixon was visited by Richard, who he told upon the latter leaving, \"Good night Dick, but I don't think I'll be here in the morning.\" The following day, Francis Nixon died, his funeral being held three days later at the East Whittier Friends Meeting House.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOn June 25, 1908, he married Hannah Milhous. Together, they had five sons:\nHarold Samuel Nixon (June 1, 1909 \u2013 March 7, 1933)\nRichard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 \u2013 April 22, 1994)\nFrancis Donald Nixon (November 23, 1914 \u2013 June 27, 1987)\nArthur Burdg Nixon (May 26, 1918 \u2013 August 19, 1925)\nEdward Calvert Nixon (born May 3, 1930)\nNixon died on September 4, 1956 in La Habra, California, U.S.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nHe was played by Tom Bower in Oliver Stone's Nixon.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNixon Fun Facts via Nixon Foundation",

In 1997, the film was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The footage contained in the newsreel was illegally banned from being shown in Chicago by the Chicago Police Department for fear of causing unrest, and later the Paramount News company agreed to refrain from screening the event elsewhere.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMemorial Day massacre of 1937\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRepublic Steel Strike Riot Newsreel Footage on IMDb",

He was renowned for his uncompromising will and principles\u2014on one occasion, he refused to surrender even after the French had desecrated his ancestral tombs and had arrested and threatened to kill his family.\nBorn into a family of mandarins from H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province, Phan continued his ancestors' traditions by placing first in the metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877. Phan quickly rose through the ranks under Emperor T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption. Phan was appointed as the Imperial Censor, a position that allowed him to criticise his fellow mandarins and even the emperor. As the head of the censorate, Phan's investigations led to the removal of many incompetent or corrupt mandarins.\nUpon T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c's death, Phan almost lost his life during a power struggle in the imperial court. The regent T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thuy\u1ebft disregarded T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c's will of succession, and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year. Phan protested against Thuyet's activities, was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed, before being exiled to his home province. At the time, France had just conquered Vietnam and made it a part of French Indochina. Along with Thuyet, Phan organised rebel armies as part of the C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng movement, which sought to expel the French and install the boy Emperor H\u00e0m Nghi at the head of an independent Vietnam. This campaign continued for three years until 1888, when the French captured H\u00e0m Nghi and exiled him to Algeria.\nPhan and his military assistant Cao Th\u1eafng continued their guerrilla campaign, building a network of spies, bases and small weapons factories. However, Cao Th\u1eafng was killed in the process in late 1893. The decade-long campaign eventually wore Phan down, and he died from dysentery as the French surrounded his forces.\n\n\n== Court official ==\nPhan was born in the village of \u0110\u00f4ng Th\u00e1i in the northern central coast province of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh. \u0110\u00f4ng Th\u00e1i was famous for producing high-ranking mandarins and had been the home of senior imperial officials since the time of the L\u00ea Dynasty. Twelve consecutive generations of the Phan family had been successful mandarinate graduates. All three of Phan's brothers who lived to adulthood passed the imperial examinations and became mandarins. Early on, Phan indicated his distaste for the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year. In his exam response, Phan cited Japan as an example of how an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.\nPhan was never known for his scholarly abilities; it was his reputation for principled integrity that led to his quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c. He was first appointed as a district mandarin in Ninh B\u00ecnh Province, where he punished a Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership had arisen out of the military and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government. Despite this, the Hu\u1ebf court eventually removed Phan from this post.\nPhan was transferred to the Hu\u1ebf court as a member of the censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Thuy\u1ebft, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.\nDespite his prominent position in the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, little is known about Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which was in the process of colonising Vietnam. France had first invaded in 1858, beginning the colonisation of southern Vietnam. Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of Cochinchina. During the period, there was debate in the Hu\u1ebf court on the best strategy to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions. By the time of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with Laos and Cambodia into French Indochina.\nUpon his death in 1883, the childless T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c had named his nephew, Ki\u1ebfn Ph\u00fac, as his successor, rather than D\u1ee5c \u0110\u1ee9c, his most senior heir. T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c had written in his will that D\u1ee5c \u0110\u1ee9c was depraved and unworthy of ruling the country. However, led by Thuyet, the regents enthroned D\u1ee5c \u0110\u1ee9c under the pressure of the ladies of the court. Phan protested against the violation of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c's will of succession and refused to sanction anyone other than Kien Phuc. Lucky to escape the death penalty, Phan was stripped of his positions. Later, D\u1ee5c \u0110\u1ee9c was deposed and executed by Thuyet on the grounds of ignoring court etiquette, ignoring the mourning rites for T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c and having affairs with the late emperor's consorts. Phan again protested the regents' actions and was briefly imprisoned by Thuyet, before being exiled to his home province.\n\n\n== Revolutionary career ==\n\n\n=== C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng ===\nPhan rallied to the cause of the boy Emperor H\u00e0m Nghi\u2014the fourth monarch in little over a year\u2014after an abortive royal uprising at Hu\u1ebf in 1885. Thuyet and fellow regent Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n T\u01b0\u1eddng had enthroned Hi\u1ec7p H\u00f2a after disposing of D\u1ee5c \u0110\u1ee9c. However, the new emperor was wary of the regents' behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence, leading Thuyet to organise his execution. The teenage Ki\u1ebfn Ph\u00fac ascended the throne, but was poisoned by his adoptive mother H\u1ecdc Phi\u2014one of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c's wives\u2014whom he caught having intercourse with Tuong. Kien Phuc was thus replaced by his 14-year-old brother H\u00e0m Nghi. In the meantime, the French concluded that the regents were causing too much trouble and had to be disposed of.\nThuyet had already decided to place H\u00e0m Nghi at the head of the Phong Tr\u00e0o C\u1ea7n Vu\u01a1ng (Loyalty to the Emperor Movement), which sought to end French rule with a royalist rebellion. Phan helped the cause by setting up bases in H\u00e0 T\u0129nh and creating his own guerrilla army. Thuyet had hoped to secure support from the Qing Dynasty of China, but Phan thought that Vietnam's best chance of effective support came from Siam. Gia Long, the founder of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty and great-grandfather of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c, had married his sister off to the King of Siam. He had also used Siam as a base-in-exile during his quest for the throne in the 1780s. However, direct appeals to the Siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition. In preparation for the revolt, Thuyet had been building up an armed base at Tan So for over a year.\nIn any case, the C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng revolt started on July 5, 1885 when Thuyet launched a surprise attack against the colonial forces after a diplomatic confrontation with the French. Thuyet took H\u00e0m Nghi northwards to the Tan So mountain base near the border with Laos after the attack failed. The campaign was launched when the emperor issued the Can Vuong edict that had been prepared by the regent.\nPhan initially rallied support from his native village and set up his headquarters on Mount V\u0169 Quang, which overlooked the coastal French fortress at H\u00e0 T\u0129nh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts. His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms. Phan initially used the local scholar-gentry as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution was heavy. Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who had been removed from office as a result of Phan's critical report. The disgraced official was now a French collaborator, serving as the governor of Ngh\u1ec7 An Province.\nThe strategy of attempting to pressure Phan into capitulating was a classical strategy of coercion. The French used an old friend and fellow villager to make an emotional and deeply Confucian appeal for Phan to surrender in order to save his brother, his ancestral tombs and his entire village. Phan was reported to have replied:\n\nFrom the time I joined with you in the Can Vuong movement, I determined to forget the question of family and village. Now I have but one tomb, a very large one, that must be defended: the land of Vietnam. I have only one brother, very important, that is in danger: more than twenty million countrymen. If I worry about my own tombs, who will worry about defending the tombs of the rest of the country? If I save my own brother, who will save all the other brothers of the country? There is only one way for me to die now.\n\nPhan was later reported to have simply retorted, \"If anyone carves up my brother, remember to send me some of the soup\". However, he held no illusions about the prospect of successfully driving out the French, stating \"It is our destiny. We accept it.\"\nThis incident and Phan's response are often cited as one of the reasons why he was so admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism. He identified with a countrywide cause, far removed from the questions of family and region.\nPhan's men were well-trained and disciplined, and the military inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from Cao Thang, a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by Phan's brother a decade earlier. They operated in the provinces of Thanh H\u00f3a in the north, H\u00e0 T\u0129nh, Ngh\u1ec7 An in the centre and Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh in the south, with their strongest areas being the two central provinces. In 1887, Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided, ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics. His men built up a network of base camps, food caches, intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts. Phan traveled to the north in the hope of coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders. In the meantime, Cao Thang led a force of around 1,000 men with some 500 firearms between them. Cao Thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874-model French weapons that had been captured. For the purpose of creating such replica guns, they captured Vietnamese artisans. According to French officers who later captured some of the Vietnamese copies, the weapons were proficiently reproduced. The only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in the tempering of the springs, which were improvised with umbrella spokes, and the lack of rifling in the barrels, which curtailed range and accuracy.\nNevertheless, the weaponry used by Phan's rebels was far inferior to that of their adversaries, and their inland positions were within firing range of the French Navy. The Vietnamese could not rely on China to give them material support, and other European powers such as Portugal, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were unwilling to sell them weapons for various reasons. Thus, Phan had to explore overland routes to procure weapons from Siamese sources\u2014using seafaring transport was impossible due to the presence of the French Navy. He instructed his followers to create a secret route from H\u00e0 T\u0129nh through Laos into northeastern Siam; one such route from Mount Vu Quang was believed to have been created around 1888. It is unclear if Phan himself went to Thailand, but a young female supporter named Co Tam was his designated arms buyer in Tha Uthen, which boasted a substantial expatriate Vietnamese community. In 1890, the Siamese Army transported around 1,000 Austrian repeating-rifles from Bangkok to Luang Prabang in Laos. However, it is unclear whether the weapons found their way into Vietnamese hands or whether they were related to Co Tam's activities.\n\n\n=== After C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng ===\nIn 1888, H\u00e0m Nghi's Muong bodyguard Truong Quang Ngoc betrayed him, leading to the emperor's capture and deportation to Algeria. Phan and Cao Thang fought on in the mountainous areas of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh, Ngh\u1ec7 An and Thanh H\u00f3a. Another 15 bases were built along the mountain to complement the headquarters at Vu Quang. Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice. Local bases were supported by nearby villages and excess funds were sent to Vu Quang. Phan's men foraged and sold cinnamon bark to raise funds, while lowland peasants donated spare metals for the production of weapons.\nWhen Phan returned from the north in 1889, his first order was to track down H\u00e0m Nghi's betrayer Ngoc. When he was found, Phan personally executed Ngoc in Tuy\u00ean H\u00f3a. He then began a series of small-unit attacks on French installations through the summer of 1890, but these proved indecisive. The French relied mostly on district and provincial colonial units to man their perpetually increasing line of forts, which were usually commanded by a French lieutenant. In late 1890, a French effort to move into the low-lying villages and isolate the populace from the mountainous rebel bases failed. In the spring of 1892, a major French sweep of H\u00e0 T\u0129nh failed, and in August, Cao Thang seized the initiative with a bold counterattack on the provincial capital. The rebels broke into the prison and freed their compatriots, killing a large number of the Vietnamese soldiers who defended the penitentiary as members of the French colonial forces. This caused the French to intensify their efforts against Phan, and a counteroffensive was conducted throughout the remainder of 1892, forcing the rebels to retreat back into the mountains. Two of their bases fell and steady French pressure began to break their covert resistance links with lowland villages. This compounded the problems of securing food, supplies, intelligence data and recruits. A ring of French forts continued to be erected, increasingly pinning down Phan's men. The only notable gain for Phan's forces during this period was the acquisition of gunpowder supplies from Siam. This enabled them to mix foreign and local powder in a 50:50 ratio, rather than their previous weaker mixture of 20:80.\nLate in the year, the burden on Phan increased after the loss of two Can Vuong allies. In September, Tong Duy T\u00e2n\u2014who led the royalists in Thanh H\u00f3a\u2014 was captured and publicly executed. Nguyen Thien Thuat, who had been active in the northern provinces of H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean and H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng, fled to Guangxi in China. The supporters of Tan and Tuat moved south and integrated into Phan's force.\nIn mid-1893, Cao Thang proposed a full-scale attack on the provincial seat of Ngh\u1ec7 An and the surrounding posts. The plan proposed to Phan included diversions to the south and the training of almost 2,000 men in conventional military tactics. Unconvinced of its viability, Phan reluctantly approved the plan. The troops were eager, but after overpowering several small posts en route, the main force was pinned down while attacking the French fort of No on September 9, 1893. Along with his brother, Cao Thang was mortally wounded while leading a risky frontal attack with 150 men, and the forces retreated in disarray. Phan regarded the loss of Cao Thang as a significant one, admitting as much in delivering the eulogy and funeral oration. According to the historian David Marr, there was evidence that Phan clearly realised the advantages and limitations of prolonged resistance. Although Phan had previously stated that he was not expecting ultimate success, the guerrilla leader thought that it was important to keep pressuring the French in order to demonstrate to the populace that there was an alternative to what he felt was a defeatist attitude from the Hu\u1ebf court.\n\n\n=== Downfall ===\n\nHo\u00e0ng Cao Kh\u1ea3i, the French-installed viceroy of Tonkin, perceived Phan's intent to a degree that his French masters did not. Khai was from a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan. He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic. By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure. In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs of his ancestors, publicly displaying the remains in H\u00e0 T\u0129nh.\nKhai delivered a message to Phan via a relative. Phan sent a written reply, allowing their exchange to be studied. Khai recalled the common origins of the pair and promised Phan that he would lobby Governor-General Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan and other French officials for an amnesty in return for Phan's surrender. Khai credited Phan with righteousness, loyalty and dedication towards the monarchy.\n\nThe situation has changed and even those without intelligence or education have concluded that nothing remains to be saved. How is it that you, a man of vast understanding, do not realise this?... You are determined to do whatever you deem to be righteous... All that matters indeed is giving of one's life to one's country. No one therefore can deter you from your goal.\nI have always been taught that superior men should consider the care of the people as fundamental; who has ever heard of men who were loyal to their King but forgot the people's aspirations?... As of now, hundreds of families are subject to grief; how do you have the heart to fight on? I venture to predict that, should you pursue your struggle, not only will the population of our village be destroyed but our entire country will be transformed into a sea of blood and a mountain of bones.\n\nAccording to Marr, \"Phan Dinh Phung's reply was a classic in savage understatement, utilizing standard formalism in the interest of propaganda, with deft denigration of his opponent\". Phan appealed to Vietnamese nationalist sentiment, recalling his country's stubborn resistance to Chinese aggression. He cited defensive wars against the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan and Ming dynasties, asking why a country \"a thousand times more powerful\" could not annex Vietnam. Phan concluded that it was \"because the destiny of our country has been willed by Heaven itself\".\nPhan placed the responsibility for the suffering of the people at the feet of the French, who \"acted like a storm\". After analysing his own actions, Phan concluded with a thinly veiled attack on Khai and his collaborators.\n\nIf our region has suffered to such an extent, it was not only from the misfortunes of war. You must realise that wherever the French go, there flock around them groups of petty men who offer plans and tricks to gain the enemy's confidence. These persons create every kind of enmity; they incriminate innocent persons, blaming one one day, punishing another the next. They use every expedient to squeeze the people out of their possessions. That is how hundred of misdeeds, thousands of offenses have been perpetrated.\n\nKhai's appeal was rebutted with an appeal to history, nationalist sentiment and a demand that the blame for death and destruction lay with the colonial forces and their Vietnamese assistants. Phan raised the stakes above family and village to the entire nation and its populace.\nWith Phan's rebuke in his hands, Khai translated both documents into French and presented them to de Lanessan, proposing that it was time for the final \"destruction of this scholar gentry rebellion\". In July 1895, French area commanders called in 3,000 troops to tighten the cordon around the three remaining rebel bases. The insurgents were able to execute ambushes at night, but Phan contracted dysentery and had to be carried on a stretcher whenever his unit moved. A collaborator mandarin named Nguyen Than, who had previous experience in pacification in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i and Qu\u1ea3ng Nam, was drafted in to isolate the insurgents from their supporters in the villages. Cut off from their supplies, the insurgents were left to survive by eating roots and occasional handfuls of dried corn. Their shoes were worn through and most were without blankets. Phan died of dysentery on January 21, 1896, and his captured followers were executed. A report submitted by the de Lanessan to the Minister of Colonies in Paris stated that \"the soul of resistance to the protectorate was gone\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nPhan's remains were disturbed after his death. Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Kh\u1ea3, a Catholic mandarin and father of Ngo Dinh Diem\u2014the first President of South Vietnam\u2014was a member of the French colonial administration. Kha had Phan's tomb exhumed and used the remains in gunpowder used for executing revolutionaries.\nPhan is widely regarded by Vietnamese people as a revolutionary hero. Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, regarded as the leading Vietnamese anti-colonial figure of the early 20th century, strongly praised Phan in his writing, with particular emphasis on his defiance of Khai. During Phan Boi Chau's career as a teacher, he strongly emphasised Phan's deeds to his students. In 1941, after returning to Vietnam after decades in exile, the Marxist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, then using the name Nguyen Ai Quoc (Nguyen the Patriot), invoked the memory of Phan in appealing to the public for support for his independence movement. Like Phan, Ho was a native of Ngh\u1ec7 An and H\u00e0 T\u0129nh. In the 1940s, Ho's Vietminh named their self-produced style of grenades in honour of Phan. Since then, Ho's communists have portrayed themselves as the modern day incarnations of revered nationalist leaders such as Phan, Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng \u0110\u1ecbnh and Emperors L\u00ea L\u1ee3i and Quang Trung, who expelled Chinese forces from Vietnam. Both North and South Vietnam had prominent thoroughfares in their capital cities (Hanoi and Saigon, respectively) named in Phan's honour.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nChapuis, Oscar (2000).

            "content": "Sports Entertainment Xtreme (S.E.X.) was a heel professional wrestling stable in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, initially led by Vince Russo. It debuted in December 2002, but disbanded in mid-2003.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe angle began with a masked man known only as \"Mr. Wrestling III\" interfering in matches. On November 20, 2002 during a weekly TNA pay-per-view, Jeff Jarrett defeated Ron Killings to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship with help from Mr. Wrestling III, who was then unmasked and turned out to be Vince Russo. The following week, Russo gave Jarrett the choice to be with him or against him, which Jarrett declined, much to Russo's dismay. This led to numerous attacks on Jeff Jarrett. On December 4, 2002 Russo officially formed a faction called S.E.X. (Sports Entertainment Xtreme) with Don and Ron Harris and B.G. James. This led to a takeover style storyline, where wrestlers would turn their backs on TNA and instead join S.E.X., similar to the New World Order storyline in WCW. The group mainly feuded with Jeff Jarrett, Ron Killings, Curt Hennig, America's Most Wanted, Dusty Rhodes, The Warriors, Jorge Estrada, The Disciples of the New Church, and A.J. Styles after he refused to join S.E.X. On March 4, 2003 after months of feuding, Jarrett hit Russo on an emotional level when he showed a video with Russo's children pleading with him to stop what he was doing which led him to go into a fit and going as far as threatening to beat his children. The next day, Vince Russo \"retired\" in order to become a better father which started the decline of S.E.X. On March 19, 2003 Sports Entertainment Xtreme descended into disarray. With Vince Russo gone, Glenn Gilbertti tried to take control of the group. As soon as this happened, Sonny Siaki also tried to become the leader. On June 18, 2003, Russo said he \"owned\" the S.E.X. name, leaving them without a gimmick. After a while the S.E.X. faded from existence and its former members went their separate ways, most remaining in TNA at the time.\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe main goal of S.E.X. was to take control of the rest of TNA. It was one of the first total promotion storylines in TNA Wrestling history. It led to the creation of the kayfabe position of \"Director of Authority\", who would be the on-screen face of the \"TNA Championship Committee\". The most notable effects of S.E.X. was the formation of the trio known as Triple X, featuring Elix Skipper, Low Ki/Senshi, and Christopher Daniels, and the completion of the initial main event rise of A.J. Styles.\n\n\n== Members ==\nWrestlers\n\nVince Russo (leader)\nGlenn Gilbertti\nDesire\nDisgraceland\nDavid Flair\nB.G.

            "content": "Epoxy is either any of the basic components or the cured end products of epoxy resins, as well as a colloquial name for the epoxide functional group. Epoxy resins, also known as polyepoxides, are a class of reactive prepolymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups. Epoxy resins may be reacted (cross-linked) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or with a wide range of co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and acid anhydrides), phenols, alcohols and thiols. These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing. Reaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a thermosetting polymer, often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, fiber-reinforced plastic materials and structural adhesives.\n\n\n== Epoxy resin ==\n\nEpoxy resins are low molecular weight pre-polymers or higher molecular weight polymers which normally contain at least two epoxide groups. The epoxide group is also sometimes referred to as a glycidyl or oxirane group.\nA wide range of epoxy resins are produced industrially. The raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely petroleum derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make epichlorohydrin).\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials, and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which require melting to enable processing.\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide content. This is commonly expressed as the epoxy equivalent weight, which is the number of epoxide equivalents in 1 kg of resin (Eq./kg), or as the equivalent weight, which is the weight in grammes of resin containing 1 mole equivalent of epoxide (g/mol). One measure may be simply converted to another:\nEquivalent weight (g/mol) = 1000 / epoxide number (Eq./kg)\nThe equivalent weight or epoxide number is used to calculate the amount of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with stoichiometric or near-stoichiometric quantities of curative to achieve maximum physical properties.\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as formulating.\n\n\n=== Bisphenol A epoxy resin ===\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining epichlorohydrin and bisphenol A to give bisphenol A diglycidyl ethers.\n\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a thermoplastic. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and isocyanates.\n\n\n=== Bisphenol F epoxy resin ===\nBisphenol F may also undergo epoxidation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. Compared to DGEBA, bisphenol F epoxy resins have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gramme, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\n\n=== Novolac epoxy resin ===\nReaction of phenols with formaldehyde and subsequent glycidylation with epichlorohydrin produces epoxidised novolacs, such as epoxy phenol novolacs (EPN) and epoxy cresol novolacs (ECN). These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n\n=== Aliphatic epoxy resin ===\nAliphatic epoxy resins are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting resins may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as reactive diluents. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents. A related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays low viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required.\n\n\n=== Glycidylamine epoxy resin ===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-p-aminophenol (functionality 3) and N,N',N'',N'''-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methan (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n\n== Curing epoxy resins ==\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process. Curing of epoxy resins is an exothermic reaction and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a copolymer with polyfunctional curatives or hardeners. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\nWhilst some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to 150 \u00b0C being common, and up to 200 \u00b0C for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as latent hardeners. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of accelerators. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n\n=== Homopolymerisation ===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature to effect curing, so finds only niche applications industrially. Epoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for UV coatings).\n\n\n=== Amines ===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an addition reaction with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network. Aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Reactivity is broadly in the order aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Whilst aromatic amines were once widely used as epoxy resin hardeners due to the excellent end properties they imparted, health concerns with handling these materials means that they have now largely been replaced by safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alternatives.\n\n\n=== Anhydrides ===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines. The low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n\n=== Phenols ===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures (130-180 \u00b0C), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for powder coatings.\n\n\n=== Thiols ===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. Whilst the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical rock bolt anchors. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n\n== History ==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934. Claims of discovery of bisphenol-A-based epoxy resins include Pierre Castan in 1943. Castan's work was licensed by Ciba, Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off and later sold in the late 1990s and is now the Advanced Materials business unit of Huntsman Corporation of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe & Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin. Devoe & Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to Shell Chemical; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of Hexion Inc..\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, adhesives and composite materials such as those using carbon fiber and fiberglass reinforcements (although polyester, vinyl ester, and other thermosetting resins are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good electrical insulating properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example silver-filled epoxies with good electrical conductivity are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.\n\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured powder coatings. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. Some epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents. Epoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.\nPolyester epoxies are used as powder coatings for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing rebar. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as primers to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where corrosion (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are acidic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as terrazzo flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring. Epoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. One of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n\n=== Adhesives ===\n\nEpoxy adhesives are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes polyurethane, acrylic, cyanoacrylate, and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, transparent or opaque/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).\nSome epoxies are cured by exposure to ultraviolet light. Such epoxies are commonly used in optics, fiber optics, and optoelectronics.\n\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce molds, master models, laminates, castings, fixtures, and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and vinyl ester resins, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant thermoset polymer matrix composite parts.\n\n\n=== Electrical systems and electronics ===\n\nEpoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, and insulators. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding integrated circuits, transistors and hybrid circuits, and making printed circuit boards. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"FR-4 board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.\nFlexible epoxy resins are used for potting transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of resin dispensing.\n\n\n=== Petroleum & petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named \"water shut-off treatment\".\n\n\n=== Consumer and marine applications ===\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to UV light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common polyester resins, epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\nNormal gelcoat formulated for use with polyester resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used. The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide (MEKP), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) By proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) Ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n\n=== Aerospace applications ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include glass, carbon, Kevlar, and boron. Epoxies are also used as a structural glue. Materials like wood, and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. \n\n\n=== Biology ===\nWater-soluble epoxies such as Durcupan   are commonly used for embedding electron microscope samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a microtome and then imaged. \n\n\n=== Art ===\nEpoxy resin, mixed with pigment, may be used as a painting medium, by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture.\n\n\n== Industry ==\nAs of 2006, the epoxy industry amounts to more than US$5 billion in North America and about US$15 billion worldwide. The Chinese market has been growing rapidly, and accounts for more than 30% of the total worldwide market. It is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners.\nThese commodity epoxy manufacturers mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these raw materials. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding mineral fillers (talc, silica, alumina, etc.), by adding flexibilizers, viscosity reducers, colorants, thickeners, accelerators, adhesion promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\nImpacted by the global economic slump, the epoxy market size declined to $15.8 billion in 2009, almost to the level of 2005. In some regional markets it even decreased nearly 20%. The current epoxy market is experiencing positive growth as the global economy revives. With an annual growth rate of 3.5 - 4% the epoxy market is expected to reach $17.7 billion by 2012 and $21.35 billion by 2015. Higher growth rate is foreseen thereafter due to stronger demands from epoxy composite market and epoxy adhesive market.\n\n\n== Health risks ==\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally corrosive, but may also be classed as toxic or carcinogenic/mutagenic. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as irritant to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents. Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an allergic reaction. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of dermatitis, particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of occupational asthma among users of plastics. Bisphenol A, which is used to manufacture a common class of epoxy resins, is a known endocrine disruptor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThermosetting polymer\nThermoset polymer matrix\nPlastic\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEpoxy Resin health hazards (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ Wayback Machine https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm\nThe chemistry of epoxide, simple to understand",

                "Chudasama dynasty"
            ], 
            "content": "The early history of Chudasama dynasty of Saurashtra (now in Gujarat, India) is almost lost. The bardic legends differs very much in names, order and numbers so they are not considered reliable. Mandalika Kavya, a Sanskrit poem by Gangadhara, gives some information on dynasty but it has little historical value. Some of their inscriptions gives their early genealogy but they too differ in order of succession. Ranchhodji Diwan, A. K. Forbes, James Burgess and Gaurishankar Oza had tried to fix genealogy and chronology. Based on the dates of the inscriptions assigned to Chudasama kings and other literary sources, the genealogy and chronology of latter half of the dynasty can be established fairly. Still it is certain that they ruled about from about Vikram Samvat (VS) 900 to VS 1527 (c. 875 CE to 1472 CE).\n\n\n== Chronology and Genealogy ==\n\n\n=== Based on Inscriptions ===\nThere is no inscription of the period before the king Mandalika I available. Still it is certain that they had established their rule in the Saurashtra region before the Chaulukya king Mularaja came to power in Anahilavada because literary sources tell about battles between Chudasama kings and Chaulukya kings; Mularaja and Jayasimha Siddharaja. Dhandusar inscription (VS 1445) says that the founder of the dynasty was Chudachandra. A Vanthali inscription tells about Mandalika, a kings whose kingdom was captured by Jagatsimha, a feudatory of Chaulukya king Viradhavala. This Mandalika king must be another Mandalika king mentioned in latter half genealogy. As Viradhavala is known to live in VS 1288, he must be assigned the same date. As Vanthali inscription date VS 1346, it must have been under the Jagatsimha's family till then. It seems that a later Chudasama king Mandalika regained Vanthali when Chaulukya rule weakened. So the later genealogy starts from him in later inscriptions. The Chudasamas continued to rule till VS 1527 (1472 CE) when they were defeated by Gujarat Sultan Mahmud Begada. As inscriptions says about their resistance to Gujarat Sultans, it can be said that they were the most powerful dynasty in Saurashtra region at that time.\n\n\n=== Early attempts ===\n\n\n==== Ranchhodji Amarji (1825) ====\nRanchhodji Amarji, Diwan or prime minister of Junagadh State wrote Tarikh-i-Sorath in Persian in 1825. Ranchhodji wrote that Chudasamas belonged to Chandravanshi Rajput and they are descendants of Shri Sadashiv and said to have come from Sindh. He wrote that the regular succession of nine men named Navghan, ten named Jakhra, eleven named Alansingh and other individuals of with various names have ruled.\nHe had written following chronology in Tarikh-i-Sorath:\nAfter defeat by Mahmud Begada, the sons of Mandalika was given Jagir of Junagadh and made Jagirdar but the powers were exercised by Thanadar appointed by Ahmedabad kings and later by governors.\n\n\n==== James Burgess (1876-1882) ====\nJames Burgess translated T\u00e2rikh-i-Sora\u1e6dh in English as T\u00e2rikh-i-Sora\u1e6dh, a history of the provinces of Sora\u1e6dh and H\u00e2l\u00e2r in K\u00e2thi\u00e2w\u00e2d from Gujarati translations of Persian manuscripts. The translation was edited by James W. Watson and published finally in 1882. He had consulted several manuscripts and taken support of an inscription in Vastupal Jain Temple on Mount Girnar to fix the chronology given by Ranchhodji Amarji which he had published in Report on the Antiquities of Kathiawad and Kachh and subsequently in the translation as an editor note. He had added information of other sources and had done conjectural corrections in the dates as seem required. These corrections are applied only to the dates when converted into CE and where doubtful marked with a (?).\nRanchhodji had listed the reigns of the first four kings beginning with Navaghana I extend over 151 years and then a blank occurs of 22 years between Navaghana II and his successor Mandalika I. Burgess had included Khengar II (1107? CE) omitted by Ranchhodji. Burgess notes that Ranchhodji had omitted Navghana (1235?) after Mandalika whome he had assigned 22 years and 3.75 years, beginning in VS 1270 and the next ruler Mahipala's reign begin in VS 1302 thus 10 years were unaccounted for, or about the same time Navaghana IV reigned. He also noted that Ranchhodji gave three successors of Mugatsingh in order; Madhupat (VS 1416-1421) , Mandalika (VS 1421-1439), Malek (VS 1439-1450) which is probably derived from an inscription in Revatikunda which gives following genealogy: Mandalika lll; his son Mahipala; his son Khangara lV; his son Jayasimha; his son Mugatsimha; his sons Mandalika and Melak; and Jayasimha, son of Melak .Tho chronology in the text is confirmed by the Mandalika Kavya. Burgess had allowed the dates VS 1421 and 1439 to stand but proposed alteration to 1428 and 1433.\nBurgess has noted that some copies give the date VS 874 of Navghan\u2019s accession, and allow 42 years for his reign. He disapproves of James Tod's counting Chudachandra as the fortieth prince before his own time, and the eighth before Jam Unad, whom Tod had placed in VS 1110, assuming that Chudachand must have lived about VS 960.\nAfter their subjugation to the Ahmedabad kings, the dynasty seems to have been preserved as tributary Jagirdars for another century; the list of these princes stands thus:\nNotes\nSome copies give following chronology:\nThus James Burgess has suggested possibility of alternate chronology:\n\n\n==== James W. Watson (1884) and Harold Wilberforce-Bell (1916) ====\nJames W. Watson, in Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Kathiawar Volume VIII (1884), had given the chronology of Chudasama kings. The early kings in chronology were based on the bardic legends and latter chronology was based on the inscriptions.\nHarold Wilberforce-Bell wrote The History of Kathiawad from the Earliest Times in 1916. He expanded on the chronology of Watson. In corroboration to inscriptions, the kings starting Mandalik I were correct in chronology but dates of accession varies from later chronologies. He presented following chronology:\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Franz Wickhoff (7 May 1853 \u2013 6 April 1909) was an Austrian art historian, and is considered a member of the Vienna School of Art History.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFranz Wickhoff was born on 7 May 1853 in Steyr. He studied at the University of Vienna under Alexander Conze and Moritz Thausing.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1879 he received a position at the k.k. \u00d6sterreichisches Museum f\u00fcr Kunst und Industrie (today the Museum f\u00fcr angewandte Kunst) in Vienna, where he met Giovanni Morelli and became interested in his theories of connoisseurship. In 1882 Wickhoff began to teach at the University of Vienna.\nIn 1895 Wickhoff published his major work, Die Wiener Genesis, a study of the development of Roman art from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine I. The book was significant for its appreciation of both \"high imperial\" Roman art, and indeed also late antique art, both of which had previously, under the overwhelming influence of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, been considered as stages of progressive decline following the achievements of Greek art. Wickhoff's study would prove to be of great importance for the later Sp\u00e4tr\u00f6mische Kunstindustrie of Alois Riegl, his younger contemporary at the Museum, which continued the project of rehabilitating late antique art. It also sparked the extended feud between Riegl and Wickhoff, on the one side, and Josef Strzygowski, on the other, concerning the origins of the late antique style.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nWickhoff died in Vienna on 6 April 1909. His students included many of the major figures of the next generation of Viennese art history, including Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Walter Friedl\u00e4nder, Wilhelm Koehler, Erica Tietze-Conrat, Hans Tietze and Gustav Gl\u00fcck. He is buried on Isola di San Michele in Venice.\n\n\n== References ==",

In 2014, the company, located in Altdorf near Nuremberg, Germany had approximately 208 million EUR in sales with 1,720 employees.\n\n\n== Company history ==\n1951 SUSPA Suspension Technology GmbH was inaugurated and manufactured spring struts for two-wheel vehicles. 1959 SUSPA develops a damping system for washing machines which ends the irritating \"bouncing\". Just three years later SUSPA is the market leader. The first products for the automobile industry are gas springs for opening and closing of tailgates in 1964. 1969 SUSPA develops a height adjustment system and a positioning system for backrests of office chairs.1973\u20131978 SUSPA expands in Europe, Asia and America; SUSPA develops silicone-damped impact absorbers for automobiles. 1988 SUSPA diversifies to a three-component water paint system and thus protects the environment by abstaining from using solvents and amines. 1991 SUSPA develops height adjustment systems for tables and work surfaces. 1994 a new business is founded in India. The mass production of spoiler adjustment systems begins in 1999 and SUSPA becomes a system supplier for the automotive industry. One year later SUSPA produces its first crash management system and opens an assembly plant in the Czech Republic. In 2003 the production capacities in Asia are expanded. Steadily increasing price competition in the world market coupled with heavily increased material costs forces SUSPA in 2008 to stop manufacturing gas springs for chairs and to focus more on the core business (Automotive and Industry). In June 2009 the company Tyrol Equity from Austria purchases 80 per cent of the company shares. In June 2012 the Tyrolean Industry Holding sells their SUSPA shares to the private investor group Andlinger & Company GmbH.\n\n\n== Company Structure ==\nThe company is divided into two divisions, with the business segments Mechanical Applications, Crash Management, Household Applications and Powered Applications.\nSUSPA has the following subsidiary companies:\nSUSPA GmbH, plants in Altdorf near Nuremberg (Germany) and Sulzbach-Rosenberg (Germany)\nSUSPA Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH, Kleve (Germany)\nSUSPA CZ, Bor (Czech Republic)\nSUSPA Incorporated, Grand Rapids (Michigan, United States)\nSUSPA Pneumatics (India) Pvt. Ltd., Chennai (India)\nSUSPA (Nanjing) Co. Ltd., Nanjing (Peoples Republic of China)\n\n\n== Products ==\nThe most important product is the gas spring offered in many different varieties, but during the last few years SUSPA has expanded its capabilities to become a system supplier, especially for the automotive industry, for which they develop and produce complete adjustment- or crash management systems. SUSPA adds value to the gas spring by adding more features; hence, e.g. table columns which can easily be operated and only consist of one single gas spring (Product: VARISTAND).\n\n\n=== Gas Springs ===\nNon-Locking Gas springs for automotive and industrial applications\nLockable Gas springs\n\n\n=== Dampers ===\nHydraulic Dampers\nFriction Dampers\n\n\n=== Adjustment Systems ===\nAutomotive Powered Spoilers\nSeat Comfort Drives\nPowered Tailgates and Trunklids\nConvertible Roof Power Closures\nOffice Desk Height Adjustment Systems\n\n\n=== Crash Management ===\nCrash Management Systems\nOccupants Protection Systems\nPedestrian Protection Systems\n\n\n=== Piston Rods and Tubes ===\nSpindles\nBolts\nPins\nPiston Rods\nTubes\n\n\n== Executive Board ==\nTimo Stahl (since 2005), Thomas Peuker (since 2011), Hans J\u00f6rg Kaltenbrunner (since 2012)\n\n\n== External links ==\nWebsite of Suspa GmbH",

It is usually up to 2 metres high and produces white flowers in spring and autumn.\nThe species was first formally described in 1824 by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who gave it the name Eriostemon myoporoides. It was transferred to the genus Philotheca in 1998.\nFive subspecies are currently recognised in the Australian Plant Census:\nP. myoporoides subsp. acuta\nP. myoporoides subsp. brevipedunculata\nP. myoporoides subsp. euroensis \u2014 occurs in the Garden Range near Euroa, Victoria\nP. myoporoides subsp. myoporoides\nP. myoporoides subsp. petraeus \u2014 occurs on Mount Stewart in East Gippsland, Victoria\nIn recent years a number of subspecies have been raised to species status including Philotheca conduplicata, P. epilosa, P. glasshousiensis (syn. P. myoporoides subsp. leichhardti), P. obovatifolia and P. queenslandica.\nPhilotheca myoporoides occurs in dry forest and heathland in New South Wales. In Victoria, it is recorded in woodland in rocky, mountainous areas in association with Eucalyptus regnans. It is also found in Queensland.\nCaterpillars of the Orchard Butterfly feed on this species.\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe species is well adapted to cultivation, and plants are commercially available at nurseries in Australia. The species prefers a well-drained position in light shade. Established plants tolerate both dry periods and moderate frost. Plants may be propagated from semi-mature cuttings, though some forms are slow to take root.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Philotheca myoporoides (DC.) Bayly\".

            "content": "The United States Navy at one time had nuclear powered cruisers as part of its fleet. The first such ship was USS Long Beach (CGN-9). Commissioned in late summer 1961, she was the world's first nuclear powered surface combatant. She was followed a year later by USS Bainbridge (DLGN-25). While Long Beach was a 'true cruiser', meaning she was designed and built as a cruiser, Bainbridge began life as a frigate, though at that time the Navy was using the hull code \"DLGN\" for \"destroyer leader, guided missile, nuclear\". This was prior to the enactment of the 1975 ship reclassification plan, in which frigates (DLG/DLGN), (which were essentially large destroyers), were reclassified as cruisers, so that the US Navy's numbers would compete with those of the Soviet Navy. Long Beach, the largest of all the nuclear cruisers, was equipped with a C1W cruiser reactor, while all the others were equipped with D2G destroyer reactors.\nIn the summer of 1964, Long Beach and Bainbridge would meet up with USS Enterprise (CVAN-65), the Navy's first nuclear powered aircraft carrier, to form Task Force One, an all-nuclear powered naval unit. They would commence Operation Sea Orbit, in which they circumnavigated the globe, without refuelling. It was a remarkable achievement for its time, a naval group capable of sailing over 48,000 kilometers (26,000 nmi; 30,000 mi) in just 65 days, without replenishment.\nIn the spring of 1967 came the Navy's third nuclear powered cruiser, (though initially labeled a frigate), USS Truxtun (DLGN-35), a heavily modified design based on the Belknap-class cruiser. Truxtun would be followed by the 2-ship California class, beginning with USS California (CGN-36) in February 1974 and USS South Carolina (CGN-37) in January 1975. The US Navy was the only fleet in the world with nuclear powered cruisers, until 1974 when the USSR would begin construction on their own nuclear battlecruiser, the Kirov class. The Soviets would build 4 in total, between 1974 and 1998.\nThe last nuclear powered cruisers the Americans would produce would be the 4-ship Virginia class. USS Virginia (CGN-38) was commissioned in 1976, followed by USS Texas (CGN-39) in 1977, USS Mississippi (CGN-40) in 1978 and finally USS Arkansas (CGN-41) in 1980. Ultimately, all these ships would prove to be too costly to maintain and they would all be retired between 1993 and 1999.

            "content": "Sammy Chand is a record producer, soundtrack composer, artist, and entrepreneur. He is also the founder of Rukus Avenue, a South Asian record label based in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSammy has transformed both the musical landscape and the South Asian community with a storied career spanning over two decades. In 1996, he laid the foundation for Rukus Avenue, as an independent record label and platform for an emerging scene of South Asian musicians in North America. This seminal company was at the forefront of a community-driven movement to establish a new identity for South-Asian Americans, that were charged with the task of reconciling traditional cultural values with American ones. Chand had made a name for himself in the world of film and television through a lengthy list of placements. Under his leadership, the label gained an international presence, beginning with a landmark distribution deal with Sony Music in India and a more recent global agreement with The Orchard.\nEarly releases such as Passage to India (Various, 2001) and The Movement (Karmacy, 2005), helped to cement Chand\u2019s status as dynamic music producer and cultural ambassador. His solo debut, Tale of a Crown (2010) further demonstrates his ability to pair original musical elements found in South Asian music with a variety of other genres - a Chand signature.\nThroughout his career, Chand and his music have built a formidable bond with the film and television community. His notable placements include CBS News, PBS, The Oprah Winfrey Show, America\u2019s Most Wanted, Leela, So You Think You Can Dance?, Anthony Bourdain\u2019s No Reservations and the Weather Channel\u2019s Storm Riders. In 2008, he partnered with the Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles to bring a live musical component to the festival that would properly articulate the intimate relationship between music and film in Indian Cinema. The IFFLA Rhythm Village and IFFLA Rhythm Village Unplugged under his direction, have become highly popular additions to the annual festival.\nToday, Chand is further advancing this movement and his sound with the third generation of Rukus Avenue artists. He is currently producing the debut from Elephants With Guns, an eclectic band that, \u201ccollects music, sounds and noises from different parts of the world, wraps them in twine, and presents them to you.\u201d He is also currently writing and recording material for Blood and Treasure, the follow-up to Tale of a Crown. Chand currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Solo Albums ===\nPassage to India (2001)\nTale of a Crown (2010)\n\n\n=== Collaborations ===\nKarmacy - The Movement (2005)\nRasika - Sari (W)rap (2010)\n\n\n=== Music Placements ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRukus Avenue\niTunes\nIMDb\nFacebook",

Ward, Supertramp, Pilot (Pilot), Diana Ross, Carly Simon, Art Garfunkel, Leo Sayer, Paul McCartney (Thrillington), Mary Hopkin (\"Those Were The Days\"), Al Stewart, Chris de Burgh, Fleetwood Mac and Chris Rea. He also arranged strings on several Cliff Richard albums, I'm Nearly Famous (1976), Every Face Tells a Story (1977) and Green Light (1978). Hewson also worked with the British band Jigsaw, including arrangements for their hit single, \"Sky High\".\nApart from his own RAH Band project, he was a producer in the 1980s for Toyah Willcox, Five Star, and Shakin' Stevens. He was and co-producer and conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra on Cliff Richard's 1983 live album Dressed for the Occasion (which included the UK hit single \"True Love Ways\"). In recent years, he has written music for television shows and advertising spots. His song \"Pearly\" was recorded by The Pearls.\n\n\n== The RAH Band ==\nHewson founded The RAH Band \u2013 of which he was the sole member and which took its name from his initials \u2013 in 1977 \u2013 to release an instrumental called \"The Crunch\". The piece climbed to number 6 in the UK Singles Chart. Hewson played all the musical instruments himself. The arrangement involved the use of no synthesisers, only conventional guitar and keyboards with pedal effects. He was later featured on Top of the Pops. A number of jazz funk releases followed. The second big hit single for the RAH Band was in 1985, when the soul ballad \"Clouds Across the Moon\", also reached number 6 in the UK chart. Vocals were provided by his wife Liz, also known as \"Dizzy Lizzy\".\nIn July 2007, Hewson released a remixed \"Clouds Across the Moon '07\", which featured vocalist Emma Charles.\nThe RAH band's releases were issued under a variety of record labels, including Good Earth Records, DJM, KR Records, TMT Records and RCA.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Love For Hire\" (1976) (as Richard Hewson Orchestra)\n\"The Crunch\" (1977) \u2013 UK No. 6\n\"Jiggery Pokery\" / \"Porride\" (1977)\n\"Is Anybody There (Vampire Vamp)\" (1978)\n\"Electric Fling\" (1978)\n\"Tokyo Flyer\" (1979)\n\"Falcon\" (1980) \u2013 UK No. 35\n\"Slide\" (1981) \u2013 UK No. 50\n\"Downside Up\" (1981)\n\"Rock Me Down To Rio\" / \"Riding on a Fantasy\" (1981)\n\"Perfumed Garden\" (1982) \u2013 UK No. 45\n\"Tears & Rain\" / \"Hunger 4 Your Jungle Love\" (1982)\n\"Sam The Samba Man\" (1983)\n\"Messages from the Stars\" (1983) \u2013 UK No. 42\n\"Questions (What'cha Gonna Do?)\" (1983)\n\"Rising Star\" / \"Winter Love '84\" (1984)\n\"Sam The Samba Man '84\" / \"Dream Street\" (1984)\n\"Are You Satisfied?

            "content": "Galliformes is an order of heavy-bodied ground-feeding birds that includes turkey, grouse, chicken, New World quail and Old World quail, ptarmigan, partridge, pheasant, junglefowl and the Cracidae. The name derives from \"gallus\", Latin for \"cock\" or \"rooster\". Common names are gamefowl or gamebirds, landfowl, gallinaceous birds, or galliforms. \"Wildfowl\" or just \"fowl\" are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to waterfowl (Anseriformes), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds. This group has about 290 species, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world's continents (except for the innermost deserts and perpetual ice). They are rarer on islands, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from oceanic islands\u2014unless introduced there by humans. Several species have been domesticated during their long and extensive relationships with humans.\nThis order contains five families: Phasianidae (including chicken, quail, partridges, pheasants, turkeys, peafowl and grouse), Odontophoridae (New World quails), Numididae (guineafowl), Cracidae (including chachalacas and curassows), and Megapodiidae (incubator birds like mallee fowl and brush-turkeys). They are important as seed dispersers and predators in the ecosystems they inhabit, and are often reared as game birds by humans for their meat and eggs and for recreational hunting. Many gallinaceous species are skilled runners and escape predators by running rather than flying. Males of most species are more colorful than the females. Males often have elaborate courtship behaviors that include strutting, fluffing of tail or head feathers, and vocal sounds. They are mainly nonmigratory.\n\n\n== Systematics and evolution ==\n\nThe living Galliformes were once divided into seven or more families. Despite their distinctive appearance, grouse and turkeys probably do not warrant separation as families due to their recent origin from partridge- or pheasant-like birds. The turkeys became larger after their ancestors colonized temperate and subtropical North America, where pheasant-sized competitors were absent. The ancestors of grouse, though, adapted to harsh climates and could thereby colonize subarctic regions. Consequently, the Phasianidae are expanded in current taxonomy to include the former Tetraonidae and Meleagrididae as subfamilies.\nThe Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes together make up the Galloanserae. They are basal among the living neognathous birds, and normally follow the Paleognathae (ratites and tinamous) in modern bird classification systems. This was first proposed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy and has been the one major change of that proposed scheme that was almost universally adopted. However, the Galliformes as they were traditionally delimited are called Gallomorphae in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, which splits the Cracidae and Megapodiidae as an order \"Craciformes\". This is not a natural group, however, but rather an erroneous result of the now-obsolete phenetic methodology employed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. Phenetic studies do not distinguish between plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters, which leads to basal lineages appearing as monophyletic groups.\nHistorically, the buttonquails (Turnicidae), mesites (Mesitornithidae) and the hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) were placed in the Galliformes, too. The former are now known to be shorebirds adapted to an inland lifestyle, whereas the mesites are probably closely related to pigeons and doves. The relationships of the hoatzin are entirely obscure, and it is usually treated as a monotypic order Opisthocomiformes to signify this.\n\n\n=== Evolution ===\nThe earliest galliform-like fossils hail from the Late Cretaceous, most notably those of Austinornis lentus. Its partial left tarsometatarsus was found in the Austin Chalk near Fort McKinney, Texas, dating to about 85 million years ago (Mya). This bird was quite certainly closely related to Galliformes, but whether it was a part of these or belongs elsewhere in the little-known galliform branch of Galloanserae is not clear. However, in 2004, Clarke classified it as a member of the larger group Pangalliformes, more closely related to chickens than to ducks, but not a member of the crown group that includes all modern galliformes. Another specimen, PVPH 237, from the Late Cretaceous Portezuelo Formation (Turonian-Coniacian, about 90 Mya) in the Sierra de Portezuelo (Argentina) has also been suggested to be an early galliform relative. This is a partial coracoid of a neornithine bird, which in its general shape and particularly the wide and deep attachment for the muscle joining the coracoid and the humerus bone resembles the more basal lineages of galliforms.\nAdditional galliform-like pangalliformes are represented by extinct families from the Paleogene, namely the Gallinuloididae, Paraortygidae and Quercymegapodiidae. In the early Cenozoic, some additional birds may or may not be early Galliformes, though even if they are, they are unlikely to belong to extant families:\n\u2020Argillipes (London Clay Early Eocene of England)\n\u2020Coturnipes (Early Eocene of England, and Virginia, USA?)\n\u2020Paleophasianus (Willwood Early Eocene of Bighorn County, USA)\n\u2020Percolinus (London Clay Early Eocene of England)\n\u2020Amitabha (Bridger middle Eocene of Forbidden City, USA) \u2013 phasianid?\n\u2020\"Palaeorallus\" alienus (middle Oligocene of Tatal-Gol, Mongolia)\n\u2020Anisolornis (Santa Cruz Middle Miocene of Karaihen, Argentina)\nFrom the mid-Eocene onwards \u2013 about 45 Mya or so, true galliforms are known, and these completely replace their older relatives in the early Neogene. Since the earliest representatives of living galliform families apparently belong to the Phasianidae \u2013 the youngest family of galliforms, the other families of Galliformes must be at least of Early Eocene origin but might even be as old as the Late Cretaceous. The ichnotaxon Tristraguloolithus cracioides is based on fossil eggshell fragments from the Late Cretaceous Oldman Formation of southern Alberta, Canada, which are similar to chachalaca eggs, but in the absence of bone material, their relationships cannot be determined except they are apparently not from a nonavian dinosaur.\nModern genera of phasianids start appearing around the Oligo-/Miocene boundary, roughly 25\u201320 Mya. It is not well known whether the living genera of the other, older, galliform families originated around the same time or earlier, though at least in the New World quails, pre-Neogene forms seem to belong to genera that became entirely extinct later on.\nA number of Paleogene to mid-Neogene fossils are quite certainly Galliformes, but their exact relationships in the order cannot be determined:\n\u2020Galliformes gen. et sp. indet. (Oligocene) \u2013 formerly in Gallinuloides; phasianid?\n\u2020Palaealectoris (Agate Fossil Beds Early Miocene of Sioux County, USA) \u2013 tetraonine?\n\n\n=== List of major taxa ===\n\nFor a long time, the pheasants, partridges, and relatives were indiscriminately lumped in the Phasianidae, variously including or excluding turkeys, grouse, New World quails, and guineafowl, and divided into two subfamilies \u2013 the Phasianinae (pheasant-like forms) and the Perdicinae (partridge-like forms). This crude arrangement was long considered to be in serious need of revision, but even with modern DNA sequence analyses and cladistic methods, the phylogeny of the Phasianidae has resisted complete resolution.\n\nA tentative list of the higher-level galliform taxa, listed in evolutionary sequence, is:\n\u2020Archaeophasianus Lambrecht 1933 (Oligocene?

Thus, the bulk of the Phasianidae can alternatively be treated as a single subfamily Phasianinae. The grouse, turkeys, true pheasants, etc., would then become tribes of this subfamily, similar to how the Coturnicinae are commonly split into a quail and a spurfowl tribe.\nThe partridge of Europe is not closely related to other partridge-like Galliformes is already indicated by its sexually dimorphic coloration and more than 14 rectrices, traits it shares with the other advanced phasianids. However, among these its relationships are obscure; it is entirely unclear whether it is closer to the turkeys or to certain short-tailed pheasants like Ithaginis, Lophophorus, Pucrasia, and Tragopan.\n\n\n== Phylogeny ==\nLiving Galliformes based on the work by John Boyd.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThey are chicken-like in appearance, with rounded bodies and blunt wings, and range in size from small at 15 cm (6 inches) to large at 120 cm (4 feet). They are mainly terrestrial birds and their wings are short and rounded for short-distance flight. Galiforms are anisodactyly like passerines, but some of the adult males grow spurs that points backward.\nGallinaceous birds are arboreal or terrestrial animals; many prefer not to fly, but instead walk and run for locomotion. They live 5\u20138 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity. They can be found worldwide and in a variety of habitats, including forests, deserts, and grasslands. They use visual displays and vocalizations for communication, courtship, fighting, territoriality, and brooding.\nThey have diverse mating strategies: some are monogamous, while others are polygamous or polygynandrous. Male courtship behavior includes elaborate visual displays of plumage. They breed seasonally in accordance with the climate and lay three to 16 eggs per year in nests built on the ground or in trees.\nGallinaceous birds feed on a variety of plant and animal material, which may include fruits, seeds, leaves, shoots, flowers, tubers, roots, insects, snails, worms, lizards, snakes, small rodents, and eggs.\nThese birds vary in size from the diminutive king quail (Coturnix chinensis) (5 in) long and weighing 28\u201340 g (1\u20131.4 oz) to the largest extant galliform species, the North American wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), which may weigh as much as 14 kg (30.5 lb) and may exceed 120 cm (47 in).\nThe galliform bird species with the largest wingspan and largest overall length (including a train of over 6 feet) is most likely the green peafowl (Pavo muticus). Most galliform genera are plump-bodied with thick necks and moderately long legs, with rounded and rather short wings. Grouse, pheasants, francolins, and partridges are typical in their outwardly corpulent silhouettes.\nAdult males of many galliform birds have one to several sharp horny spurs on the back of each leg, which they use for fighting. In several lineages, pronounced sexual dimorphism occurs, and among each galliform clade, the more apomorphic (\"advanced\") lineages tend to be more sexually dimorphic.\n\n\n== Flightlessness ==\nWhile most galliformes are rather reluctant flyers, flightless forms are utterly unknown among the living members of the order. Though they are often mischaracterised as weak-flying, Galliformes are actually highly specialised for their particular flight style, bearing extremely powerful flight muscles, and some species are even migratory.\nNonetheless, a few birds outside the Galliforme crown-group did produce flightlessness.\nThe genus Sylviornis, a huge prehistorically extinct species of New Caledonia, was flightless, but as opposed to most other flightless birds like ratites or island rails which become flightless due to arrested development of their flight apparatus and subsequently evolve to larger size, Sylviornis seems to have become flightless simply due to its bulk, with the wing reduction following a consequence, not the reason for its flightlessness.\nThe gigantic australian mihirungs, which may be closer to Galliformes than to Anseriformes as traditionally expected, achieved flightlessness more traditionally, strongly reducing their wings and keel. They were massive herbivorous birds, among the largest avian dinosaurs of all time.\n\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\nMost of the galliform birds are more or less resident, but some of the smaller temperate species (such as quail) do migrate over considerable distances. Altitudinal migration is evidently quite common amongst montane species, and a few species of subtropical and subarctic regions must reach their watering and/or foraging areas through sustained flight. Species known to make extensive flights include the ptarmigans, sage-grouse (Centrocercus), crested partridge, green peafowl, crested argus, mountain peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron inopinatum), koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha), Reeves's pheasant and (Syrmaticus reevesii). Other species\u2014most of the New World quails (also known as the toothed quails), the enigmatic stone partridge (Ptilopachus petrosus) of Africa, guineafowl, and eared pheasants (Crossoptilon)\u2014are all notable for their daily excursions on foot which may take them many miles in a given day.\nSome Galliformes are adapted to grassland habitat, and these genera are remarkable for their long, thin necks, long legs, and large, wide wings. Fairly unrelated species like the crested fireback (Lophura ignita), vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum), and malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata) are outwardly similar in their body types (see also convergent evolution).\nMost species that show only limited sexual dimorphism are notable for the great amount of locomotion required to find food throughout the majority of the year. Those species that are highly sedentary but with marked ecological transformations over seasons exhibit marked distinct differences between the sexes in size and/or appearance. Eared-pheasants, guineafowls, toothed quails, and the snow partridge (Lerwa lerwa) are examples of limited sexual differences and requirements for traveling over wide terrain to forage.\nThe bronze-tailed peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron chalcurum), snow partridge, painted spurfowl (Galloperdix lunulata), and crimson-headed partridge (Haematortyx sanguiniceps) are notable in their habit of moving around as pairs not only on foot, but also in the air.\n\n\n=== Winter ecology ===\nGallinaceous birds are well adapted to regions with cold winters. Their larger size, increased plumage, and lower activity levels help them to withstand the cold and conserve energy. Under such conditions, they are able to change their feeding strategy to that of a ruminant. This allows them to feed on and extract energy and nutrients from coarse, fibrous plant material, such as buds, twigs, and conifer needles. This provides a virtually unlimited source of accessible food and requires little energy to harvest.\n\n\n=== Food and feeding ===\n\nHerbivorous to slightly omnivorous galliforms, comprising the majority of the group, are typically stoutly built and have short, thick bills primarily adapted for foraging on the ground for rootlets or the consumption of other plant material such as heather shoots. The young birds will also take insects.\nPeafowl, junglefowl and most of the subtropical pheasant genera have very different nutritional requirements from typical Palearctic genera. The Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) has been observed digging in the rotting wood of deadfall in a similar manner to woodpeckers to extract invertebrates, even bracing itself with aid of its squared tail. The cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi), crested argus (Rheinardia ocellata), the crested partridge (Rollulus roulroul) and the crested guineafowl (Guttera pucherani) are similar ecologically to the Himalayan monal in that they too forage in rotting wood for termites, ant and beetle larvae, molluscs, crustaceans and young rodents.\nTypical peafowl (Pavo), most of the peacock-pheasants (Polyplectron), the Bulwer's pheasant (Lophura bulweri), the ruffed pheasants (Chrysolophus) and the hill partridges (Arborophila) have narrow, relatively delicate bills, poorly suited for digging. These galliform genera prefer instead to capture live invertebrates in leaf litter, in sand, or shallow pools or along stream banks. These genera are also outwardly similar in that they each have exceptionally long, delicate legs and toes and the tendency to frequent seasonally wet habitats to forage, especially during chick-rearing. The blue peafowl (Pavo cristatus) is famed in its native India for its appetite for snakes \u2013 even poisonous cobras \u2013 which it dispatches with its strong feet and sharp bill. The Lady Amherst's pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae), green peafowl (Pavo muticus), Bulwer's pheasant and the crestless fireback (Lophura erythrophthalma) are notable for their aptitude to forage for crustaceans such as crayfish and other aquatic small animals in shallow streams and amongst rushes in much the same manner as some members of the rail family (Rallidae). Similarly, although wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) have a diet primarily of vegetation, they will eat insects, mice, lizards, and amphibians, wading in water to hunt for the latter. Domestic hens (Gallus domesticus) share this opportunistic behaviour and will eat insects, mice, worms, and amphibians.\n\nThe tragopans (Tragopan), mikado pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado), and several species of grouse and ptarmigan are exceptional in their largely vegetarian and arboreal foraging habitats; grouse are especially notable for being able to feed on plants rich in terpenes and quinones \u2013 such as sagebrush or conifers \u2013, which are often avoided by other herbivores. Many species of moderate altitudes\u2014for example the long-tailed pheasants of the genus Syrmaticus\u2014also find a great deal of their daily nutritional requirements in the tree canopies, especially during the snowy and rainy periods when foraging on the ground is dangerous and less than fruitful for a variety of reasons. Although members of the genus Syrmaticus are capable of subsisting almost entirely on vegetarian materials for months at a time, this is not true for many of the subtropical genera. For example, the great argus (Argusianus argus) and crested argus may do most of their foraging during rainy months in the canopy of the jungle, as well. There they are known to forage on slugs, snails, ants, and amphibians to the exclusion of plant material. How they forage in the forest canopy during the rainy months is unknown.\n\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nMost galliforms are very prolific, with clutches regularly exceeding 10 eggs in many species. In contrast to most birds which are \u2013 at least for a particular breeding season \u2013 monogamous, galliforms are often polygynous or polygamous. Such species can be recognized by their pronounced sexual dimorphism.\nGalliform young are very precocious and roam with their mothers \u2013 or both parents in monogamous species \u2013 mere hours after hatching. The most extreme case are the Megapodiidae, where the adults do not brood, but leave incubation to mounds of rotting vegetation, volcanic ash, or hot sand. The young must dig out of the nest mounds after hatching, but they emerge from the eggs fully feathered, and upon leaving the mound, they are able to fly considerable distances.\n\n\n== Common species ==\n\nGrouse and ptarmigans Family Tetraonidae\nGrouse, ptarmigans, and prairie chickens are all chicken-like birds with short, curved, strong bills, part of the family Tetraonidae. This group includes 25 species residing mostly in North America. They are mainly ground-dwellers and have short, rounded wings for brief flights. They are well adapted to winter by growing feather \u201csnowshoes\u201d on their feet and roosting beneath the snow. They range in size from the 13-inch white-tailed ptarmigan to the 28-inch sage grouse. Their plumage is dense and soft and is most commonly found in shades of red, brown, and gray to camouflage to the ground. They are polygamous and male courtship behavior includes strutting and dancing and aggressive fighting for possession of females. The typical clutch size is between seven and 12 eggs.\nTurkeys Family Meleagrididae\nTurkeys are large, long-legged birds that can grow up to four feet in height and weigh up to 30 lbs in the wild. They have a long, broad, rounded tail with 14-19 blunt feathers. They have a naked, wrinkled head and feathered body. The North American wild turkey \u2013 Meleagris gallopavo \u2013 has five distinct subspecies (Eastern, Rio Grande, Florida [Osceola], Merriam's, and Gould's). Hybrids also exist where the ranges of these subspecies overlap. All are native only to North America, though transplanted populations exist elsewhere. Their plumage differs slightly by subspecies, but is generally dark to black for males, with buff to cream highlights, and generally drab brown for females. The feathers are quite iridescent and can take on distinct reddish/copper hues in sunlight. Their feathers are well defined with broad, square ends, giving the bird the appearance of being covered in scales. Males have a \u201cbeard\u201d of coarse black bristles hanging from the center of their upper breasts and tend to have more vibrantly colored plumage than do females. They breed in the spring and their typical clutch size is between 10 and 12 eggs. The ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata), a different species of turkey, currently exists only in a portion of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula. After the 19th and early 20th centuries, wild turkey populations dropped significantly because of hunting and habitat loss. However, populations now flourish again due to hunting management and transplanting. The ocellated turkey, not commonly hunted, is currently threatened due to ongoing habitat loss in the Yucutan.\nPheasants, quail, and partridges Family Phasianidae\nThe family is divided into four groups: 30 species of new world quail, residing between Paraguay and Canada, 11 species of Old World quails in Africa, Australia, and Asia, 94 species of partridges, and 48 species of pheasants. This family includes a wide range of bird sizes from a 5 \u00bd-inch quail to pheasants up to almost 30 inches. Pheasants and quails have heavy, round bodies and rounded wings. Though they have short legs, they are very fast runners when escaping predators.\nChachalacas Family Cracidae\nChachalacas are found in the chaparral ecosystems from southern Texas through Mexico and Costa Rica. They are mainly arboreal and make their nests in trees five to 15 feet above the ground. They are large, long-legged birds that can grow up to 26 in long. They have long tails and are chicken-like in appearance. Their frail-looking yet sturdy nests are made of sticks and leaves. Their clutch size is three or four eggs. The males make a unique, loud, mating call that give them their name. Chachalacas feed mainly on berries, but also eat insects. They are a popular game bird, as their flesh is good to eat. They are also commonly domesticated as pets.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAgnolin, Federico L.; Novas, Fernando E. & Lio, Gabriel (2006): Neornithine bird coracoid from the Upper Cretaceous of Patagonia.

In order of seniority of legitimate descent from their progenitor, Ludwig I, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1532-1605), they were the:\nPrinces (F\u00fcrsten) zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, descended from Count Georg (1565-1631)\nPrinces (F\u00fcrsten) zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn, descended from Count Christian Ludwig (1725-1797)\nCounts zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, descended from Count Georg Ernst (1735-1792)\nPrinces (F\u00fcrsten) zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein, descended from Count Ludwig (1571-1634)\nSome of these lines had junior branches, dynastic and non-dynastic, the latter including families whose right to the princely title was recognized by the Russian, Prussian and Bavarian monarchies, whereas other morganatic branches used lesser titles in Germany.\nOn the death of Ludwig, 3rd Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn in 1912, the eldest of his three sons, Hereditary Prince August (1868-1947), became 4th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein and head of the third branch of the House of Sayn. Being a childless bachelor, the elder of whose two younger brothers, Georg (1873-1960), had married morganatically, while the younger, Wilhelm (1877-1958), was 49 and yet unmarried, August preserved the name and heritage of his branch of the House of Sayn by adopting Christian Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1908-1953). He was the second son of the late head of the entire House of Sayn, Richard, 4th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1882-1925), whose eldest son, Gustav Albrecht, 5th Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg (1907-1944) had inherited the senior line's fortune and position.\nIn November 1960 Christian Heinrich, being the divorced father of three daughters by his dynastic marriage to Beatrix Grafin von Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen (1921-2006), married Dagmar Prinzessin zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein (1919-2002), elder daughter of his adopted father's younger brother, Georg, who died seven months before the wedding. As Georg's children by his morganatic wife, Marie R\u00fchm, (created Baroness von Freusburg by the reigning Prince of Lippe in 1916) had been de-morganatized by declaration of their uncle August on 11 February 1947, her marriage to Christian Heinrich was deemed a dynastic match, ensuring that their son Bernhart would be born in compliance with the house laws of his adoptive ancestors, the Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohensteins, as well as being a grandson of the last dynastic male of that family, Prince Georg.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== References ==",

This brought the membership of the College of Cardinals to a total of 66, 33 Italians and 33 non-Italians: seven French, seven German, four American, four Spanish, two English, two Polish, and one each of Belgian, Hungarian, Irish, Portuguese, Brazilian, Dutch, and Canadian.\nGeorge Mundelein (1872\u20131939)\nPatrick Joseph Hayes (1867\u20131938)\n\n\n== 30 March 1925 ==\nPius named a pair of Spanish archbishops cardinals on 30 March 1925.

            "content": "Northern Spirit Radio (NSR) is an organization founded in Eau Claire, Wisconsin by Mark Helpsmeet that creates radio programs. According to NSR's website, \"NSR promotes world healing by broadcasting inspirational and educational voices of peace and social justice, using the language of personal story, music, and spirituality.\"\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Creating the show ===\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened a filing window for obtaining low power FM (LPFM) radio licenses in January 2000. An environmental and activist organization by the name of Northern Thunder in Eau Claire, Wisconsin applied for an LPFM for the local station called WHYS Radio. The FCC granted the license, and, once the headquarters for the station were completed, they began broadcasting in spring 2005.\nDuring discussion about potential programs to be included in the station's schedule, the possibility of a Sunday program related to spirituality and social action was raised, and local Quaker activist Mark Helpsmeet's name was suggested as a potential host. He was invited to submit a proposal, but Helpsmeet declined their invitation, stating that he was too busy at that point to pursue a future in broadcasting.\nShortly thereafter, Helpsmeet had asked for and began meeting with a clearness committee to help discern his future work. A second invitation to create programming for WHYS Radio came, so with the clearness committee's support, and with support from the general community, the WHYS Radio programming committee eventually agreed to the offer of two one-hour-long weekly programs by Helpsmeet. On July 26, 2005, Eau Claire Friends Meeting (ECFM), a local monthly meeting that Helpsmeet had been part of, united in creating a support committee for NSR and in taking the work under the care of ECFM.\n\n\n=== Early stages ===\nHelpsmeet first created NSR's first program, \"Spirit in Action\", which aired on July 31, 2005. His next program, \"Song of the Soul\", followed and aired on August 14 of the same year. The shows respectively feature a variety of people who dedicate themselves to lives \"of fruitful service, of peace, community, compassion, creative action and progressive efforts\" and songs that describe people's spiritual journeys through life that have truly spoken to them in their depths. For the first year of NSR programming, a support committee was provided by ECFM. ECFM then requested a support committee (which is also known as an \"anchoring committee\") from the regional association of Quakers with which ECFM is affiliated, Northern Yearly Meeting. Northern Yearly Meeting's Ministry and Nurture Committee appointed a support committee, which Helpsmeet met with regularly until the anchoring function shifted back to ECFM in 2013.\nAfter two years of making programs, Helpsmeet made NSR programs available for syndication. WDRT and WIDE-LP were among the first stations to start carrying the shows, with KLOI-LP Lopez Island Community Radio and WKNH of Keene State College following close behind. Several more stations began carrying NSR programs when the shows started being shared on The Pacifica AudioPort in 2008.\n\n\n=== Incorporation and nonprofit status ===\nIn 2012, the anchoring committee and Helpsmeet met and decided that it was time for NSR to move forward and become incorporated. A board of directors was established and Northern Spirit Radio was incorporated in Wisconsin on May 17, 2013.\nFollowing its incorporation, the NSR board of directors prepared and submitted an application for 501(c)(3) status, which the IRS approved in July 2014.\n\n\n== Broadcasting locations ==\nAs of February 2015, NSR airs on approximately 20 stations across the United States, including three in California and Wisconsin, two in Iowa, Vermont, and Washington, and others in Colorado, Missouri, New York, and Virginia.\n\n\n== International connections ==\nWhile NSR is based in Wisconsin, the station follows stories of social justice and peace from across the world. Helpsmeet has interviewed people from Australia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cuba, England, Estonia, Israel, and Rwanda. Since the broadcasts are made available online via NSR's official website and podcasts, its following is worldwide.\n\n\n== Activism ==\nNSR has featured many guests on \"Spirit in Action\" that focus on current social issues faced by people across the United States and around the rest of the world. Education, racial and gender equality, equal marriage, environmentalism, and the conflicts in the Middle East only encompass a few topics that the show covers. Some examples of interviews that include these themes are \"Fruitful Lesbian Lives\", \"War Taxes, Injustice in Palestine, Racism - A Life of Faith, Joy, & Service\", and \"Protecting Oklahoma from the Keystone XL Pipeline\".\n\n\n== Musicians ==\nThe Song of the Soul program typically features interviews with a wide range of musicians, some nationally known, some known primarily within limited circles. Nationally known performers have included Cris Williamson, Peggy Seeger, Red Grammer, Gordon Bok, Kim and Reggie Harris, Peter Alsop, Bob Franke, Fred Small, David Rovics, Charlie King, Susan Werner, Magpie, Sonny Ochs, Carrie Newcomer, among many others.\n\n\n== Spirituality ==\nNSR programs highlight, in addition to the activism or musical aspects of the guests, exploration of their religious or spiritual beliefs, motivations, or practices. Occasionally this has included guests who are especially known for their theological studies and writings, like John Shelby Spong, Marcus Borg, Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, Gary Dorrien, Philip Gulley, Ken Stone, and others.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWHYS Eau Claire Community Radio",

            "content": "The Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey team is the hockey team that represents the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n\n== History ==\nOn October 8, 1999, the Bulldogs played the Wisconsin Badgers in the first ever Women's WCHA conference game at the Kohl Center in Madison, WI. It was the highest attended game of the season (3,892) and resulted in an 8\u20131 defeat of the Badgers.\nIn 2006, the Wisconsin Badgers became the first team outside the state of Minnesota to win the Women's Frozen Four championship. The Badgers defeated the defending champions, the Minnesota Golden Gophers, by a score of 3\u20130 at Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nOn January 28, 2012, the Wisconsin Badgers broke the NCAA women's hockey attendance record for the third consecutive year with 12,402 fans in attendance. The game was part of a two-game sweep of the Bemidji State Beavers. The previous record for most fans to watch a women's college hockey game at the Kohl Center was 10,668. That record was set on January 29, 2011.\nOn November 6, 2016, Ann-Renee Desbiens achieved career shutout number 44, breaking Noora Raty\u2019s record for most NCAA career shutouts.\nAn 8-2 win on December 4, 2016 against their rivals, the Minnesota Golden Gophers resulted in a career milestone. Playing in front of a sellout crowd at Labahn Arena, Sarah Nurse scored a hat trick, becoming the first player in program history to score a hat trick against Minnesota. It marked the first time that Wisconsin scored eight goals in a game since October 11, 2015 against Ohio State, as five different Badgers scored at least one goal.\n\n\n== Season by season results ==\n\n* Johnson took a one-year leave to coach the 2010 US Women's Olympic team.\n\n\n== Frozen Four ==\nWisconsin appeared in the Frozen Four championship in the following years:\n\n\n== Current roster ==\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\n\n=== WCHA honors ===\nAnnie Pankowski, 2015 WCHA Rookie of the Year\nAnn-Ren\u00e9e Desbiens, WCHA Player of the Year \n\n\n==== WCHA All-Star teams ====\nBlayre Turnbull, 2015 All-WCHA First Team\nBrittany Ammerman, 2015 ALL-WCHA SECOND TEAM\nAnnie Pankowski, 2015 ALL-WCHA SECOND TEAM\nCourtney Burke, 2015 ALL-WCHA THIRD TEAM\nKarley Sylvester, 2015 ALL-WCHA THIRD TEAM\nAnn-Ren\u00e9e Desbiens, 2015 ALL-WCHA THIRD TEAM\nEmily Clark, 2015 WCHA ALL-ROOKIE TEAM\nAnnie Pankowski, 2015 WCHA ALL-ROOKIE TEAM\n\n\n=== Badger Award ===\nThe Badger Award is a team honor known as Most Inspirational Player award.\n2000: Kerry Weiland\n2001: Jen Mead\n2002: Kathy Devereaux\n2003: Sis Paulsen/Katie Temple\n2004: Molly Engstrom\n2005: Sharon Cole\n2006: Sharon Cole\n2007: Phoebe Monteleone\n2008: Erika Lawler\n2010: Genna Prough\n\n\n=== Frozen Four All-Tournament team ===\n\n\n=== Career Points Leaders (Top Ten All-Time Scorers) ===\n\n\n== Patty Kazmaier Award Winners ==\nSara Bauer \u2013 2007 | Jessie Vetter \u2013 2009 | Meghan Duggan \u2013 2011 | Brianna Decker \u2013 2012 | Ann-Renee Desbiens \u2013 2017 |-\n\n\n== Bob Allen Women's Hockey Player of the Year Winners ==\nJessie Vetter \u2013 2009 | Meghan Duggan \u2013 2011 | Hilary Knight \u2013 2014 | Brianna Decker \u2013 2015 |-\n\n\n== Notable players ==\nSara Bauer- Patty Kazmaier Award winner, 2007 Big Ten Medal of Honor, 2007 NCAA Women's Frozen Four Most Outstanding Player\nBrianna Decker \u2013 2012 Patty Kazmaier Award winner, 2011 second team All-American, 2011\u201312 CCM Hockey Women's Division I first team All-American\nMeghan Duggan \u2013 member 2010 U.S. Olympic team, 2011 Patty Kazmaier Award winner, 2011 NCAA Women's Frozen Four Most Outstanding Player, 2011 first team All-American\nMolly Engstrom \u2013 member 2010 U.S. Olympic team\nAngie Keseley\nHilary Knight \u2013 member 2010 U.S. Olympic team, 2010 WCHA Pre-Season Player of the Year, 2011 NCAA Women's Frozen Four Most Outstanding Player, 2011 first team All-American\nErika Lawler \u2013 member 2010 U.S. Olympic team\nCarla MacLeod \u2013 member 2010 Canadian Olympic team, 2007 Wisconsin Badgers Big Ten Medal of Honor\nMeaghan Mikkelson \u2013 member 2010 Canadian Olympic team\nJessica Ring \u2013 2006 Big Ten Medal of Honor\nBecca Ruegsegger, 2011 NCAA Elite 88 Award\nJessie Vetter \u2013 member 2010 U.S. Olympic team, 2009 Bob Allen Women's Ice Hockey Player of the Year, 2009 Patty Kazmaier Award, 2006, 2009 NCAA Women's Frozen Four Most Outstanding Player\nKerry Weiland \u2013 member 2010 U.S. Olympic team\nJinelle Zaugg-Siergiej \u2013 member 2010 U.S. Olympic team\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey at Wikimedia Commons",

            "content": "The 2S25 Sprut-SD (Russian: 2\u042125 \u00ab\u0421\u043f\u0440\u0443\u0442-\u0421\u0414\u00bb; 2S25 \"Kraken-SD\") is a self-propelled tank destroyer or light tank developed and manufactured by the Russian defence company, Volgograd tractor factory joint stock company, to meet the requirements of the VDV. In mid-2001, the Volgograd tractor plant revealed that the development of the 2S25 lasted several years.\nThe Sprut-SD is designed to defeat tanks, hard-skinned material and enemy manpower by airborne and amphibious landing forces, as well as by specially designated units of ground forces. Its main armament, the Sprut anti-tank gun, is capable of firing APFSDS, HE-Frag, HEAT and ATGM ammunition. This allows the 2S25 to be as powerful as a main battle tank and as maneuverable and amphibious as airborne infantry combat vehicles. The 2S25 can be used by units of ground forces and naval infantry as a light amphibious tank. Currently, the only operators of the 2S25 are the Russian airborne troops with 24 of these vehicles in service. The Republic of Korea and the Indian military have expressed interest in acquiring the 2S25 Sprut-SD.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1990s, the Volgograd tractor plant created a new self-propelled tank destroyer based on a modified prototype light tank classified as Object 934. The plant was also the designer and manufacturer of the BMD-1, BMD-2, BMD-3 and latest BMD-4 airborne combat vehicles that are used by the Russian Air Assault Divisions. After the completion of modifying the chassis, it received the index \"Object 952\". The turret piece of the machinery was developed in the Yekaterinburg artillery plant number 9. In mid-2001, it was stated that the Volgograd tractor plant had been working on the 2S25 for about seven years. Recent information has indicated that production of the BMD-4 airborne combat vehicle has been transferred to the Kurgan Machine Construction Plant where production of the BMP-3 armored fighting vehicle and its variants are currently undertaken for the local and export markets. As far as it is known, production of the 2S25 self-propelled anti-tank gun is still being carried out at the Volgograd tractor plant. One of its first trials took place May 8, 2001 on the \"Prudboy\" tank firing range located North Caucasian military district for the representatives of the power ministries of Russia and foreign military and diplomatic corps from 14 other countries of Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.\nAccording to Russian information, the Russian Army placed an initial contract for a total of 15 2S25 SPATG in three batches of five vehicles each in 2005. This was followed by a second batch of 45 units with the total requirement being for up to 85\u2013110 units. However, there were only 4 batteries (24 vehicles) in service with the airborne forces as of 2009. In 2010, the cancellation of further procurement was announced as well as the termination of release due to a fire caused by a fuel leakage on one of the vehicles after a military parade on Red Square. The cancellation of further purchases was later denied by VDV commander Vladimir Shamarov in an interview with RIA Novosti military commentator Ilya Kramnik. Serial production starts 2018.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe 2S25 is based on the chassis of the BMD-3 Infantry fighting vehicle which is also produced by the Volgograd tractor factory and in service with the Russian airborne troops. Notable distinctions from the BMD-3 are the armament, the fire control system and the addition of two wheels to each side of the vehicle; which increases to 7 on each side. At the front of the chassis is where the crew is located. The turret and ammunition occupies the middle of the vehicle, while the engine-transmission compartment is towards the rear. The driver has a hatch on the front deck; the commander and gunner have hatches on the turret deck. In the stowed position, the commander sits to the right of the driver while the gunner sits to the left. Each member of crew has available the built-in the roof observant instruments with the day and night channels. Standard equipment includes an electronic NBC protection system to ensure survivability of the crew in case of a nuclear fallout.\n\n\n=== Armament ===\n\nThe 2S25 Sprut-SD is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a 125 mm anti-tank gun. The gun is fitted with an autoloader, which ensures high rate of fire of 6\u22128 rounds per minute with both conventional projectiles and rounds with guided missiles. It is completely stabilized in the vertical and horizontal planes and conducts fire with the same 125 mm separate case ammunition loadings, which are used for the 2A46 smoothbore tank gun. With the fire control system featuring this stabilization of the elevation and azimuth, it also includes a laser rangefinder and a ballistic computer that provides ever-changing data about the target. The two-plane stabilization of the commander's sight is aligned with the laser sight for aiming the 125 mm shells onto the laser rangefinder.\nThe main armament of the 2S25 is a 125 mm smoothbore 2A75 tank gun which is a derivative of the 125 mm 2A46 tank gun installed on other Russian main battle tanks. The angles of elevation and depression for the anti-tank gun are +15\u00b0 and \u22125\u00b0 respectively. When aimed towards the stern of the vehicle, the elevation and depression of the gun changes to +17\u00b0 and \u22123\u00b0 respectively. Given the need to install a gun to a substantially lighter chassis, designers created a new recoil device with a new ejector and thermal insulation jacket; it lacks a muzzle brake. The ammunition of the 2A75 includes laser guided missiles like the 9M119 Svir; providing a maximum range of 4 km for defeating armored targets. Reloading the main gun is completed by means of a horizontal autoloader mounted behind the turret. It can carry a total of 40 rounds for the main armament with 22 ready to use in the autoloader. In case the autoloader is no longer intact, manual loading is possible at the cost of a substantially longer reload time. A coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun mounted to the left side of the main armament serves as the secondary armament of the 2S25; equipped with one tape of 2000 rounds.\n\n\n=== Mobility ===\n\nThe weight of the 2S25 is 18 tonnes which is comparable to that of infantry fighting vehicles. Like the BMD-3, the 2S25 features hydropneumatic suspension with a variable height clearance of 190\u2013590 mm within 6\u20137 seconds to reduce visibility. Hydropneumatic suspension provides high smoothness while driving and dampens recoil of the main gun. Suspension on each side consists of seven single rollers, four support rollers, rear wheel drive and a front-mounted steering wheel. There are hydraulic track adjusters in assistance for greater mobility. In the engine-transmission compartment, multi-fuel diesel engine 2V-06-2S installed, which develops a power of 510 hp (380 kW). It features an automatic transmission that has five gears forward and five gears reverse.\nWhile driving, the 2S25 can reach a top speed of 71 kilometres per hour (44 mph) on an even road; the average speed being 45\u221250 km/h when driving off-road. The vehicle exerts a ground pressure of 0.36 to 0.53 kg/cm\u00b2 depending on the type of tracks. It can overcome vertical obstacles as tall as 0.8 metres (2.6 ft) and cross 2.8 metres (9.2 ft) trenches. Like many other Russian armored fighting vehicles, the Sprut-SD is completely amphibious and moves with the help of two water jets that allow it to reach a speed of 8\u201310 km/h depending on the state of the currents. To increase the buoyancy, wheels are with airtight chambers and powerful water pumps; extracting water from the lower chassis. The vehicle is sea worthy and can cross water obstacles without preparation in a sea state of up to 3. While waterborne, the 2S25 retains the capability of firing the gun within a \u00b135\u00b0 sector towards the front of the chassis.\n\n\n=== Protection ===\nThe hull of the 2S25 self-propelled anti-tank gun is composed of welded aluminum armor with a composite skin to maintain a light weight. Through the frontal arc, 40\u00b0 left and right of the frontal armor provides protection against attack from 23 mm weapons at 500 m (550 yd) and against small arms fire and shell splinters through the remainder of the vehicle. Two banks of three smoke-grenade dischargers are mounted towards the rear on each side of the turret as countermeasures to infrared weapons.\n\n\n== Variants ==\nSprut-SDM1: New version with fire-control system and remote weapon station.\n\n\n== Deployment ==\nPossessing a high power-to-weight ratio of 28.3 hp/tonne, the 2S25 can operate in high altitudes of up to 4000 m, while the installed rubber-clad shoes or snow-riding tracks expand the vehicle's capabilities in various climates. According to the manufacturer, the 2S25 can also be employed as a light amphibious tank by rapid deployment forces, airborne, marine and special purpose units. With its low weight, it can become essential in mountains and swamps regions, where heavy equipment cannot travel. The 2S25 is designed to be parachuted from aircraft such as the Il-76 with the crew inside, allowing nearly immediate combat readiness upon landing to provide high firepower alongside paratroopers.\nLike other tank destroyers, the Sprut-SD is designed to fight and destroy modern main battle tanks such as the M1A2 Abrams or the Merkava IV. The large caliber can be used to destroy armored personnel carriers and other mobile armored targets as well; giving fire support to paratroopers at any time. The 2S25 can be used to destroy strongholds and defensive structures using its Sprut anti-tank gun. While amphibious, it can climb onto ships under its own power during a combat mission.\n\n\n== Operators ==\n Russia\nRussian airborne troops \u2013 24 vehicles were in service during 2009 with further orders being cancelled in 2010. In 2013, the Russian airborne troops ordered a new 125 mm self-propelled gun to the replace 2S25; based on the BMD-4 chassis with a 2A46M-5 125 mm gun.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBMD-4 \u2013 Current generation airborne combat vehicle\nBMPT \u2013 Current generation tank support fighting vehicle\nBTR-90 \u2013 Current generation armored personnel carrier\nT-90 \u2013 Current generation main battle tank\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nRussia pushes airdrop anti-tank gun - IHS Jane's 360\nSelf-propelled antitank gun SPTP 2S25 \u00abSprut-SD\u00bb: Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation\n2S25 Sprut-SD - REDSTARS (In French)",

The canal connects at both ends to the River Ill, thus surrounding the Grande \u00cele that lies at the historic centre of the city.\nThe canal was originally an arm of the River Ill. Initially the bank on the inner, or city, side of the arm was fortified. In the thirteenth century a further wall was built along the middle of the channel. This fortified wall became known as the Faux Rempart or false rampart. Between 1831 and 1832, the mayor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Turckheim removed the Faux Rempart in order to \"allow a spacious navigation channel and freight transport within the city.\" In 1840, the canal was opened to navigation.\nIn its 2-kilometre (1.2 mi) length, the canal is crossed by 13 bridges, and passes through a single lock. Navigation is officially restricted to passenger trip boats only, which operate frequent circular cruises round the Grande \u00cele and through the historic Petite France district of the city.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of canals in France\n\n\n== References ==",

He was born between 415 and 405 BC, the son of Andron, who was a member of the Four Hundred and an associate of Theramenes. Androtion was probably Andron's first son, and seems to have inherited his fortune. In the late 390s or early 380s BC, he studied under Isocrates. He may have been the author of a work on agriculture which survives in fragmentary form.\nAndrotion began his political career not long before 385, and the first position we can place him as holding is that of epistates, some time in the 370s BC. Androtion held various other positions during his career, including governing Arkesine on Amorgos for at least two years up to 357/6, and being a member of the boule in 356/5 BC.\nIn 355/4, Androtion was brought to trial by Euktemon and Diodorus, accused of illegally proposing a crown be awarded to the Council of Five Hundred at the end of its term of office. The prosecution speech, composed by Demosthenes, survives as speech Against Androtion, and it is a major source of information about his career up to this point. Androtion was acquitted, and was appointed as an ambassador to Mausolus, the ruler of Caria.\nHe is said to have gone into exile at Megara, and to have composed an Atthis, or annalistic account of Attica from the earliest times to his own days (Pausanias vi. 7; x. 8). It is disputed whether the annalist and orator are identical. Professor Gaetano De Sanctis (in L'Attide di Androzione e un papiro di Oxyrhynchos, Turin, 1908) attributes to Androtion, the Atthidographer, a 4th-century historical fragment, discovered by B. P. Grenfell and A. S. Hunt (Oxyrhynchus Papyri, vol. v.). Strong arguments against this view are set forth by E. M. Walker in the Classical Review, May 1908.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHarding, Phillip (1976). \"Androtion's Political Career\". Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte. 25 (2): 194.",

Diners may say \"bap bokka juseyo\" (\ubc25 \ubcf6\uc544 \uc8fc\uc138\uc694. literally \"Please fry rice.\") after eating main dishes cooked on a tabletop stove, such as dak-galbi (spicy stir-fried chicken) or nakji-bokkeum (stir-fried octopus), then cooked rice along with gimgaru (seaweed flakes) and sesame oil will be added directly into the remains of the main dish, stir-fried and scorched.\n\n\n=== By ingredients ===\nThe name of the most prominent ingredient other than cooked rice often appears at the very front of the name of the dish. Kimchi-bokkeum-bap (kimchi fried rice), beoseot-bokkeum-bap (mushroom fried rice), saeu-bokkeum-bap (shrimp fried rice) are some examples. When there isn't the main or special ingredient, the dish is usually called by either just bokkeum-bap (fried rice) or yachae-bokkeum-bap (vegetable fried rice).\n\n\n=== By style ===\nKorean Chinese fried rice, often called junggukjip bokkeum-bap (\uc911\uad6d\uc9d1 \ubcf6\uc74c\ubc25; \"Chinese restaurant fried rice\") in South Korea, is characterized by the smoky flavor from the use of wok on high heat, eggs scrambled or fried in the scallion-infused oil, and the jajang sauce (a thick black sauce used in jajangmyeon) served with the dish.\nAnother popular dish, cheolpan-bokkeum-bap (\ucca0\ud310 \ubcf6\uc74c\ubc25; \"iron griddle fried rice\") is influenced by the style of Japanese teppanyaki. The Japanese word teppan (\u9244\u677f; \"iron griddle\") and the Korean word cheolpan (\ucca0\ud310; \"iron griddle\") are cognates, sharing the same Chinese characters.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCh\u0101han\nCh\u01ceof\u00e0n\nkhao phat\nnasi goreng\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Jerome Rothenberg (born December 11, 1931) is an American poet, translator and anthologist, noted for his work in the fields of ethnopoetics and performance poetry.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJerome Rothenberg was born and raised in New York City, the son of Polish-Jewish immigrant parents and is a descendant of the Talmudist Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg. He attended the City College of New York, graduating in 1952, and in 1953 he received a Master's Degree in Literature from the University of Michigan. Rothenberg served in the U.S. Army in Mainz, Germany from 1953 to 1955, after which he did further graduate study at Columbia University, finishing in 1959. He lived in New York City until 1972, when he moved first to the Allegany Seneca Reservation in western New York State, and later to San Diego, California, where he lives presently.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIn the late 1950s, he published translations of German poets, including the first English translation of poems by Paul Celan and G\u00fcnter Grass, among others. He also founded Hawk's Well Press and the magazines Poems from the Floating World and some/thing, the latter with David Antin, publishing work by important American avant-garde poets, as well as his first collection, White Sun Black Sun (1960). He wrote works which he described as deep image in the 1950s and early 1960s, during that time publishing eight more collections, and the first of his extensive anthologies of traditional and modern poetry, Technicians of the Sacred: A Range of Poems from Africa, America, Asia, & Oceania (1968, revised and expanded 1985). By the end of the 1960s he had also become active in poetry performance, had adapted a play (The Deputy by Rolf Hochhuth, 1964) for Broadway production, and had opened the range of his experimental work well beyond the earlier \u201cdeep image\u201d poetry.\n\n\n== Ethnopoetics and anthologies ==\nTechnicians of the Sacred (1968), which signalled the beginning of an approach to poetry that Rothenberg, in collaboration with George Quasha, named \u201cethnopoetics,\u201d went beyond the standard collection of folk songs to include visual and sound poetry and the texts and scenarios for ritual events. Some 150 pages of commentaries gave context to the works included and placed them as well in relation to contemporary and experimental work in the industrial and postindustrial West. Over the next ten years, Rothenberg also founded and with Dennis Tedlock co-edited Alcheringa, the first magazine of ethnopoetics (1970\u201373, 1975ff.) and edited further anthologies, including:- Shaking the Pumpkin: Traditional Poetry of the Indian North Americas (1972, 2014); A Big Jewish Book: Poems & Other Visions of the Jews from Tribal Times to the Present (revised and republished as Exiled in the Word, 1977 and 1989); America a Prophecy: A New Reading of American Poetry from Pre-Columbian Times to the Present (1973, 2012), co-edited with George Quasha; and Symposium of the Whole: A Range of Discourse Toward An Ethnopoetics (1983), co-edited with Diane Rothenberg. Rothenberg\u2019s approach throughout was to treat these large collections as deliberately constructed assemblages or collages, on the one hand, and as manifestos promulgating a complex and multiphasic view of poetry on the other. Speaking of their relation to his work as a whole, he later wrote of the anthology thus conceived as \u201can assemblage or pulling together of poems & people & ideas about poetry (& much else) in the words of others and in [my] own words. That imago \u2013 that representation of where we've been and what we've lived through \u2013 is something in fact that I would stand by \u2013 like any poem.\u201d\n\n\n== The middle years, 1970\u20131990 ==\nRothenberg has continued to be a prolific poet into the present, publishing over seventy books of poetry, translation, and assemblage since 1970. In that year the first version of his selected poems appeared as Poems for the Game of Silence (2000), and soon after that he became one of the poets published regularly by New Directions. Provoked by his own ethnopoetic anthologies, he began, as he wrote of it, \u201cto construct an ancestral poetry of my own \u2013 in a world of Jewish mystics, thieves, & madmen.\u201d The first work to emerge from that, both thematically and formally, was Poland/1931 (1974), described by the poet David Meltzer as Rothenberg's \u201csurrealist Jewish vaudeville.\u201d Over the next two decades Rothenberg expanded this theme in works such as A Big Jewish Book and Khurbn & Other Poems, the latter an approach to holocaust writing, which had otherwise been no more than a subtext in Poland/1931. He also reexplored American Indian themes in A Seneca Journal (1978), and the relation of his work to Dada and Surrealism culminated in a further cycle of poems, That Dada Strain, in 1983. A merger of experimental sound poetry and ethnopoetics was the basis in the 1970s and 1980s of works composed by an approach that he was calling \u201ctotal translation,\u201d most notably \u201cThe 17 Horse Songs of Frank Mitchell\u201d translated from Navajo with a privileging of sonic effect alongside strict or literal meaning. Compositions such as these became centerpieces of Rothenberg's expanding performance repertory and underlay his critical writings on the poetics of performance, many of which were gathered together in Pre-Faces & Other Writings (1981). During this time and beyond it, he also engaged in a number of collaborations with musicians \u2013 Charlie Morrow, Bertram Turetzky, Pauline Oliveros, and George Lewis, among others \u2013 and took part, sometimes performing, in theatricalizations of his poetry: Poland/1931 for The Living Theater and That Dada Strain for Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Germany and the Center for Theater Science & Research in San Diego and New York. His New Selected Poems 1970-1985, covering the period since Poems for the Game of Silence, appeared in 1986.\n\n\n== Recent work, after 1990 ==\nIn 1987 Rothenberg received his first tenured professorship at the State University of New York in Binghamton, but returned to California in 1989, where he taught for the next ten years as a professor of visual arts and literature at the University of California, San Diego. The works published since 1990 include over fifteen books of his own poetry as well as four books of poetry in translation \u2013 from Schwitters, Lorca, Picasso, and Nezval \u2013 and a book of selected translations, Writing Through, which extends the idea of translation to practices like collage, assemblage, and appropriation. In 1994 he published Gematria. In 1995 and 1998 he published, in collaboration with Pierre Joris, the two-volume anthology-assemblage, Poems for the Millennium: The University of California Book of Modern and Postmodern Poetry, and in 2000, with Steven Clay, A Book of the Book: Some Works & Projections About the Book & Writing. He published a new book of selected essays, Poetics & Polemics 1980-2005, in 2008 and volume three of Poems for the Millennium, co-edited with Jeffrey C. Robinson as a nineteenth-century prequel to the first two volumes, in 2009. Numerous translated editions of his writings have appeared in French, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Portuguese, and other languages, and a complete French edition of Technicians of the Sacred appeared in 2008.

            "content": "Hidden Armenians (Turkish: Gizli Ermeniler) or crypto-Armenians (Armenian: \u056e\u057a\u057f\u0565\u0561\u056c \u0570\u0561\u0575\u0565\u0580 tsptyal hayer; Turkish: Kripto Ermeniler) is an \"umbrella term to describe Turkish people of full or partial ethnic Armenian origin who generally conceal their Armenian identity from wider Turkish society.\" They are mostly descendants of Ottoman Armenians who, at least outwardly, were Islamized (and turkified or kurdified) \"under the threat of physical extermination\" during the Armenian Genocide.\nTurkish journalist Erhan Ba\u015fyurt describes hidden Armenians as \"families (and in some cases, entire villages or neighbourhoods) [...] who converted to Islam to escape the deportations and death marches [of 1915], but continued their hidden lives as Armenians, marrying among themselves and, in some cases, clandestinely reverting to Christianity.\" According to the European Commission 2012 report on Turkey, a \"number of crypto-Armenians have started to use their original names and religion.\" The Economist suggests that the number of Turks who reveal their Armenian background is growing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe western parts of the Armenian Highlands, the traditional homeland of the Armenian people, came under Ottoman (Turkish) control in the 16th century. Armenians remained an overwhelming majority of the area's population until the 17th century, however, their number gradually decreased and by the early 20th century they constituted up to 38% of the population of Western Armenia, designed at the time as the Six vilayets. Turks and Kurds made up a significant part of the population.\n\n\n=== Armenian Genocide ===\nIn 1915 and the following years, the Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated by the Young Turk government in the Armenian Genocide. During the genocide, between 100,000 and 200,000 Armenian women were taken into harems by Muslim husbands and children were converted, forced into slavery, or kidnapped and raised as Turks or Kurds. When relief workers and surviving Armenians started to search for and claim back these Armenian orphans after World War I, only a small percentage were found and reunited, while many others continued to live as Muslims. Additionally, there were cases of entire families converting to Islam to survive the genocide.\n\n\n=== Republican period ===\n\"After converting to Islam, many of the crypto-Armenians said they still faced unfair treatment: their land was often confiscated, the men were humiliated with \"circumcision checks\" in the army and some were tortured.\" Between the 1930s and 1980s, the Turkish government conducted a secret investigation of hidden Armenians.\nThe term \"Crypto-Armenians\" appears as early as 1956.\n\n\n=== Recent developments ===\nIn 2010, Mass was held at Akdamar church for the first time in 95 years. Although the church was reopened as a museum in 2007, after a million dollar restoration, prayers were not allowed until 2010. In September 2010, 2,000 Armenians attended a mass at Akdamar church.\nWhen the Surp Giragos Church was reopened in 2011, dozens of Armenians who had been raised Muslim participated in a baptism ceremony at the restored Church. The names of those who participated in the baptism ceremony, conducted by Deputy Patriarch Archbishop Aram Ate\u015fyan, were not released publicly for security reasons. Turkish-Armenians who wish to convert must first file for a formal \"change of religion\" at court. They then go to the Church where they learn about the foundational teachings of the Christian faith. When it is decided that the applicant has understood these teachings, they are permitted to prepare for the baptism ceremony.\nIn May 2015, 12 Armenians from Tunceli were baptized. The twelve Armenians were baptized together in a collective ceremony after a six month education about Christian beliefs.\nIn 2009, the British MP Bob Spink tabled an early day motion entitled \"Independent Inquiry into The Armenian Genocide\" that stated that the House of Commons \"is concerned about the welfare of thousands of Crypto-Armenians in Turkey.\"\n\n\n== Number ==\nVarious scholars and authors have estimated the number of individuals of full or partial Armenian descent living in Turkey. The range of the estimates is great due to different criteria used. Most of these numbers do not make a distinction between hidden Armenians and Islamized Armenians. According to journalist Erhan Ba\u015fyurt the main difference between the two groups is their self-identity. Islamized Armenian, in his words, are \"children women who were saved by Muslim families and have continued their lives among them\", while hidden Armenians \"continued their hidden lives as Armenians.\"\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nMost Crypto-Armenians reside in eastern provinces of Turkey, where the pre-genocide Armenian population was concentrated.\n\n\n=== Tunceli ===\n\n\n==== Dersim Armenians ====\nThrough the 20th century, an unknown number of Armenians living in the mountainous region of Tunceli (Dersim) had converted to Alevism. During the Armenian Genocide, many of the Armenians in the region were saved by their Kurdish neighbors. According to Mihran Prgi\u00e7 G\u00fcltekin, the head of the Union of Dersim Armenians, around 75% of the population of Dersim are \"converted Armenians.\" He reported in 2012 that over 200 families in Tunceli have declared their Armenian descent, but others are afraid to do so. In April 2013, Aram Ate\u015fyan, the acting Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, stated that 90% of Tunceli's population is of Armenian origin.\n\n\n== Notable hidden Armenians ==\nFethiye \u00c7etin (b. 1950 in Maden, El\u00e2z\u0131\u011f Province), lawyer, writer and human rights activist\nAhmet Abakay (b. 1950 in Divri\u011fi), journalist\nYa\u015far Kurt (b. 1968), rock singer\nRuhi Su (1912-1985), musician\n\n\n== See also ==\nPassing (race)\nArmenians in Turkey\nHamshenis\nCrypto-Christianity\nCrypto-Jews\nCrypto-Paganism\nD\u00f6nmeh\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMelkonyan, Ruben (2008). \"The Problem of Islamized Armenians in Turkey\" (PDF).

As former party whip of the United Development Party (PPP) in the People's Representative Council, Saifuddin pulled the PPP closer to the political center. Also unlike Ali, Saifuddin has indicated a willingness as Religious Affairs Minister to extend recognition to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, a minority group in the country. Saifuddin also participated with Indonesian Buddhists in a joint prayer in Medan in November 2016. Conversely, he also urged Muslims in Indonesia to pray for the Rohingya minority in Myanmar in reaction to the 2016 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar, and stated that the Government of Indonesia was monitoring the situation.\nSaifuddin also cautioned against follow-up protests to the November 2016 Jakarta protests against the Christian governor of Jakarta accused of blasphemy, stating that formal charges had been brought to a court of law and that there was no justification for further protests.\n\n\n== References ==",

The temple faces west and the Sanctum is used for storage purposes. The sculptural embellishment on the outer wall and the parsavadevatas in raha niche suggests that the temple was originally dedicated to Vishnu.\n\n\n== The Temple ==\nThe temple is estimated to have built during the 12th century AD with Rekha deul topology.\nSurrounding: The Temple is surrounded by Bindusagara tank in the west at a distance of 8.00 metres across the road, Ananta Vasudeva Temple in the north at a distance of 10.00 metres, Ananta Vasudev bhogamandapa in the east at a distance of 1.00 metres and local shops in the south.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe talajangha is carved with a series of khakhara mundi pilasters and bandhana has three mouldings without any carvings. The upara jangha is carved with a series of pidhamundi. The baranda has five mouldings and Gandi is plain except udyota simha in the central raha and dopichha simha at the above the kanika paga.\nThe doorjambs are carved with three vertical bands of puspa sakha, nara sakha and lata sakha. At the base of the jambs there are two pidha mundi dvarapala niches that house unusual kind of doorkeepers of male and female figures. At the lalatabimba there is a Gajalaxmi panel sitting in lalitasana over a lotus pedestal. While her left hand is holding lotus the right hand is in varada mudra. The deity is flanked by two full blown lotuses. Inside the Sanctum, the eastern wall is carved with two large sized pidha mundi niches, which was originally enshrining the presiding deity, which is now missing.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLesser Known Monuments of Bhubaneswar by Dr. Sadasiba Pradhan (ISBN 81-7375-164-1)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of temples in Bhubaneswar\n\n\n== External links ==\nVishnu Temple - Bhubaneswar - Bada",

The first two are commonly used; the third is a stylistic alternative.\nSometimes the longa or breve is used to indicate a very long note of indefinite duration, as at the end of a piece (e.g. at the end of Mozart's Mass KV 192).\nA single eighth note, or any faster note, is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups. When a stem is present, it can go either up (from the right side of the note head) or down (from the left side), except in the cases of the longa or maxima which are nearly always written with downward stems. In most cases, the stem goes down if the notehead is on the center line or above, and up otherwise. Any flags always go to the right of the stem.\n\n\n== Modifiers ==\nA note value may be augmented by adding a dot after it. This dot adds the next briefer note value, making it one and a half times its original duration. A number of dots (n) lengthen the note value by 2n \u2212 1/2n its value, so two dots add two lower note values, making a total of one and three quarters times its original duration. The rare three dots make it one and seven eighths the duration, and so on.\nThe double dot was first used in 1752 by J.J. Quantz; in music of the 18th century and earlier the amount by which the dot augmented the note varied: it could be more or less than the modern interpretation, to fit into the context.\nTo divide a note value to three equal parts, or some other value than two, tuplets may be used. However, see swung note and notes in\u00e9gales.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Gregorian chant ===\nAlthough note heads of various shapes, and notes with and without stems appear in early Gregorian chant manuscripts, many scholars agree that these symbols do not indicate different durations, although the dot is used for augmentation. See neume.\nIn the 13th century, chant was sometimes performed according to rhythmic modes, roughly equivalent to meters; however, the note shapes still did not indicate duration in the same way as modern note values.\n\n\n=== Mensural notation ===\nAround 1250, Franco of Cologne invented different symbols for different durations, although the relation between different note values could vary; three was the most common ratio. Philippe de Vitry's treatise Ars nova (1320) described a system in which the ratios of different note values could be 2:1 or 3:1, with a system of mensural time signatures to distinguish between them.\nThis black mensural notation gave way to white mensural notation around 1450, in which all note values were written with white (outline) noteheads. In white notation the use of triplets was indicated by coloration, i.e. filling in the noteheads to make them black (or sometimes red). Both black and white notation periodically made use of ligatures, a holdover from the clivis and porrectus neumes used in chant.\nAround 1600 the modern notational system was generally adopted, along with barlines and the practice of writing multipart music in scores rather than only individual parts. In the 17th century, however, old usages came up occasionally.\n\n\n== Origins of the names ==\nThe British names go back at least to English renaissance music, and the terms of Latin origin had international currency at that time. Obviously, longa means 'long', and the rest rarely indicate relative shortness. Breve is from Latin brevis, 'short', minim is from minimus, 'very small', and quaver refers to the quavering effect of very fast notes. The elements semi-, demi- and hemi- mean 'half' in Latin, French and Greek respectively. The chain semantic shift whereby notes which were originally perceived as short came progressively to be long notes is interesting both linguistically and musically. However, the crotchet is named after the shape of the note, from the Old French for a 'little hook', and it is possible to argue that the same is true of the minim, since the word is also used in palaeography to mean a vertical stroke in mediaeval handwriting.\n\n\n== References ==",

Daughter of the Bulgarian tsar Ivan Sratsimir, Dorothea was held hostage by King Louis I of Hungary, who married her off to Ban Tvrtko I of Bosnia in 1374. She became queen in 1377 and may have been the mother of King Tvrtko II.\n\n\n== Captivity ==\nDorothea was the daughter of Ivan Sratsimir, Tsar of Bulgaria. Her mother was Ivan Sratsimir's first cousin and second wife, Anna of Wallachia. Dorothea was captured along with her parents and sister in 1365 by the army of King Louis I of Hungary following his conquest of Ivan Sratsimir's capital city, Vidin. The family was held captive in Humnik Fortress in Bosiljevo, Croatia. They spent four years in the fortress, and were forced to convert from Bulgarian Orthodoxy to Roman Catholicism.\nIvan Sratsimir was released and restored as Louis's vassal in 1369, but Louis retained Dorothea and her sister at the Hungarian court as honored hostages to ensure their father's loyalty. Dorothea was placed in care of the queen, Elizabeth of Bosnia, and queen mother, Elizabeth of Poland. According to Mavro Orbini, Dorothea was a lady-in-waiting to the Hungarian queen. While her sister died in childhood, Dorothea fell in favour of the King.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nBan Tvrtko I of Bosnia, another vassal of King Louis, probably first heard about Dorothea during her captivity in Croatia. Louis eventually suggested that Tvrtko marry her. The negotiations were carried out by Louis on Dorothea's behalf. The marriage that made Dorothea Banness of Bosnia was celebrated in Hungarian-held Syrmia in early December 1374, either in \u0110akovo or in Ilinci; the wedding festivities doubtlessly took place in Ilinci.\nIn October 1377, Tvrtko was crowned King of Bosnia and Dorothea became the country's first queen. As such, Dorothea was consulted in state affairs. She witnessed her husband's charters and took oaths to respect them, initially alongside her mother-in-law, Jelena \u0160ubi\u0107. Queen Dorothea is mentioned in a 1382 charter to the Republic of Ragusa alongside the King and the King's son, presumably her son too. This child may have been the future King Tvrtko II.\nQueen Dorothea died shortly before 1390, when her husband was negotiating a remarriage into the House of Habsburg.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAn\u010di\u0107, Mladen (1997).

            "content": "Forbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey, which was in front of the Abbey Church. The site was formerly known as the Forbury, and one of the roads flanking the current gardens is still known as The Forbury. Fairs were held on the site three times a year until the 19th century.\nForbury, a suburb of the New Zealand city of Dunedin, was named after the gardens by early resident William Henry Valpy, who was born in Reading.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nReading Abbey was founded in 1121, by Henry I, and for the next four centuries it dominated the town, becoming one of the most influential establishments in England. Like other such monasteries, Reading had a forbury, or 'borough in front', an area of open land which provided a meeting place between the Abbey and the town. The Forbury in Reading was part of the outer court of the Abbey, and provided a market place as well as a meeting place.\nIn 1150, what is now Forbury Hill was constructed to help fortify the Abbey during the civil war between King Henry I's daughter, Matilda, and his nephew, Stephen.\nThe abbey was largely destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Cook Faringdon, was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church. After this, the buildings of the abbey were extensively robbed, with lead, glass and facing stones removed for reuse elsewhere, and the focus of the town moved away from the Forbury.\nReading suffered badly during the English Civil War, being occupied at different time by both sides. During the Siege of Reading (1642-3), the Royalist garrison built defences that further damaged the remains of the Abbey, and Forbury Hill was used as a gun emplacement.\nAs a result of the concerns sparked in England by the French Revolution, and throughout the ensuing Napoleonic Wars, the Forbury was used for military drills and parades, in addition to its well-established use for fairs and circuses. Three annual fairs were generally held on the Forbury, but the most significant was the Michaelmas Fair, held in September. This fair became known as the Reading Cheese Fair, although cattle, horses and hops were also sold, and it served as the principal local hiring fair.\nBy the first years of the 19th century, the western part of the Forbury was in use as a playground or sports ground for Reading School, which at this time was housed in the former Hospitium of St John. However the whole of the Forbury was in private ownership, and disputes were common as to the common rights of the town and the rights of the school.\nIn 1854, Forbury Hill and the eastern section of the present gardens were sold to Reading Corporation at the cost of \u00a31200, of which \u00a3400 was donated by the previous owner, a Mr Wheble. The resulting gardens were planned with a 'botanical character', a fountain and a summer house, and became known as the Pleasure Gardens. Work started in 1855 and the Pleasure Gardens opened on Easter Sunday 1856. A tunnel was built on the eastern side in 1859 to link the gardens and the Abbey ruins.\nThe success of the Pleasure Gardens contrasted with the situation in the western part of the Forbury, which was still used for fairs. After one fair, the area was described as being covered 'with heaps of oyster shells, manure and other refuse'. In 1860, this section of the Forbury was purchased by the town for \u00a36010 from Colonel Blagrave. It was decided that fairs should no longer be held there, but the emphasis remained on recreational use rather than botanical display, with the area grassed except for the outside walks and a gravelled parade ground.\nThe common ownership notwithstanding, the two halves of the Forbury remained very different in character, and separated by a wall. However in 1869 the town purchased 12 acres (4.9 ha) of King's Meadow, the abbey's former water meadow by the River Thames, as a recreation ground. This paved the way for the incorporation, in 1873, of the western part of the Forbury into the gardens, which then became known as Forbury Gardens.\nThe Maiwand Lion statue was erected in 1886 to commemorate the loss of 286 soldiers (though the exact number varies by account) from the 66th Royal Berkshire Regiment at the Battle of Maiwand in Afghanistan on the 27 July 1880. The sculptor of this 31-foot statue was George Blackall Simonds and was unveiled in December 1886. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion.\nA cross memorializing Henry I was put up, at about the same time as the Maiwand Lion, on the north-west corner of the footings of the Abbey Church. The Victoria Gates on the southern side of the gardens commemorate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. The shields on the gates are those of the Borough and the Abbey.\nIn 2015, a statue was unveiled to the memory of Trooper Fred Potts VC, who was awarded the Victoria Cross in October 1915, after endangering his own life to drag a wounded comrade from the battlefield at the Battle of Scimitar Hill. The statue is located just outside the garden wall, facing the Crown Court building. In the same year, the Reading International Brigade Memorial was relocated from the Civic Centre to a location on the east side of the gardens, and rededicated.\n\n\n== The gardens today ==\n\nA grand re-opening event took place on May 14, 2005, to mark the completion of a one-year restoration project. The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded Reading Borough Council \u00a32.13 million to restore the historic features of the Forbury Gardens and improve safety and access for visitors. The scheme was developed in consultation with residents and interested local groups.\nWork in the gardens themselves has included the restoration of the Maiwand Lion, the bandstand, water feature and the garden's walls, fencing and gateways. A new Keeper's Lodge also includes a refreshment kiosk, public toilets and facilities for a resident gardener. Reading Borough Council organises summer concerts in the bandstand on Sunday afternoons during July and August.\nAfter the restoration, closed-circuit cameras monitor the whole Gardens area, in a bid to deter the drug users and other miscreants that used to make ordinary people fearful of using the public gardens. The garden has received a Green Flag Award for being welcoming, safe, well maintained and involving the community.\nThe Forbury Hill is now accessible by two winding footpaths (wheelchair-accessible) that lead to an area that is elevated about 3 metres above the surrounding gardens. A single plane tree stands in the middle, and around the outer edge of the top of the hill are wooden seats.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo: History of Reading Abbey, BBC\nBerkshire History: Reading Abbey\nWorld War One Battle of Verdun oak and chestnut trees traced - Oak in Forbury Gardens BBC",

Sutton Athletic has been playing football at a county level in Kent since the 1960s, winning leagues and cups in the Kent County Football League system, particularly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, when they won three successive league-and-cup doubles.

Sutton were runners-up in the West Senior Division in 1975\u201376 and followed this up with another double in 1976\u201377, winning the league and the West Senior Division Challenge Cup. The team was relegated within the next few years but finished runners-up in the West Premier Division in 1982\u201383. However, the club were then relegated again and due to league restructuring ended up in West Division Two again, from which they were promoted after winning the league in 1993\u201394. After being relegated to the East Division Two they won the Les Leckie Cup in 2005\u201306 and were promoted again after finishing runners-up in the West Division Two a year later.

He is most noted as a commander of the 16th Armored Division during World War II.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nJohn Leonard Pierce was born on April 25, 1895 in Dallas, Texas as the son of lawyer, Frank Cushman Pierce and his wife, Isabella. Pierce attended the West Texas Military Academy in San Antonio, Texas and subsequently Texas A&M University and then joined the Army in June 1917. Subsequently served during World War I in France. After war, Pierce served with 8th Infantry Division within Occupation forces in Koblenz, Germany.\nAfter return to the United States, Pierce stayed in the Army and was interested in mobile warfare and the development of armor.\n\n\n== World War II ==\nAt the beginning of World War II, Pierce served as a Deputy Chief of Staff of the 3rd Armored Division under command of Major general Alvan C. Gillem. One year later, Pierce was transferred to the II Armored Corps (later redesignated as the XVIII Airborne Corps), where he served as Chief of Staff.\nIn June 1943, Pierce was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and was appointed a Chief of Staff of Armored Command. He stayed in this capacity until September 1944, when he was transferred to Camp Chaffee in Arkansas, where he assumed command of 16th Armored Division. He replaced major general Douglass T. Greene in this capacity.\nPierce arrived with his 16th Armored Division in Europe in February 1945 and participated in combats in Germany and Czechoslovakia. Pierce commanded the division during the liberation of Pilsen.\nFor his service during World War II, general Pierce was awarded with Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster by the government of the United States and with Order of the White Lion and with War Cross by the government of the Czechoslovakia for his merits during liberation of Western Bohemia.\n\n\n== Life after War ==\nPierce was subsequently transferred back to the United States, where he was appointed the President of the Secretary of War's Discharge Review Board. He served in this capacity until 1946, when he retired from the Army.\nBrigadier general John Leonard Pierce died at the age of 63 at his home in San Antonio, Texas and is buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery together with his wife, Kate Bodine Pierce (1895 - 1988).\n\n\n== Decorations ==\nHere is Brigadier general Pierce\u00b4s ribbon bar:\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "The term rumba may refer to a variety of unrelated music styles. Originally, \"rumba\" was used as a synonym for \"party\" in northern Cuba, and by the late 19th century it was used to denote the complex of secular music styles known as Cuban rumba. Since the early 20th century the term has been used in different countries to refer to distinct styles of music and dance, most of which are only tangentially related to the original Cuban rumba, if at all. The vague etymological origin of the term rumba, as well as its interchangeable use with guaracha in settings such as bufo theatre, is largely responsible for such worldwide polysemy of the term. In addition, \"rumba\" was the primary marketing term for Cuban music in North America, as well as West and Central Africa, during much of the 20th century, before the rise of mambo, pachanga and salsa.\n\"Rumba\" entered the English lexicon in the early 20th century, at least as early as 1919, and by 1932 it was used a verb to denote the ballroom dance, although the anglicised spelling \"rhumba\" became prevalent and is now recommended to distinguish it from traditional Cuban rumba. Also in the first third of the 20th century, \"rumba\" entered the Spanish flamenco world as a fast-paced palo (style) inspired in the Cuban guaracha, and which gave rise to other forms of urban music now known as \"rumba\". Throughout Latin America, \"rumba\" acquired different connotations, mostly referring to Cubanized, danceable, local styles, such as Colombian rumba criolla (creole rumba). At the same time, \"rumba\" began to be used a catch-all term for Afro-Cuban music in most African countries, later giving rise to re-Africanized Cuban-based styles such as Congolese rumba.\n\n\n== Rumba in Cuba ==\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, several secular dance-oriented music styles were developed by Afro-Cuban workers in the poor neighbourhoods of Havana and Matanzas. These syncretic styles would later be referred to as \"rumba\", a word that also meant \"party\". Traditionally, the three main styles of rumba are yamb\u00fa, columbia and guaguanc\u00f3, each of which has a characteristic dance, rhythm and singing. Although still a purely folkloric genre, numerous innovations have been introduced in rumba since the mid 20th century, including new styles such as bat\u00e1-rumba and guarapachangueo.\n\n\n== Rumba in North America ==\n\nIn the US, the term \"rhumba\" (anglicised version of rumba), began to be used during the 1920s to refer to ballroom music with Afro-Cuban music themes, particularly in the context of big band music. This music was mostly inspired by son cubano, while being rhythmically and instrumentally unrelated to Cuban rumba. By the 1930s, with the release of \"The Peanut Vendor\", the genre had become highly-successful and well-defined. The rhumba dance that developed on the East Coast of the United States was based on the bolero-son. The first rumba competition took place in the Savoy Ballroom in 1930. Nowadays, two different styles of ballroom rumba coexist: American-style and International-style.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the Mexican and American film industry expanded the use of the term rumba as rumbera films became popular. In this context, rumberas were Cuban and Mexican divas, singers and actresses who sang boleros and canciones, but rarely rumbas. Notable rumberas include Rita Montaner, Rosa Carmina, Mar\u00eda Antonieta Pons and Nin\u00f3n Sevilla.\nIn the 1970s, with the emergence of salsa as a popular music and dance genre in the US, rhythmic elements of Cuban rumba (particularly guaguanc\u00f3) became prevalent alongside the son. Like salsa, rhumba would then be danced to salsa ensembles instead of big bands. By the end of the 20th century, rhumba was also danced to pop music and jazz bands as seen in TV shows like Dancing with the Stars.\n\n\n== Rumba in Spain ==\n\nIn Spain, the term rumba was introduced in the early 20th century as rumba flamenca, one of the palos (styles) of flamenco. Particularly, it is considered one of the cantes de ida y vuelta, since flamenco itself might have had an influence on Cuban rumba, particularly on its vocal style. However, musicologists agree that rumba flamenca does not truly derive from Cuban rumba, but from guaracha, a fast-paced music style from Havana. Apart from rumba flamenca, other syncretic styles of Afro-Cuban origin have been named \"rumba\" throughout the Iberian peninsula, outside of the context of flamenco (where the term cantes the ida y vuelta is mostly restricted), such as the Galician rumba.\nIn the late 1950s, popular artists such as Peret (El Rey de la Rumba) and El Pesca\u00edlla developed an uptempo style that combined elements from rumba flamenca, Spanish gypsy music and pop. This became known as Catalan rumba (rumba catalana). In the 1980s, the style gained international popularity thanks to French ensemble Gipsy Kings.\nIn the 1990s, the term \u201ctecno-rumba\u201d was used to describe the music of Camela, and later Az\u00facar Moreno. Since the early 2000s, the term rumba has been used in Spain to refer to derivatives of Catalan rumba with hip hop and rock elements, as recorded by Estopa, Huecco and Melendi.\n\n\n== Rumba in Colombia ==\nIn the late 1930s and early 1940s, a fusion of bambuco and Afro-Cuban music was developed in Colombia by artists such as Emilio Sierra, Milciades Garavito, and Di\u00f3genes Chaves Pinz\u00f3n, under the name rumba criolla (creole rumba). Rumba criolla is classified into different regional styles such as rumba antioque\u00f1a and rumba tolimense.\n\n\n== Rumba in Africa ==\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, Afro-Cuban son groups such as Septeto Habanero, Trio Matamoros and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were played over Radio Congo Belge in L\u00e9opoldville (Kinshasa), gaining widespread popularity in the country during the following decades. Once local bands tried to emulate the sound of Cuban son (incorrectly referred to as \"rumba\" in Africa, despite being unrelated to Cuban rumba), their music became known as Congolese rumba or rumba Lingala. By the late 1960s, Congolese rumba was an established genre in most of Central Africa, and it would also impact the music of West and East Africa. Franco's OK Jazz and Le Grand Kall\u00e9's African Jazz were amongst the most successful Congolese rumba ensembles of the 20th century. A faster subgenre known as soukous (from the French word secouer, \"to shake\") was developed in the late 1960s by bands such as African Fiesta and is often used as a synonym of the former.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was also a specialist in karate and judo, and was founder and president of the International Karate League in Japan.\n\n\n== Career ==\nNarikawa started his acting career in 1968. He appeared in numerous television shows with his role as Jouji Gamou, the alter-ego of \"Spectreman\" being his most noted. The 64 episode series was shown in the U.S. on UHF during the 1970s and 1980s.\nGrand Master Narikawa was the President and Founder of the Gensei-Ryu Seidokai International Karate Federation (Seidokai) with Headquarters in Tokyo Japan. Seidokai celebrated its 25th year anniversary in April 2004.\nIn the summer of 2009 (while under treatment for lung cancer) Grand Master Narikawa subdued an arsonist who was assaulting a Tokyo metropolitan police officer at the scene of the arson. Grand Master Narikawa immobilizeded the arsonist while the injured police officer regained his footing to make the arrest. When back-up arrived, the police officer was immediately hospitalized for severe facial injuries. The arsonist was a large individual 35 years younger than Grand Master Narikawa.\nThe philosophical foundation of Grand Master Narikawa's traditional Karate teachings has survived and are characterized by a moral code of behavior, both in and out of the D\u014dj\u014d. The essence of this code of behavior is captured in the Japanese term \u201creigi.\u201d Translated into English this word carries the meaning of the concepts of Courtesy, Manners, and Respect. Students of Karate are to learn to use their bodies as weapons; it is imperative for the students (and Instructors) to understand the tremendous responsibility that comes with such knowledge. There is a moral imperative to use this knowledge correctly and responsibly for their own development and for the moral development of the people with whom they come into contact with.\n\n\n== Death ==\nNarikawa died in Tokyo, Japan at the age of 65 from lung cancer.\n\n\n== References ==",

Hamburg could combine the water based and the other non-water based games in a very small circle, due to its good location. Hamburg would host the games the first time and would therefore be preferred to Berlin.\nOn 16 March 2015, the National Olympic Committee (DOSB) proposed Hamburg to be the candidate city from Germany. On 21 March 2015, the DOSB's general assembly confirmed the decision to allow Hamburg to bid for the games.\nFor its 2024 bid, Hamburg re-used the logo and the slogan of an earlier bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The logo showed a wave of water turning into a flame, referring to the water that is a defining aspect of Hamburg's cityscape and the Olympic flame. The slogan was \"Feuer und Flamme\", or \"Fire and Flame\", combining the Olympic flame with a German expression translating to \"to be fire and flame for something\", meaning to be very enthusiastic and/or excited about something. (West) Germany last hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich and also had recent experience with the success of the 1974 and 2006 World Cups, where Hamburg was one of the host cities.\nOn 13 April 2015, it was announced that Kiel would be Hamburg's venue for all sailing competitions.\n\n\n== 2015 referendum ==\n\nOn 29 November 2015, a referendum was held in which 51.6% of the citizens voted against a bid for the Olympics.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nParis will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n== References ==",

            "content": "Kent Island is the largest island in the Chesapeake Bay, and a historic place in Maryland. To the east, a narrow channel known as the Kent Narrows barely separates the island from the Delmarva Peninsula, and on the other side, the island is separated from Sandy Point, an area near Annapolis, by roughly four miles (6.4 km) of water. At only four miles wide, the main waterway of the bay is at its narrowest at this point and is spanned here by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. The Chester River runs to the north of the island and empties into the Chesapeake Bay at Kent Island's Love Point. To the south of the island lies Eastern Bay. The United States Census Bureau reports that the island has 31.62 square miles (81.90 km2) of land area.\nKent Island is part of Queen Anne's County, Maryland, and Maryland's Eastern Shore region. The first English establishment on the island, Kent Fort, was founded in 1631, making Kent Island the oldest English settlement within the present day state of Maryland and the third oldest permanent English settlement in what became the United States \u2014 after Jamestown, Virginia (1607) and Plymouth, Massachusetts (1620). The census-designated places of Stevensville, and Chester are located on the island, along with several other communities, including the fishing community of Kent Narrows, which is located partially on the island. Although all of Kent Island's communities are unincorporated, the census designated places of Stevensville and Chester on the island are both more populous than any of Queen Anne's County's incorporated towns.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early and Colonial ===\nPrior to European colonization, Kent Island was inhabited by Native Americans for nearly 12,000 years. The island was inhabited by the Matapeake tribe, members of the Algonquian nation who the Matapeake, area of Kent Island is named after. Other tribes that inhabited the area and often visited the island included the Ozinie and Monoponson tribes, the latter of which share their name with the Algonquian name for the island, Monoponson. During the 16th and 17th centuries, early explorers of the Chesapeake Bay, including Captain John Smith, were the first Europeans to see Kent Island; however, it wasn't until August 1631 that the island became an English settlement. At that time, William Claiborne, a resident of Jamestown, founded a settlement near the southern end of the island for the purpose of trading with Native Americans and named the island after his birthplace of Kent, England. The settlement burned down in the winter of 1631\u201332 but was quickly rebuilt, and in 1634 the settlement included a gristmill, courthouse, and trading station. Following the formation of the province of Maryland, Claiborne continued to recognize the island as part of his home colony of Virginia, while Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore recognized it as part of Maryland. Claiborne was forced from and returned to the island twice before leaving permanently in 1658, thus effectively ending the disputes. Virginia's official claims to the island, however, continued until 1776.\n\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\nUntil the early 19th century, Kent Island was used almost entirely for farming of tobacco and corn, however that ended due to the depletion of nutrient-rich soil as a result of the lack of crop rotation and poor farming practices. The island's economy went into decline while the soil recovered, with the exception of the port town of Broad Creek. This began to change around the time of the Industrial Revolution. In 1850, the town of Stevensville, was founded after the sale of farms owned by James and Charles Stevens and prospered as a major hub for steamboat travel across the Chesapeake Bay. Stevensville was also the home of a railroad station known as the Stevensville Train Depot that was located near the western end of a railroad that carried ferry passengers to other parts of the Eastern Shore. Also during this time, small resorts on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean were established in the area. Such a resort existed at Love Point, to the north of Stevensville. Farming returned to the economy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries with farmers growing crops including corn, wheat, berries, and melons. Many of the island's inhabitants worked as watermen in the expanding seafood industry capitalizing on the Chesapeake's supply of Maryland Blue Crab, rockfish, and oysters.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nAs roads replaced railroads and steamboats into the twentieth century, there was a growing need for a road bridge connecting the two shores of the Chesapeake Bay. In 1952 the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was completed, connecting the island directly to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. The bridge completely replaced the steamboat system and also led to further growth of Kent Island and the rest of the Eastern Shore. In 1973, in order to accommodate growing traffic across the bay, the bridge was expanded with an additional span built next to the existing one. Then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s U.S. Route 50 was converted to a freeway across the island.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn September 2003, Kent Island was one of the many places in the Chesapeake Bay Area affected by Hurricane Isabel. Local businesses and historic local landmarks were either damaged or destroyed in the storm and the storm surge caused by it. Much of the damage from the hurricane, mostly caused by flooding, took several months to repair.\nToday, Kent Island is considered a suburb of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and was home to 16,812 residents at the time of the 2000 U.S. Census. The combined area of the Stevensville and Chester CDPs had 9,603 residents. Many have relocated from the Washington, D.C. or Baltimore metro areas and continue to commute back there. Stevensville and Chester are also among the most densely populated areas of the Eastern Shore, and the most densely populated in Queen Anne's County, making up 23.67% of its population and only 3.07% of its land area.\n\n\n=== Historic places ===\n\nAs of 2006, many of the island's historic places have been preserved and are highlighted by the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway and the American Discovery Trail, both of which pass through the island. Several buildings on the island that are still left over from the 19th century and earlier include the Cray House, a rare remaining example of post and plank construction, the old Stevensville post office (left, yellow building in center), Christ Episcopal Church, and the Stevensville Train Depot (right). Stevensville's historic district along with some of the buildings in the town are on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nListed are notable people who have lived on Kent Island.\nBrock Adams \u2013 United States Secretary of Transportation and United States Senator from Washington\nElbert N. Carvel \u2013 Governor of Delaware\nWilliam Claiborne \u2013 Founder of Kent Island\nJames Earickson \u2013 former State Treasurer of Missouri\nHenry R. Gibson \u2013 U.S. representative from Tennessee\nTheodore N. Lerner \u2013 Principal owner of the Washington Nationals\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Roads ===\nThe main mode of transportation on Kent Island, as with most other suburban areas of the United States, is the automobile. Kent Island's main roads include the U.S. Route 50/U.S. Route 301 freeway, which connects the island to Central Maryland via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and to the Delmarva Peninsula via the Kent Narrows Bridge. The island is also served by Maryland Routes 8, 18, and 552.\n\n\n=== Trails ===\nThe original section of the Cross Island Trail, a walking and biking trail on Kent Island, was built in the late 1990s, as part of Queen Anne's County's portion of the American Discovery Trail. The full trail was completed in 2001.\nBy the time the Cross Island Trail was completed, growing concern over the safety of pedestrians using the shoulder of Route 8 prompted the construction of a new trail paralleling the road. When completed, the trail, known as the Kent Island South Trail, will run from Romancoke Pier at the southern end of Route 8, heading north and crossing the road in Matapeake, near Matapeake Elementary and Middle schools. From there it will pass through Mobray Park, then over US 50, through Stevensville to end at the Cross Island Trail in or near Old Love Point Park.\nBoth the Cross Island and Kent Island South Trails are part of a planned trail system for Queen Anne's County; the entire Cross Island Trail and the existing section of the Kent Island South Trail represent the only completed portions of the system.\n\n\n=== Connections to the mainland ===\n\nThe bridges that currently connect Kent Island to the mainland, or once did, are as follows:\nThe Chesapeake Bay Bridge, or Bay Bridge, spans the Chesapeake Bay and carries US 50/301 to Annapolis.\nThe Kent Narrows Bridge spans the Kent Narrows and carries US 50/301 to the Delmarva Peninsula.\nThe Old Kent Narrows Bridge, Kent Narrows Drawbridge, or Route 18 Kent Narrows Bridge is a drawbridge that carries Maryland 18 into Grasonville. It was the predecessor to the current Kent Narrows Bridge and now serves local traffic.\nAn even older automobile bridge once ran across the Kent Narrows and was replaced by the current Route 18 Kent Narrows Bridge. Also in the past, railroad bridges over the Kent Narrows connected the Kent Island portion of the Queen Anne's County Railroad to the mainland.\nAccess to Annapolis and Washington, D.C. is available via MTA Commuter Bus Service Route 950. Weekday service to the mainland begins at 4:50 am and the last bus to leave Washington departs at 8:58 pm.\nLocal airports on the island serve as another type of connection to the mainland. The largest is the Bay Bridge Airport, located near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. Before the construction of the Bay Bridge, ferry services connected the island directly to Baltimore, Annapolis, and the small peninsula on which St. Michaels, is located. Some of the piers that were used as part of the ferry service are still used for fishing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of islands in Maryland\nKent Island High School\nThe Kent Island Bay Times\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\n=== General information ===\nLive Video Rt 50 / Rt 8 Bridge\nLive Video Rt 50 Kent Narrows\nInformation from the Maryland Online Encyclopedia\nKent Island Online Kent Island Online \u2013 A guide to Kent Island aimed at both locals and tourists\nCross Island Trail\nKent Island Annual Festival Island Bay Day\n\n\n=== History ===\nHistoric Sites in Queen Anne's County (Includes Kent Island)\nHistoric Sites in Stevensville\nMaps showing early settlements on the island",

            "content": "Green Shadows, White Whale is a 1992 novel by Ray Bradbury. It gives a fictionalized account of his journey to Ireland in 1953-1954 to write a screen adaptation of the novel Moby-Dick with director John Huston. Bradbury has said he wrote it after reading actress Katharine Hepburn's account of filming The African Queen with Huston in Africa. The title itself is a play on Peter Viertel's novel White Hunter, Black Heart, which is also about Huston.\nBradbury considers Green Shadows to be the culmination of thirty-five years of short stories, poems, and plays that were inspired by his stay in Ireland. As with most of his previous short-story collections, including The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chronicles, many of the short stories were originally published elsewhere and modified slightly for publication in the novel.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe narrator, an unnamed writer, is sent to Dublin, Ireland to coproduce a film adaptation of Moby Dick with a director whose first name is given as \"John\". While there, he hears of the many strange and surreal stories of the boyos in Finn's pub that make up the bulk of the novel, along with other adventures in the land of Ireland, including a \"hunt wedding\" and a house that has a mind of its own. The last chapter of the novel is devoted to the successful completion of the screenplay and the narrator's resulting ascent to fame.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe narrator arrives in Ireland by ferry. In his conversation with the customs inspector, his identity as a screenplay writer working on Moby Dick is introduced. They also discuss the peculiarities of the Irish. The narrator checks in at the Royal Hibernian Hotel in Dublin before leaving in a taxi for Kilcock. The taxi breaks down, and, after some resistance on his part, the narrator rides off on a bicycle given to him by the taxi driver. The narrator meets another bicyclist who tells him more of Ireland and its people. They proceed to Heeber Finn's pub, where the bicyclist is greeted as Mike, and the rest of the pub patrons are introduced.\nAn injured man stumbles into the pub and informs those inside of a collision on the road. The collision turns out to be that of two bicyclists. The narrator learns that these are common as bicyclists travel at high speeds through the fog. One of the victims is taken to a local clinic in the only car present, and the narrator rides off on the wrong side of the road, as advised. The narrator meets with his director, John. They sit down to dinner with John's wife, Ricki, and John tells a story about his and his wife's trip to Spain, calling Ricki a coward, which upsets her. The narrator then flashes back to when he was buying his travel copy of Moby Dick. A woman warned him not to go to Ireland because the director is a monster.\nThe narrator works for weeks on what he refers to as \"the Whale\" through the rain in Ireland. One night, Finn takes the narrator and Mike on a wild drive to bet on dog races. The narrator returns to his hotel and bed. The narrator buys a hunting outfit at Tyson's and goes to show it to John. John \"hypnotizes\" the narrator, who he calls H.G. for H.G. Wells, and the narrator says he wants to write \"the... finest screenplay in the history of the world.\"\nJohn's friend Tom calls from New York City, and John asks him and his fianc\u00e9e, Lisa, to come to Ireland and have a \"hunt wedding.\" Tom and Lisa disembark from the plane fighting, which amuses John. More is told about Tom and John, and the planning of the hunt wedding is begun. They finally find a reverend that will marry the two non-Catholics, Reverend Hicks, a Unitarian. The minister finds that the couple fights a lot, and they go to meet with him about it and fight the whole time. He says it is not a marriage but a \"rematch,\" and the narrator convinces him to marry the two anyway. John falls off a horse while interviewing actors for the film and is considerably injured. On hunter's wife is heard to have died from falling off her horse, which causes the wedding to be delayed and considerably affects Tom. John arrives back in Ireland on crutches. He tells of his fall and goes home to Ricki, who finally finds out about his injuries. Tom, Lisa, John, and the narrator go out to dinner, where John tells Tom and Lisa that the screaming of the chef in the kitchen while the doors swing open sounds like Tom their fighting, which surprises them. Mike and the narrator go to pick up the minister, and Mike talks about Ireland during the trip. The day of the hunt wedding follows, and Lisa has a bad cold. The minister, after waiting for Ricki to get a Bible, enters a long sermon about sin. The cake is served and found to be rock hard after the week of delay. Tom then asks the minister about the legitimacy of the marriage, who then pronounces them man and wife. Tom rides off to the hunt, but John is detained by his injuries. Lisa then asks the minister about the legality of the marriage, and he gives her papers to sign. The narrator awakes back at his hotel and Ricki calls. She tells him of the proceedings after the wedding, and Tom is nowhere to be found.\nJohn gives Ricki a horse as a Christmas present. She rides off but falls, and John orders her back onto the horse. The narrator works on his novel and then decides to go to Finn's. Finn tells a story of the fathers of the men in the pub. They go to burn down the house of Lord Kilgotten, who instead invites them in. They decide to wait until the next night to burn the house. Lord Kilgotten then takes them through his house, showing them all of his paintings, and they all volunteer to save the paintings between them before the fire. Later, however, they all return with the paintings after meeting different problems in taking possession of the works of art. Lord Kilgotten has them put all of the paintings back in his house, with the exception of a portrait of him by Lady Kilgotten which he told them not to save in the first place.\nThe narrator talks to John about how he can't help but give to the beggars outside and had been afraid to go out. John tries to give him advice and leads the way, but the narrator breaks down and gives to the beggars. They then proceed to O'Connell Bridge, where there is a beggar that the narrator thinks is blind, and who makes him both angry and compassionate. He is the only man without a cap and plays his concertina and sings beautifully. John is about to give him money, but the narrator stops him. The narrator then goes to buy the man a cap, deciding it's not just a ruse to evoke sympathy. He returns to find only a man and a woman on the bridge making horrible noise with a piano box on the bridge. John narrator find out from the paper that the man jumped off the bridge. John talks about the beggars and why they are in the position to beg, and the narrator goes out and gives the cap and all of the money he has with him to the first beggars that he sees.\nThe narrator briefly speaks with Finn about figuring out the Irish. Nora, a friend of the narrator, calls, and invites him to her place, which is called Grynwood. Once there, she explains to him that the house burned down four years before. She had rebuilt an exact copy, but found that nothing was the same. When she invited all of the guests for the first party, the atmosphere was very empty and quiet, and all of the guests left. She tells him that she and her friends were old evil, and with the house new and innocent, it didn't want them there anymore. She offers the house to the narrator, but he also finds that the house gives subtle hints that it doesn't want him there. They go back to Dublin together, and the narrator finds her gone in the morning.\nThe narrator returns to Finn's and talks with him shortly, primarily about John and the many people that have taken riding lessons and ended up injured. The narrator tells John that he won't be taking any more riding lessons. News comes to the pub that Lord Kilgotten has died. Everyone wonders what will become of his extensive wine collection, and this is answered at his funeral. In the wake come his coffin, made out of wine crates, and a lawyer, who reads Lord Kilgotten's will. In it he states that the residents of the town would not appreciate the value of the wine, and that he wants to have it all poured into the grave before he is buried. The men from the pub could not let all of the wine be wasted, and, after Finn's suggestion, they decide to drink the wine and relieve themselves in the grave, fulfilling the codicil of Kilgotten.\nFinn tells of the AMA's (American Medical Association) visit to Dublin. After finding and reporting endless problems in Dublin's facilities, the Irish threw them out. Finn tells the narrator to use the back door to his pub rather than the front on any bad days. He says that thinking only brings problems, and that it's better to drink and enjoy being alive. He also recommends a good pub in Dublin called \"The Four Provinces.\" The narrator goes to The Four Provinces on the extremely dull day of Sunday. He meets a man that tells him that thanking others for things makes life much better. The narrator leaves the pub and comes across a woman playing her harp. He thanks her and tells her what an effect she had on his day. However, he finds that he almost thanked her too much, to the point where she stops playing for a while.\nThe narrator calls for Mike to come pick him up and take him to Finn's. While he drives very gently, Mike says that he has decided to give up what the narrator believes is smoking for Lent. The next day Mike returns to pick up the narrator, this time driving wildly, and the narrator realizes that Mike gave up drinking, not smoking, and that the crazy drive was the first time he rode with Mike while he was sober. The narrator tells Mike that he should find something else to give up, Mike has a drink, and then they slowly drive back to Dublin.\nWhile going into the Royal Hibernian, the narrator meets a beggar and her child. He is shocked to find that they are the same ones he saw many years ago in a previous trip to Dublin, and asks the doorman about them. Nick, the doorman, says that they have been there for many years. The vision of the two plagues the narrator, and he wanders around Dublin looking for them. He finally runs into the woman around a corner, and she takes off running. He loses them and decides to go into The Four Provinces, where he finds them. He talks with the babe, who he learns is forty years old and called Brat, and the \"mother\" is his sister. They have been begging in front of the Hibernian for thirty years, and the rest of their family before that. Brat has no explanation for his small size, and says that they will soon have enough to sail to New York and no longer have to beg.\nThe narrator receives a cable that he had won an award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters of $5,000. He shares it with Ricki, John, and Jake Vickers. John insists that he find a way to spend it and earn more rather than let it rot. Then John brings up homosexuality, but unlike John and Jake the narrator has nothing to share on the topic. The subject returns to the prize money, and the narrator continues to refuse to go spend the money, and the two other men call him a coward. This takes a way the meaning from the prize and the money, and the narrator announces that he will bet all of the money at a horse race. Ricki had been quietly encouraging him through all of this, and they go out to the porch, where she reads him the letter again and the meaning returns. Nothing more is said of the prize or the money.\nThe narrator has a nightmare where John comes to his door in a wetsuit and says he will teach him to snorkel. The narrator goes after John tells him not to be yellow, and he drowns. Finn wakes the narrator, who was sleeping in the pub. He tells him a story of a visit that George Bernard Shaw made to the pub. He put up signs in the pub reading \"Stop,\" \"Consider,\" \"Think,\" and \"Do.\" This brought about silence in the pub for the first time in twenty years, and Father O'Malley has a conversation with Shaw about the philosophy of the words, and eventually has them all taken down. Shaw sees his mistake and breaks them all in his bag before leaving.\nJohn tells two reporters that he doesn't think the narrator's heart is really in the writing of the screenplay. As quite the opposite is true, the narrator is devastated, while John insists that it was only a joke. The narrator then goes and writes a short story. In this story, he goes to bring John the latest progress on the script. John reads each page and lets it fall, and at the end proclaims it good. They hear sounds outside, and John says it is a banshee, which appears an hour before someone's death. He then reads a review of the narrator's work, which turns out to be very bad. He throws it in the fire and says that it was actually a good review that he embellished a bit. They then discuss the sound of a banshee outside, and the narrator eventually goes out though John tries to stop him. He finds a woman that describes John but calls him Joe, and says that he is nobody's friend and does not really love. The narrator comes back in, and talks to John about the review, and then the banshee outside. John goes out though the narrator tries to stop him, and the narrator goes to bed. The narrator gives the story to John and tells him not to toss the pages as he reads. He then hears John mutter that there will be no more jokes.\nA very odd group arrives at the Royal Hibernian, led by a man named David Snell-Orkney, and come from Sicily. They become the talk of the town very quickly, and the pub patrons decide to surround the park in which the group is. After a half an hour, the group was still just sitting there watching the trees, and the few that actually stayed gave up on the watch. Timulty enters the pub declares that the Sicilians are very similar to the Irish, which the people in the pub are very opposed to at first but come to realize is true. Then the group comes in the pub, and says that they have been following summer around the globe and decided to stop by for some winter in Dublin. They had been looking at the leaves fall off the trees in the snow and ice. The Irishmen of the pub realize that they have not noticed the trees in decades, and they all go out to look at the leaves. Father Leary takes the group to his church, and later Finn convinces them to come see a \"sprint.\"\nThe Irish explain to the narrator and the Snell-Orkney group the anthem sprint. After a show in the cinema, the national anthem of Ireland is played. The moviegoers make a sport to see who can get out of the theater first after the movie before the anthem begins. Doone and Hoolihan decide to have an anthem run. All of the rules are explained, and after the movie, Hoolihan rushes out, but Doone does not. They find him still in the theater, where he was overcome by the singing of Deanna Durbin, which reminded him of his dead grandmother. They have the end of the film run again to redo the anthem sprint, but as the end approaches, Doone realizes that his leg is dead. He gives his cap and scarf to the narrator and tells him to run in his place. The narrator does so, but finds that he is the only one that ran. The rest are still in the theater, and then they wall watch again.\nSnell-Orkney and his friends all sail away singing. The narrator is at dinner, talking a lot with John, Jake, and friends. He makes jokes about everyone he can, evoking laughter from everyone present. He \"hypnotizes\" John, and tells him that it is not that the narrator that fears flying, but that John fears sailing. Later, John tells him that he needs to fly to England. The narrator says that he is scared to death and will not go, and John threatens to take both his vacation and that of their secretary. The narrator refuses and says that everyone will get their vacation, he will take the ferry, and John will fly. John leaves the room quickly, and refuses to talk to the narrator for a day and a half. Jake tells him that it is just a joke and that if he doesn't act upset about it that John will let it go.\nThe narrator awakes at seven, convinces himself that he is Herman Melville, and writes into the afternoon, finishing the script. He takes it to John, who is impressed, and says that he should take the ferry to England. The narrator tells the people in Finn's pub what he's found out about Ireland and says goodbye to them, and as he leaves, he sees the hills as green.\n\n\n== Literary significance and criticism ==\nGreen Shadows, White Whale received mixed reviews at its debut. Some critics gave the work high praise: Publishers Weekly said it was a \"lighthearted, beguiling autobiographical novel\", concluding, \"Bradbury's prose is as vibrant and distinctive as the landscape in which these delightful tales are set.\" Kirkus Reviews called it \"Bradbury's triumph. He has never written better.\"\nOthers found it to fall short because of its stilted diction and stereotypical characters and plots. The New York Times found it \"Somewhere between homage and hokum \u2026 a cartoon that might be offensive if it weren't so affectionate.\" The Los Angeles Times said it was \"a charming, delicate story\" of Bradbury's memories, and what they mean to him, \"and if at times the words seem hushed, muted in their reverence for history, the cast of characters \u2026 keeps the story from sliding headlong into wistfulness.\" David Soyka of the SF Site labeled the novel as a \"disappointment\" because of its clich\u00e9d plots and lack of coherency of the stories' themes. The Chicago Tribune criticized Bradbury's \"tin ear\" for dialogue, complaining that \"All of his Irish characters talk like Barry Fitzgerald reciting Se\u00e1n O'Casey to a busload of tourists from Tulsa.\"\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBrown, Charles N.; William G.

She speaks four languages fluently: English, Filipino, Spanish, and Portuguese. She lived in Brazil for six years while her grandmother was a diplomat for the Department of Foreign Affairs, and then her later years when her mother remarried a Brazilian citizen. Prior to her beauty pageant commitments, she was working as a technical assistant at a non-governmental organization, CSFI (Community and Family Relations International), which is engaged in the humanitarian response to the widespread devastation, as well as loss of life and livelihood.\n\n\n== Binibining Pilipinas 2014 ==\nGuidotti won the title Binibining Pilipinas International 2014 during the Binibining Pilipinas 2014 coronation night where she was also titled as Best in Long Gown. She was crowned by Binibining Pilipinas International 2013 and Miss International 2013, Bea Santiago.\nIn the question-and-answer round, Philippines' Department of Trade and Industry secretary Gregory Domingo asked, \"Should you win one of the titles, how would you use your crown to push for your advocacy?\" She answered:\n\nIf I win a title, I would use my crown to influence people to adopt their own advocacy. I want people to be passionate about it\u2014something that is really close to their heart. I will someday hopefully make an NGO of my own. So that is how I would promote my advocacy. Thank you.\n\n\n== Miss International 2014 ==\nGuidotti represented the Philippines in the Miss International 2014 pageant in Japan. She competed to succeed current Miss International 2013, compatriot Bea Santiago, but failed to place in the semifinals, ending the Philippines' six-year streak of consecutive placements in Miss International, from 2008 through 2013. The winner was Valerie Hernandez of Puerto Rico.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Bb.

            "content": "Stratford-upon-Avon () is a market town and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon District, in the county of Warwickshire, England, on the River Avon, 101 miles (163 km) north west of London, 22 miles (35 km) south east of Birmingham, and 8 miles (13 km) south west of Warwick. The estimated population in 2007 was 25,505, increasing to 27,445 at the 2011 Census.\nStratford was originally inhabited by Anglo-Saxons and remained a village before the lord of the manor, John of Coutances, set out plans to develop it into a town in 1196. In that same year, Stratford was granted a charter from King Richard I to hold a weekly market in the town, giving it its status as a market town. As a result, Stratford experienced an increase in trade and commerce as well as urban expansion.\nThe town is a popular tourist destination owing to its status as birthplace of English playwright and poet William Shakespeare, and receives approximately 2.5 million visitors a year. The Royal Shakespeare Company resides in Stratford's Royal Shakespeare Theatre.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin of name ===\nThe name is a combination of the Old English str\u01e3t (from Latin stratum), meaning 'street', ford, indicating a shallow part of a river or stream, allowing it to be crossed by walking or driving and avon which is the Celtic word for river. The 'street' was a Roman road which connected Icknield Street in Alcester to the Fosse Way. The ford, which has been used as a crossing since Roman times, later became the location of Clopton Bridge. A survey of 1251-52 uses the name Stratford for the first time to identify Old Stratford and the newer manors. The name was used after that time to describe the area specifically surrounding the Holy Trinity Church and the street of Old Town.\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe settlement which later became known as Stratford was first inhabited by Anglo-Saxons following their 7th century invasion of what would become known as Warwickshire. The land was owned by the church of Worcester and it remained a village until the late 12th century when it was developed into a town by lord of the manor, John of Coutances. John laid out a new town plan in 1196 based on a grid system to expand Stratford and allow people to rent property in order to trade within the town. Additionally, a charter was granted to Stratford by King Richard I in 1196 which allowed a weekly market to be held in the town, giving it its status as a market town. These two charters, which formed the foundations of Stratford's transformation from a village to a town, make the town of Stratford over 800 years old.\nJohn's plans to develop Stratford into a town meant Stratford became a place of work for tradesmen and merchants. By 1252 the town had approximately 240 burgages, as well as shops, stalls and other buildings. Stratford's new workers established a guild known as the Guild of the Holy Cross for their business and religious requirements.\n\nMany of the town's earliest and most important buildings are located along what is known as Stratford's Historic Spine, which was once the main route from the town centre to the parish church. The route of the Historic Spine begins at Shakespeare's Birthplace in Henley Street. It continues through Henley Street to the top end of Bridge Street and into High Street where many Elizabethan buildings are located, including Harvard House. The route carries on through Chapel Street where Nash's House and New Place are sited. The Historic Spine continues along Church Street where Guild buildings are located dating back to the 15th century, as well as 18th and 19th century properties. The route then finishes in Old Town, which includes Hall's Croft and the Holy Trinity Church.\n\nDuring Stratford's early expansion into a town, the only access across the River Avon into and out of the town was over a wooden bridge, thought to have been constructed in 1318. However, the bridge could not be crossed at times due to the river rising and was described by antiquarian John Leland as \"a poor bridge of timber and no causey [causeway] to it, whereby many poor folks and other refused to come to Stratford when Avon was up, or coming thither stood in jeopardy of life.\" In 1480, a new masonry arch bridge was built to replace it called Clopton Bridge, named after Hugh Clopton who paid for its construction. The new bridge made it easier for people to trade within Stratford and for passing travellers to stay in the town.\nThe Cotswolds, located close to Stratford, was a major sheep producing area up until the latter part of the 19th century, with Stratford one of its main centres for the processing, marketing, and distribution of sheep and wool. Consequently, Stratford also became a centre for tanning during the 15th\u201317th centuries. Both the river and the Roman road served as trade routes for the town.\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nDespite Stratford's increase in trade, it barely grew between the middle of the 13th century and the end of the 16th century, with a survey of the town showing 217 houses belonged to the lord of the manor in 1590. Growth continued to be slow throughout the 17th century, with hearth tax returns showing that at most there were approximately 429 houses in the town by 1670. However, more substantial expansion began following several enclosure acts in the late 18th century, with the first and largest new development by John Payton who developed land on the north side of the old town, creating several streets including John Street and Payton Street.\nBefore the dominance of road and rail, Stratford was the gateway to the network of British canals.\nIn 1769, the actor David Garrick staged a major Shakespeare Jubilee over three days which saw the construction of a large rotunda and the influx of many visitors. This contributed to the growing phenomenon of Bardolatry which made Stratford a tourist destination.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nStratford-upon-Avon is within the Stratford-on-Avon parliament constituency which has been represented by Nadhim Zahawi since 2010. Stratford is within the West Midlands Region constituency of the European Parliament which is represented by seven MEP's.\n\n\n=== Local government ===\nStratford is governed by three tiers of local government:\nWarwickshire County Council is a non-metropolitan county council, responsible for education, highways and other strategic matters.\nStratford-on-Avon District Council is responsible for housing, planning, rubbish collection and other local matters in Stratford and neighbouring towns and villages. The council is based at Elizabeth House, Church Street,\nStratford-upon-Avon Town Council is a parish council, responsible for crime prevention, cemeteries, public conveniences, litter, river moorings, parks, grants via the Town Trust and the selection of the town's mayor. The Town Council is based at the Town Hall in Sheep Street. The Stratford-upon-Avon Town Trust is based in the Civic Hall, Rother Street. The council serves the civil parish which includes several villages near the town, including Tiddington, Alveston and Shottery. The parish is split into nine wards - Avenue, Bishopton, Bridgetown, Clopton, Guildhall, Hathaway, Shottery, Tiddington and Welcombe, with two councillors representing each ward.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nStratford is 22 miles (35 km) south-east of Birmingham. It is close to the Cotswolds, with Chipping Campden 10 miles (16 km) to the south. Suburbs and areas of the town include Shottery, Bishopton, Bridgetown, Tiddington, and Old Town.\nStratford's location next to the River Avon means it is susceptible to flooding, including flash floods.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nStratford has a temperate maritime climate, as is usual for the British Isles, meaning extremes of heat and cold are rare. Sunshine hours are low to moderate, with an average of 1512.3 hours of sunshine annually. Rainfall is spread evenly throughout the year, with an annual average of 614.8 mm (24 in), with over 1 millimetre (0.039 inches) of rain recorded on 114.1 days per year according to the 1981-2010 observation period.\nStratford's warmest month is July, with an average maximum temperature of 22.8 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F) and January is the coldest month with an average high of 7.4 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F). The average summer maximum temperature is 22.7 \u00b0C (73 \u00b0F), with a winter average high of 7.5 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demography ==\nIn 2011, Stratford-upon-Avon had a population of 27,445 which was an increase from 25,505 in 2007. The town's population is set to increase over the next few years following government approval to build 800 new homes in Shottery, which also includes plans for a new relief road, up to 500 new homes planned in the Bishopton area of the town, and 270 homes on the Loxley Road.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nApart from tourism, which is a major employer, especially in the hotel, hospitality industry and catering sectors, other industries in the town include boat building and maintenance, bicycles, mechanical and electrical engineering, food manufacture, Information Technology, call centre and service sector activities, a large motor sales sector, industrial plant hire, building suppliers, market gardening, farming, storage and transport logistics, finance and insurance, and a large retail sector.\nMajor employers in the town include the NFU Mutual Insurance Company (and Avon Insurance), AMEC, Sitel, Tesco, Morrisons, Marks & Spencer, Debenhams, B & Q and Pashley Cycles. There are, nominally, three theatres run by the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, which attract large audiences and income for the town.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe regular large influx of tourists is the major source of the town's prosperity, receiving between 2.5 million and 3 million visitors annually. Stratford is a major English tourist town due to it being the birthplace of William Shakespeare, whom many consider the greatest playwright of all time. In 2010 the District Council spent \u00a3298,000 on tourism promotion and supports an official open-top tour bus service. In 2010 Stratford-on-Avon District Council launched a re-branded official tourism website for the Stratford area called Discover Stratford after opening a new tourist information centre on Henley Street in May 2010, which has since moved back to the original location on Bridgefoot.\n\n\n=== Shopping centres ===\nApart from the town centre, Maybird Shopping Park, usually referred to locally as \"The Maybird Centre\" or simply \"The Maybird\", is a large shopping centre situated on Birmingham Road, approximately a five-minute drive from the town centre, which features numerous shops and is a very well used part of the town. Shops featured at the Maybird include Asda Living, B&Q, Argos, Pizza Hut, WHSmith, Subway, The Big Fish, Game, Jollyes Pet Shop, Boots, M&S Foodhall, Sports Direct, New Look, Outfit, Poundstretcher, Pets at Home, Halfords, Matalan, Next and Costa Coffee, the latter of which is the second Costa Coffee shop in Stratford, with another located on Henley Street. A large Tesco supermarket is located next to the Maybird, behind B&Q. On the same road is a smaller Aldi store.\nDirectly opposite the Maybird, on the other side of Birmingham Road, is Maybrook Industrial Estate, a smaller shopping centre which includes stores such as Staples, Carphone Warehouse, Maplin Electronics and Carpetright.\nThe Rosebird Centre is a much smaller shopping centre located on Shipston Road and contains a large Waitrose supermarket, Pets Corner pet shop and Rosebird Centre Pharmacy. The pharmacy also serves as a medical centre, acting as a branch of the main Rother House Medical Centre on Alcester Road. An Avonvale Veterinary Centre is soon to open in Rosebird Centre.\nIn the town centre, Town Square, which is to revert to its old name, Bell Court, is undergoing extensive work and will fully reopen in 2017. Plans reveal there will be a new Everyman cinema in the Square, as well as a Byron Hamburgers restaurant. There are also plans for a full redevelopment of Bards Walk shopping arcade on Henley Street.\n\n\n=== Supermarkets ===\nThe town has a number of supermarkets, including Tesco on Birmingham Road, Aldi on Canners Way (just off Birmingham Road), Morrisons on Alcester Road, Marks & Spencer on Bridge Street (plus M&S Simply Food in Maybird Shopping Park, Birmingham Road) and Waitrose at The Rosebird Centre on Shipston Road. A small Sainsbury's store is located on Bridge Street.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\n\nThe first real theatre in Stratford was a temporary wooden affair built in 1769 by the actor David Garrick for his Shakespeare Jubilee celebrations of that year to mark Shakespeare's birthday. The theatre, built not far from the site of the present Royal Shakespeare Theatre, was almost washed away in two days of torrential rain that resulted in terrible flooding.\nTo celebrate the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth in 1864 the brewer, Charles Edward Flower, instigated the building of a temporary wooden theatre, known as the Tercentenary Theatre, which was built in a part of the brewer's large gardens on what is today the site of the new, and temporary, Courtyard Theatre. After three months the Tercentenary Theatre was dismantled, with the timber used for house-building purposes.\nIn the early 1870s, Charles Flower gave several acres of riverside land to the local council on the understanding that a permanent theatre be built in honour of Shakespeare's memory, and by 1879 the first Shakespeare Memorial Theatre had been completed. It proved to be a huge success, and by the early 20th century was effectively being run by the actor/manager Frank Benson, later Sir Frank Benson. The theatre burned down in 1926, with the then artistic director, William Bridges-Adams, moving all productions to the local cinema. An architectural competition was arranged to elicit designs for a new theatre, with the winner, English architect Elisabeth Scott, creating the Royal Shakespeare Theatre we see on the riverside today. The new theatre, adjoining what was left of the old theatre, was opened by the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, in 1932. The new theatre had many illustrious artistic directors, including the actor Anthony Quayle. Sir Peter Hall was appointed artistic director (designate) in 1959, and formed the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1961.\n\nThe RSC also runs two smaller theatres, the Swan Theatre, which was created in the 1980s out of the shell of the remains of the original Memorial Theatre and is modelled on an Elizabethan theatre, quickly becoming one of the finest acting spaces in the UK, and The Other Place theatre. Along with the RST, the Swan Theatre closed in 2007 for refurbishment and reopened in November 2010. The Other Place, a Black box theatre, was extended to become the temporary RSC Courtyard Theatre, opening in July 2006 and was the home of the RSC while the RST was being refurbished \u2013 its interior is similar to the interior of the refurbished RST. The Courtyard Theatre closed in 2015 and was replaced by The Other Place in March 2016, which returned as a 200-seat studio theatre within the steel extension in which the Courtyard Theatre was located.\nStratford is also home to The Bear Pit Theatre which was founded in 2008 as a voluntary organisation. It has 100 seats and is part of the Little Theatre Guild. The Attic Theatre, located next to the river, hosts productions from Tread the Board theatre company.\nThe Waterside Theatre (which is not part of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre complex) re-opened in December 2004, then closed again in September 2008. During this span, the theatre housed the Shakespearience visitor attraction. This has now been turned into the Clore Learning Centre, the Royal Shakespeare Company's education and events venue.\nIn 1986, Stratford-upon-Avon was the venue for the disastrous provincial try-out of the ill-fated musical Carrie, based on the Stephen King novel.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nStratford ArtsHouse, previously the Civic Hall, is home to Orchestra of the Swan, a professional chamber orchestra staging up to 10 orchestral concerts with international soloists per year.  Kempe Studio of The Rudolf Kempe Society, whose patron is Dame Judy Dench, is based in a house at 58 Waterside called The Muses and hosts musical events and masterclass lessons. No. 1 Shakespeare Street holds regular evenings of live music.\n\n\n=== Museums and Shakespeare's houses ===\nTudor World is a museum which explores the time when Shakespeare lived. It is based in a Grade II* listed town centre Tudor property and is the only museum in the country dedicated to Tudor times. Every week there is a walk around the town with Shakespeare. The Mechanical Art and Design museum, but better known as MAD museum, is a museum in Henely Street of \"brilliant-but-bonkers machines\" made by Kinetic artists. Items on show include mechanised flipbooks and a musical typewriter.\n\nThere are five houses relating to Shakespeare's life which are owned and cared for by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. These include Hall's Croft (the one-time home of Shakespeare's daughter, Susanna, and her husband Dr. John Hall) and Nash's House, which stands alongside the site of New Place which was owned by Shakespeare himself, wherein he died. In Shottery is Anne Hathaway's Cottage, the home of Shakespeare's wife's family prior to her marriage. Mary Arden's House (Palmer's Farm), the family home of his mother, is in Wilmcote. Elsewhere in the district are farms and buildings at Snitterfield, that belonged to the family of Shakespeare's father.\nIn addition, King Edward VI School, located on the corner of Church Street and Chapel Lane, is a grammar school thought to have been attended by William Shakespeare. In 2016, the school room where Shakespeare is believed to have studied opened to visitors.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nStratford has one library, located in Henley Street within a medieval building. Since 2008, Stratford has hosted the Stratford-upon-Avon Literary Festival, which holds two literary events a year, with one event in spring and a shorter festival in autumn. The festival has talks from celebrity guests, workshops and educational programmes and has become one of the most noted literary festivals in the country, with speakers including: Kirsty Wark, Alan Johnson MP, Baroness Shirley Williams, Tom Kerridge, Sir Tim Rice, John McCarthy, Michael Rosen, Howard Jacobson, Jeffrey Archer, Michael Palin, Jeremy Paxman, Alastair Campbell and Paul Merton.\n\n\n=== Shakespeare's celebrations ===\nEvery year, Shakespeare's birthday is celebrated in Stratford. The celebration takes place over two days on the weekend closest to 23 April, the date of his birth, and includes musical performances, drama and a parade through the town. In 2016, events were held in Stratford to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death.\n\n\n=== Pubs ===\nThe Garrick Inn is reputedly the oldest pub in Stratford, with an inn existing on the site since medieval times. The Dirty Duck, located along Waterside, is a popular pub for actors performing at the nearby RSC theatres.\nFor the last ten years, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has held a beer and cider festival in the town.\n\n\n== Streets ==\n\n\n=== Henley Street ===\n\nHenley Street, one of the town's oldest streets, underwent substantial architectural change between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. John Shakespeare's large half-timbered dwelling, purchased by him in 1556, was in 1564 the birthplace of his son William. According to a descriptive placard provided for tourists there,\n\n\"The property remained in the ownership of Shakespeare's direct descendants until 1670, when his granddaughter, Elizabeth Barnard, died. As she had no children, Elizabeth left the estate to her relative Thomas Hart, Shakespeare's great-nephew. The main house became a tenanted inn called the Maidenhead (later the Swan and Maidenhead) following the death of John Shakespeare in 1601. Members of the Hart family continued living in the small adjoining cottage throughout the century.\"\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Edward Gibbs \"renovated\" the building to more closely represent the original Tudor farmhouse. Adjacent to Shakespeare's Birthplace stands the Shakespeare Centre, completed in 1964 and not far from the Carnegie Library, opened in 1905.\nThe large half-timbered building which now comprises numbers 19, 20 and 21 was formerly the White Lion Inn. It is first mentioned in 1603. and was adjoined on the east by a smaller inn called the \"Swan\". In 1745 the latter was purchased by John Payton, who also acquired the \"Lion\" five years later and rebuilt the whole premises on a greatly enlarged scale. (Cal. of Trust Title Deeds, no. 147.) The work was completed by James Collins of Birmingham, builder, in 1753. (Contract, Trust Title Deeds, no. 167.) Payton \"brought the house into great vogue\" though Byng in 1792 complained that \"at the noted White Lion, I met with nothing but incivility\" (cited from Torrington Diaries (ed. Andrews), iii, 152). Payton was succeeded as innkeeper by his son John, and its reputation as one of the best inns on the Holyhead road must have contributed not a little to the prosperity of the town. Garrick stayed at the \"White Lion\" during the Jubilee of 1769 (Saunders MSS. 82, fol. 20) and George IV, as Prince Regent, visited it when he came to Stratford in 1806. Its great days came to an end after John Payton the younger sold it to Thomas Arkell in 1823. The building is now home to the Enchanted Manor Museum at the Creaky Cauldron and Magic Alley; the Box Brownie Caf\u00e9; Doug Brown's Really Good Gift Company; and the Not Just Shakespeare Tourist Information Centre.\nHenley Street is now a major tourist and shopping precinct with many al fresco caf\u00e9s and street entertainers.\n\n\n=== Sheep Street ===\n\nSheep Street runs from Ely Street eastwards to the Waterside. It was a residential quarter in the 16th century, some of the buildings were rebuilt following the fire of 1595, although many, such as Number 40, date from 1480. Formerly a two-story building that was extended in the early twentieth century has a lower story of substantial close-set studding: the upper is of more widely spaced thin vertical timbers.\nAs the name suggests Sheep Street, which leads down from the Town Hall to Waterside and the RST, was from early times and until the late 19th century, the area where sheep, brought from the neighbouring Cotswold Hills to be bought and sold. Today it is the restaurant centre of the town.\nThe Shrieves House is one of the oldest still lived in houses in the town and Shakespeare is said to have based his character of Sir John Falstaff on one of the residents, his godson's uncle. Oliver Cromwell is thought to have stayed here in 1651. He wrote a letter from the town to Lord Wharton on 27 August 1651, before the Battle of Worcester.\nBehind The Shrieves House is a museum called \"Tudor World\" with recreations of 16th century life in theatrical settings.\nJust off Sheep Street is Shrieves walk, a very quaint walkway with several small independent stores, including a Vintage Clothing shop.\n\n\n=== Waterside and Southern Lane ===\n\nThis area of Stratford, which runs from the foot of Bridge Street to Holy Trinity Church (and leads directly off Sheep Street and Chapel Lane) runs alongside the River Avon and offers access to the Waterside Theatre and all areas of the RST.\nThe Bancroft Gardens and river area is a very popular place for people watching, enjoying picnics and river activities. In the summer the River Avon is busy with rowing boats, motor boats and river cruises. The Birmingham to Stratford Canal is busy with colourful narrowboats passing through or mooring up in the canal basin Stratford-upon-Avon Canal. There are often jugglers, fire-eaters and magicians entertaining the public on the lawns. On the edge of the gardens is a water fountain, known as the Swan Fountain. It was unveiled in 1996 by the Queen Elizabeth II to recognise that Stratford has been a market town since 1196. It is from here the Stratford Town Walk meet every day (even Christmas Day), to offer a guided walking tour of the town. The tour passes the Shakespeare houses, Royal Shakespeare Theatres, 15th century timber-framed buildings, William Shakespeare's school and visits Holy Trinity Church where Shakespeare was baptised and is buried.\nWaterside is also the location of The Dirty Duck pub which is frequented by actors from the nearby RSC theatres, theatre critics and theatregoers.\n\n\n== Other attractions ==\nHarvard House is located at 26 High Street. Other attractions include the Stratford Butterfly Farm, which is on the eastern side of the river and the Bancroft Gardens and Stratford Armouries located three miles (4.8 km) from the centre of Stratford on Gospel Oak Lane.\nEach year on 12 October (unless this is a Sunday, in which case 11 October) Stratford hosts one of the largest mop fairs in the country. Ten days later, the smaller Runaway fair is held.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nStratford is 22 miles (35 km) from the UK's second largest city, Birmingham, and is easily accessible from junction 15 of the M40 motorway. The 7 miles (11 km) \u00a312 million Stratford Northern Bypass opened in June 1987 as the A422.\nStratford-upon-Avon railway station has good rail links from Birmingham (Snow Hill station, Moor Street station) and from London, with up to seven direct trains a day from London Marylebone. Stratford-upon-Avon Parkway railway station opened on 19 May 2013 to the north of the town.\nThe Stratford on Avon and Broadway Railway Society aims to re-open the closed railway line from Stratford-upon-Avon to Honeybourne, with a later extension to Broadway, Worcestershire. The Honeybourne Line is being extended towards Honeybourne from Cheltenham Racecourse to connect with the Cotswold Line. The Cotswold trains run by Great Western Railway go to Worcester Shrub Hill, Worcester Foregate Street, Great Malvern and Hereford westwards and eastwards to Oxford, Reading and Paddington. Rail passengers currently have a very long and inconvenient journey via Birmingham Moor Street (changing here for Birmingham New Street) or continuing on via Birmingham Snow Hill, and onwards to reach Worcester Shrub Hill and places westwards. Rail passengers heading eastwards to Oxford and Reading would have to change trains at Banbury. The Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway connected Stratford with the main line of the London and North Western Railway at Blisworth until passenger trains were withdrawn in 1952.\nThe town has numerous cycle paths, and is the terminus of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal where it meets the Avon. A park and ride scheme was launched in 2006. The Stratford greenway is a 5 miles (8.0 km) traffic free cycle path, which used to be part of the rail network until the early 1960s and is now part of the Sustrans National Cycle Network (routes NCR 5 and NCR 41). Starting from town it heads along the river and racecourse towards Welford-on-Avon and Long Marston with a cycle hire and caf\u00e9 available at the start of the Greenway at Seven Meadows Road.\n\nThe manually powered Stratford-upon-Avon chain ferry was opened in 1937 and links Waterside, roughly halfway between the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and Holy Trinity Church, with the water meadows on the opposite side of the river. It was the last of its kind to be built in Britain.\nBirmingham airport is 18 miles (29 km) to the north-west, with scheduled flights to many national and international destinations.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nStratford is also home to several institutions set up for the study of Shakespeare, including the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which holds books and documents related to the playwright, and the Shakespeare Institute.\nWilliam Shakespeare is believed to have studied at King Edward VI School.

            "content": "Creedmoor Psychiatric Center is a psychiatric hospital in Queens Village, Queens, New York, United States that provides inpatient, outpatient and residential services for severely mentally ill patients. The practical nurses and nurse assistants lived and worked on the property. The history of the hospital and its campus, which occupies more than 300 acres (1.2 km2) and includes more than 50 buildings, reflects both the urbanization of the borough of Queens, and a series of changes in psychiatric care.\n\n\n== Early history of the site ==\n\nThe hospital's name derives from the Creeds, a family that previously farmed the site. The local railroad station on a line that ran from Long Island City to Bethpage took the name Creedmoor, apparently from the phrase \u201cCreed\u2019s Moor,\u201d describing the local geography, In the early 1870s, New York State purchased land from the Creeds for use by the National Guard and by the National Rifle Association (NRA) as a firing range. The Creedmoor Rifle Range hosted prestigious international shooting competitions, which became the forerunner of the Palma Trophy competition. In 1892, as a result of declining public interest and mounting noise complaints from the growing neighborhood, the NRA deeded its land back to the state.\n\n\n== History of the hospital ==\nIn 1912, the Farm Colony of Brooklyn State Hospital was opened, with 32 patients, at Creedmoor by the Lunacy Commission of New York State, reflecting a trend towards sending the swelling population of urban psychiatric patients to the fresh air of outlying areas. By 1918, Creedmoor\u2019s own census had swollen to 150, housed in the abandoned National Guard barracks. By 1959, the hospital housed 7,000 inpatients. Creedmoor is described as a crowded, understaffed institution in Susan Sheehan's Is There No Place On Earth For Me? (1982), a biography of a patient pseudonymously called Sylvia Frumkin. Dr. Lauretta Bender, child neuropsychiatrist, has been reported as practicing there in the 1950s and 1960s. In the late 1970s, one of its more notorious patients was former NYPD officer Robert Torsney, who was committed there in December, 1977 after being found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1976 murder of then 15-year-old Randolph Evans in Brooklyn and was kept there until July, 1979 when reviewers declared him no longer a threat.\nThe hospital's census had declined by the early 1960s, however, as the introduction of new medications, along with the deinstitutionalization movement for many psychiatric patients. In 1975, the land in Glen Oaks formerly used to raise food for the hospital was opened to the public as the Queens County Farm Museum. Another part of the campus in Glen Oaks was developed into the Queens Children's Psychiatric Center. In 2004, the remaining part of Creedmoor land in Glen Oaks was developed into the Glen Oaks public school campus, including The Queens High School of Teaching. By 2006, other parts of the Creedmoor campus had been sold and the inpatient census was down to 470. A more recent portrayal of life in Creedmoor appears in Katherine Olson's Something More Wrong (2013).\nThere are several unused buildings on the property, including the long-abandoned Building 25. Many parts of the building are covered in bird guano, the largest pile being several feet high.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nMusician Lou Reed and jazz pianist Bud Powell were treated at Creedmoor. Legendary folksinger Woody Guthrie, who had been institutionalized for years while suffering from Huntington's disease, was transferred to Creedmoor in June 1966 and died there in October 1967.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nThe hospital\u2019s notable ventures include The Living Museum, which showcases artistic works by patients and is the first museum of its kind in the U.S.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPsychiatry\nQueens Village, Queens\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website Creedmoors official page at the New York State Office of Mental Health\nGoode, Erica (July 30, 2002). \"A CONVERSATION WITH: Janos Marton; A Protected Space, Where Art Comes Calling\".

He immigrated to the United States and now is based in Los Angeles. In Armenia, he started with the rock formation Lav Eli. He developed his solo career starting in 2001 with a number of albums in various genres including pop, rock, and folk music. He sings in both English and Armenian.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== In band Lav Eli ===\n\nGor was widely known throughout Armenia as the lead guitarist for one of country's best rock bands, Lav Eli (in Armenian \u053c\u0561\u057e \u0567\u056c\u056b) that he established with fellow musician Mher Manukyan in 1996.\nThe original set-up was:\nMher Manukyan - vocals and guitar\nGor Mkhitaryan - guitar, backing vocals\nVahe Terteryan - bass\nDavit Grigoryan - drums\nLater on, with bassist Vahe Terteryan leaving, the band was accentuated with three new members including a new bass player:\nTigran Voskanyan - bass\nBagrat Aznavouryan - guitar, backing vocals\nShogher manukyan - cello\nBesides Lav Eli, Mkhitaryan also worked with the group Snack.\n\n\n=== In Force Major project ===\nForce Major (in Aremenian \u0556\u0585\u0580\u057d \u0544\u0561\u056a\u0578\u0580) was Mkhitarian's one-year experimental jam project established in 2000. Stylized as FORCE MAJOR, it was made up of:\nGor Mkhitarian - guitars, percussion\nVahe Terteryan - bass\nDavit Grigoryan - drums\nShaun Hall - keyboard\nEdgar Sargsyan - guitar\nGuest musicians included Anush (flute), Diana (violin), Artyom (dhol), Aharon (guitar) and Mher Bekchyan (vocals). The project released a 5-track EP Force Major\n\n\n=== Solo ===\nMkhitarian launched his solo career in 2001 with his debut solo album Yeraz and has released six more albums since: Godfather Tom (2003), Episode (2004), self-titled GOR (2006), Acoustic Folklore (2007), United Fantasies: Exit Ahead (2008) and Spirit (2009). Having been nominated for 14 industry music awards, he makes fresh and compelling music that successfully fuses traditional Armenian music with both rock and folk idioms.\nIn 2003, Mkhitarian moved to Los Angeles where drummer Andranik Harutyunyan, bassist Varoujan Hovakimyan, pianist Art Grigorian and guitarist Jay Dean joined the band. Stepping away from his previous acoustic-driven \"signature\", with the new band he features remarkable musicianship and showcases a different approach to his songwriting.\nGor Mkhitarian cites Simon & Garfunkel, Sting, and The Dave Matthews Band, to name a few, as strongly influencing his music. Traces of Armenian folk troubadours Ruben Hakhverdyan and Harout Bezjian as well as Bob Dylan can at times be heard in Mkhitarian's solo material.\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2007 Armenian Music Awards Winner\u2014Best Alternative Folk Album (\"Acoustic Folklore\")\n2006 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Rock Album (\"GOR\")\n2006 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Music Video (\"Stigma\")\n2005 Armenian Music Awards Winner\u2014Best Music Video (\"Wherever\")\n2005 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Original Song (\"Cold Wagon 1993\")\n2005 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Folk-Rock Album (\"Episode\")\n2004 Big Apple Music Awards Winner\u2014Best Contemporary Singer (\"Episode\")\n2004 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Alternative Folk Album (\"Godfather Tom\")\n2004 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Album Cover-Design (\"Godfather Tom\")\n2002 Armenian Music Awards Winner\u2014Best Album Cover-Design (\"Yeraz\")\n2002 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Alternative Folk Album (\"Yeraz\")\n2002 Armenian Music Awards Nomination\u2014Best Newcomer (Gor Mkhitarian)\n2002 Just Plain Folks Nomination\u2014Best Ethnic/World Music Song (\"Yeraz\")\n2002 Just Plain Folks Nomination\u2014Best Ethnic/World Music Album (\"Yeraz\")\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Albums ===\nIn Lav Eli\n1995: Aha yev menk (in Armenian \u00ab\u0531\u0570\u0561 \u0587 \u0574\u0565\u0576\u0584\u00bb)\n1996: First Lav Album (in Armenian \u00ab\u0531\u057c\u0561\u057b\u056b\u0576 \u053c\u0531\u054e \u0531\u056c\u0562\u0578\u0574\u00bb)\n1999: Essays (in Armenian \u00ab\u0537\u057d\u057d\u0565\u0576\u0565\u0580\u00bb)\n2006: Notes From Vanadzor \u2013 Urban Armenian Rock\nSolo\n2001: Yeraz (in Armenian \u00ab\u0535\u0580\u0561\u0566\u00bb)\n2003: Godfather Tom (in Armenian \u00ab\u053f\u0576\u0584\u0561\u0570\u0561\u0575\u0580 \u0539\u0578\u0574\u00bb)\n2004: Episode\n2006: GOR (in Armenian \u00ab\u0533\u0578\u057c\u00bb)\n2007: Acoustic Folklore\n2008: United Fantasies: Exit Ahead\n2009: Spirit (in Armenian \u00ab\u0540\u0578\u0563\u056b\u00bb)\n\n\n== Videography ==\n\"Wherever\" [1]\n\"STIGMA\" [2]\n\"Inchu Bingyole Mtar\" [3]\n\"Blessing\" [4]\n\"About God\" [5]\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGor Mkhitarian at Armeniapedia\nGor Mkhitarian on Facebook\nGor Mkhitarian on MSN Music\nGor Mkhitarian on Myspace\nLav Eli website",
